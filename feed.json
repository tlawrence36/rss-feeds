      "A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial, but he has demanded a second opinion at a court hearing",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial, but he demanded a second opinion at a Thursday court hearing.",
      "Jimmy Wayne Carwyle a 48-year-old from Mississippi, appeared while in custody behind glass at a Hollywood courthouse that specializes in mental health cases. He had a long, gray beard and wore a thick, blue smock that jails use for suicide prevention.",
      "A county-appointed psychiatrist who evaluated Carwyle found the defendant incompetent, Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge as he stood near his client with glass separating them. But Krauss said Carwyle, as is his right, would like an evaluation from a different psychiatrist.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Maria Cavaluzzi ordered the reevaluation and set another hearing for May 29.",
      "Krauss declined comment outside court, as did the prosecutor handling the case and an attorney observing the hearing on behalf of Aniston.",
      "Prosecutors allege Carwyle had been harassing the \u201cFriends\u201d star with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, causing major damage.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and vandalism at his first court appearance, where a judge paused the criminal proceedings so he could undergo the psychological evaluation.",
      "Carwyle remains jailed, but he is under a judge's order not to contact or get near Aniston.",
      "Authorities said Aniston was home at the time of the gate crash, but he did not come into contact with her. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. No one was injured.",
      "Carwyle also faces an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm. If convicted, he could get up to three years in prison. If Carwyle is found incompetent again, the judge could order him to be sent to a state mental hospital for treatment and ongoing evaluation.",
      "Other than asking for the protective order for Aniston, prosecutors have not given their position on Carwyle's competency status, and did not speak at Thursday's hearing.",
      "Aniston became one of the biggest stars in television in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends.\u201d She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

    "story": [
      "Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hasn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years",
      "CANNES, France -- Before this week, the dissident Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi hadn\u2019t attended the premiere of one of his films in more than 15 years.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "These and other films of Panahi\u2019s premiered to considerable acclaim at international film festivals where the director\u2019s conspicuous absence was sometimes noted by an empty chair. When his last film, 2022\u2019s \u201cNo Bears,\u201d debuted, he was in jail. Only after his hunger strike made worldwide news was Panahi \u2014 who had gone to Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison to inquire about his friend, the then-jailed filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof \u2014 released, in early 2023.",
      "Two years later, with his travel ban finally lifted, Panahi arrived at the Cannes Film Festival with a film, \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d riven with the fury and pain of incarceration by the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cBeing here does matter, of course. But what\u2019s even more important is that the film is here,\u201d Panahi said in an interview on a Palais terrace. \u201cEven when I went to jail, I was happy that the film was done. I didn\u2019t mind being in prison because my job was done.\u201d",
      "Yet Panahi\u2019s appearance in Cannes, where the film premiered Tuesday, carries tremendous meaning \u2014 and risk \u2014 for a filmmaker who has played such a massive role in international cinema in absentia. But for a director who has previously had his films smuggled out of Iran on USB drives, risk is a constant for Panahi.",
      "\u201cYes, this is an ongoing risk,\u201d he says, speaking through an interpreter. \u201cNow it will probably be higher. But the Iran situation is unpredictable. It changes everyday. New politics everyday. So we have to see what happens the day we go back.\u201d",
      "Last year, in order to reach Cannes, Panahi\u2019s countryman Rasoulof crossed the Iranian border on foot before resettling in Germany. (His film, \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig,\u201d was ultimately nominated for best international film at the Oscars.) Panahi says they speak every other day. After the premiere of \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d Rasoulof texted Panahi to congratulate him on the moment.",
      "Unlike Rasoulof, though, Panahi \u2014 whose \u201cNo Bears\u201d captured him emotionally gazing across, but not crossing, the border \u2014 has no plans to flee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m flying back to Tehran on Sunday,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "What Panahi does have, as his latest film shows once again, is the ability to deftly lace complicated feelings of resistance, sorrow and hope into gripping movies of elegant, if heartbreaking, composition.",
      "In \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\u201d which is in competition for the Palme d\u2019Or in Cannes, a man named Vahid (played by Vahid Mobasser) believes he sees his former captor and torturer. Though blindfolded while imprisoned, Vahid recognizes the sound of the man's prosthetic leg. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In this strange odyssey, they are all forced to confront revenge or forgiveness for the man who ruined their lives. Panahi drew from his own imprisonment but also from the stories of detainees jailed alongside him.",
      "\u201cIt was the experience of all these people I met in prison, mixed with my own perception and experience,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cFor instance, the fact of never seeing the face of your interrogator is everyone\u2019s experience. But then the people who have spent over a decade in prison have more experience than myself, so I\u2019ve been very sensitive to their narratives.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d may be Panahi\u2019s most politically direct film yet. It\u2019s certainly his most anguished. That\u2019s a product of not just his personal experience in prison but of the protests in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini.",
      "\u201cI think ultimately violence will be inevitable. And it\u2019s exactly what the regime wants, because it gives a justification to the repression,\u201d says Panahi. \u201cThe longer they remain and the more pressure they put on the people, the more the people will feel that they have no other solution. And that\u2019s when it will get dangerous.\u201d",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Panahi is without hope.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians\u2019 struggle and fight for freedom is extremely precious,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat people are doing is so impressive. The regime is just trying to divide us. That\u2019s all they focus on now, to create division between the people.\u201d",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won't allow him to make the films he wants to. So committed is he to making film, he notes that the downside to being able to travel is that he might have to spend a year promoting his film, instead of making the next one. On Thursday, Neon acquired the North American distribution rights.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing else I can do. Maybe if I had other abilities, I would have changed to something else,\u201d Panahi says. \u201cWhen you know that\u2019s the only thing you can do, you find ways. Now, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. It was harder at the beginning. There were less people doing underground films. We started this fashion, in a way, so there are ways we have learned and practiced, many of us.\u201d",
      "More than perhaps any filmmaker on earth, you can expect Panahi to find a way to keep making movies, no matter the circumstances.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he nods, \u201cat least.\u201d",

      "SAN DIEGO -- The music agency Sound Talent Group said Thursday that three of its employees, including co-founder Dave Shapiro, died on the private plane that crashed into a San Diego neighborhood.",
      "Shapiro is listed as the owner of the plane and has a pilot\u2019s license, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Shapiro also owned a flight school called Velocity Aviation and a record label, Velocity Records, according to his LinkedIn page.",
      "The agency didn\u2019t share the names of the other two employees who died.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today\u2019s tragedy,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Sound Talent Group has represented artists including American pop band Hanson, American singer-songwriter Vanessa Carlton, and Canadian rock group Sum 41. Hanson is perhaps best known for its earworm 1990s pop hit, \u201cMMMBop.\u201d",
      "American rock bands such as rosecoloredworld and Concrete Castles and the Japanese heavy metal band, Nemophila, are signed to Shapiro\u2019s Velocity Records.",
      "Shapiro also owned a flight school, Velocity Aviation.",
      "San Diego authorities earlier said two people had died. The total number of fatalities is unknown, but six people were on board the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "The private jet crashed early Thursday into a neighborhood of U.S. Navy-owned housing in San Diego during foggy weather, igniting at least one home and numerous vehicles parked on the street. The plane clipped power lines before slamming into the house, said Elliot Simpson with the National Transportation Safety Board.",
      "Several people were injured while trying to flee after the crash just before 4 a.m. in Murphy Canyon, the largest neighborhood of Navy-owned housing in the country. Others were treated for smoke inhalation, authorities said.",
      "At least one home was destroyed with its front heavily burned and its roof partially collapsed. About 10 others suffered damage at the site where half a dozen vehicles were melted and scorched into burned shells.",
      "Ariya Waterworth said she woke up to a \u201cwhooshing sound\u201d and then saw a giant fireball outside. She screamed for help as firefighters arrived and helped her get out with her two children and their family dog.",
      "One of the family\u2019s cars was \u201ccompletely disintegrated,\u201d and the other had extensive damage. Her yard was littered with plane parts, broken glass and debris.",
      "\u201cI definitely do feel blessed because we\u2019ve been spared,\u201d she said.",
      "San Diego police officer Anthony Carrasco said five people from a single family were taken to a hospital for smoke inhalation after evacuating to a nearby school. Another person was treated at a hospital for injuries sustained while climbing out of a window trying to flee. Two others were treated for minor injuries at the scene.",
      "At least 100 residents were evacuated, police said, with surrounding blocks cordoned off with yellow police tape and checkpoints. Jet fuel rolled down Salmon Street hours after the crash. The smell of fuel lingered in the air while authorities worked to extinguish one stubborn car fire that sent smoke billowing up.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,\u201d San Diego Police Chief Scott Wahl said.",
      "The tracking site FlightAware shows Shapiro\u2019s Cessna Citation II jet took off from Teterboro, New Jersey, Wednesday night and flew to Wichita, Kansas. Simpson said the plane made a fueling stop in Kansas before continuing on to San Diego. The New Jersey airport where the flight originated is about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from Manhattan and is an airfield frequently used by private and corporate jets.",
      "Audio recorded by www.liveATC.net includes a brief transmission from the pilot calling out that he was on final approach to the Montgomery-Gibbs airport and was about 3 miles out at 3:45 a.m.",
      "Christopher Moore, who lives one street over from the crash site, said he and his wife were awakened by a loud bang. They grabbed their three young boys and ran out of the house. On their way out of the neighborhood, they saw a car engulfed in flames.",
      "\u201cIt was definitely horrifying for sure, but sometimes you\u2019ve just got to drop your head and get to safety,\u201d he said.",
      "Police officers rescued multiple animals, including three husky puppies that were rolled away in a wagon. A few blocks away, families, including Moore's, stood in a parking lot waiting to learn when they could return to their homes.",
      "Eddy said it was very foggy at the time the private plane crashed in the neighborhood about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the Montgomery-Gibbs airport. \u201cYou could barely see in front of you,\" he said.",
      "City Councilmember Raul Campillo said residents told him dramatic stories \u201cabout military families helping military families out of their homes, jumping out of windows and avoiding fire.\u201d",
      "The FAA said the NTSB will lead the investigation.",
      "At that hour and in foggy weather, the plane was likely operating on an instrument flight rules plan, which is typically used during reduced visibility, said Barry Newman, a board-certified aviation attorney.",
      "However, for that airport, once the aircraft reaches 673 feet (205 meters), the pilot also has to rely on his sight.",
      "\u201cIf a pilot descends to that level and he can\u2019t see the runway, he has to call for a missed approach or divert to another airport,\u201d Newman said.",
      "In October 2021, a twin-engine plane plowed into a San Diego suburb, killing the pilot and a UPS delivery driver on the ground and burning homes. It was preparing to land at the airport.",

      "The popular melodic rapper is expected to take the stand Thursday and tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs\u2019 ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "According to court filings and testimony, the Cassie-Cudi relationship, which grew out of the two working on music together, sent Combs into rages in which he beat her. Prosecutors contend that Combs was so upset he arranged to have Cudi\u2019s convertible firebombed.",

      "She has completed a legal apprenticeship and is now eligible to take the California bar exam, her representative confirmed Wednesday.",
      "The entrepreneur and reality TV star posted an Instagram Story from a small private ceremony at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where she smiled as she donned a graduation cap.",
      "Jessica Jackson, a lawyer who mentored her in the program, called it \u201cone of the most inspiring legal journeys we've ever seen.\u201d",
      "\u201cSix years ago, Kim Kardashian walked into this program with nothing but a fierce desire to fight for justice,\u201d Jackson says in a speech in the video. \u201cNo law school lectures, no ivory tower shortcuts, just determination. And a mountain of case law books to read.\u201d",
      "California allows people to study under a lawyer or judge as an alternative to law school. Kardashian could become a licensed lawyer if she passes the state's notoriously difficult state bar exam.",
      "Jackson said Kardashian spent \u201c18 hours a week, 48 weeks a year for six straight years\u201d on the program.",
      "Her late father, Robert Kardashian, was an attorney and counted O.J. Simpson among his clients.",

      "\u201cI was certain that was the moment that he was going to rape me,\u201d she told a Paris court May 13 about the ordeal. \u201cI absolutely did think I was going to die.\u201d",
      "Kardashian has in recent years been a criminal justice reform advocate and in 2018 successfully lobbied President Donald Trump to commute the sentence of Alice Marie Johnson, a grandmother who was serving a life sentence without parole for drug offenses.",

      "The Metropolitan Police force said Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh, 27, was charged under the Terrorism Act with displaying a flag in support a proscribed organization. The alleged offense happened at the Kentish Town Forum, a London venue, on Nov. 21, 2024.",

      "The New York Giants will get another shot, too, after their uncomfortable debut.",
      "The NFL announced Wednesday at the spring owners meetings that the Bills, led by quarterback Josh Allen, were selected for the behind-the-scenes show on HBO that's in its 25th year. The five-part series will air on Tuesdays beginning on Aug. 5.",
      "The NFC East was also picked as the featured division on the in-season show, with filming of the Giants, Dallas Cowboys, Washington Commanders and defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles set to air in December. The league reached a new multi-year deal with HBO to continue to broadcast the show.",
      "The Bills, who hold their training camp off-site at St. John Fisher University outside of Rochester, New York, have entered their ninth year under head coach Sean McDermott. Still seeking their first championship, having not appeared in the Super Bowl since their fourth consecutive loss following the 1993 season, the Bills have won five straight AFC East titles and qualified for the playoffs in seven of the past eight years.",
      "Allen has been a driver of that success, entering his eighth season and coming off his first MVP award. The Bills return a majority of their offense from a team that finished second in the NFL in scoring in the 2024 season. They retooled their defense, starting with the addition in free agency of edge rusher Joey Bosa.",
      "The NFL revamped its rules last year around \u201cHard Knocks\u201d appearances, previously allowing teams that made the playoffs within the previous two seasons to decline to participate. Such an opt-out is no longer an option. Teams now ineligible for selection include those with a first-year head coach, those that have appeared on the training camp version of the show in the past eight seasons, and those picked for the in-season version focusing on one division.",
      "The Chicago Bears were a first-time \u201cHard Knocks\u201d participant last season during training camp. HBO and co-producer NFL Films last year added the in-season show, filming around the four AFC North teams, and an offseason version that premiered \u2014 and perhaps ended \u2014 with a focus on the Giants.",
      "The awkward goodbye between running back Saquon Barkley and general manager Joe Schoen was a prominent part of that series, which has so far not been renewed.",
      "Barkley, who signed with the rival Eagles and went on to win the Super Bowl, later complained that his side of the conversation with Schoen was recorded and aired without his consent.",
      "Schoen's informing Barkley that the Giants would not make him a contract offer or put the franchise tag on him and thus let him become a free agent became a must-see scene, along with a pained reaction from owner John Mara about losing a popular player.",

      "On April 21, Milton police responded to a home in the town north of Atlanta after a 911 report described \u201ca possible domestic disturbance,\u201d police said in a statement. A neighbor had heard yelling and screaming, and saw a woman crying, officers wrote in their initial report.",
      "Officers determined that the call was related to a previously unreported burglary and the discharge of a firearm at the location, police said. They later obtained arrest warrants for Green, who lived there.",
      "The charges include aggravated assault, conspiracy to commit a felony, criminal damage to property and pointing or aiming a gun at someone, Fulton County Jail records show. He's also accused of tampering with evidence \u2014 a felony \u2014 and obstruction of law officers.",

In the back of the home near the swimming pool, officers found a broken window and a hammer in a bush next to it. A black Glock handgun was also found at the scene, officers wrote.",
      "The initial report does not list any suspects who might have broken in, emptied the safe or shot the vehicles, nor does it accuse Green of committing any crimes.",

      "The 26-year-old Florida rapper is celebrated for his soul-trap sound, a unique melding of R&B and rap that has earned him 11 singles certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

The two had dated for about four years, and the girlfriend told investigators that Green accused her of seeing other men while they were broken up.",

The quest takes them to far-flung places from Vienna to the pyramids, as they try to evade capture by the authorities and a shadowy operation intent on stopping the search.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been looking to watch this movie for years,\u201d Krasinski said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThis is the movie I pretended to be in when I was a kid. This is what got me into the business.\u201d",
      "The film also stars Domnhall Gleeson as the wealthy businessman funding the operation and Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez as one of the protectors of the Fountain of Youth.",
      "\u201c Guy Ritchie gets to work with some of the best cast in the world,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez, who has now worked with him three times. \u201cThe biggest gift Guy has given me, besides the privilege of working with him, is working with them.\u201d",
      "Gleeson, a newcomer to the world of Ritchie, was pretty sure that it was going to be as enjoyable as it looked. And he got a vote of confidence from his director.",
      "\u201cGuy basically said, if you\u2019re not having fun, then this is not going to work and so the idea is to turn up and have fun,\u201d Gleeson said.",
      "There were a lot of things about \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d that piqued Portman\u2019s interest. The chance to work with Ritchie, Krasinski, and the rest of the cast, as well as the travel, but it also felt like something she could share with her own son and daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rare to get to make a movie that has this scale and this scope of adventure that you can watch with your kids,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI\u2019m always looking for something that I can enjoy with my children.\u201d",

We meet her amid a contentious divorce and custody battle over her 12-year-old son, and she\u2019s not exactly pleased when Luke steals a piece of art from her gallery and attempts to recruit her for the bigger mission. But soon, she\u2019s in scuba gear hunting down a lost Rembrandt in the wreckage of the RMS Lusitania.",
      "\u201cI think that something we search for as adults is how to regain that youthful spirit, how to hold onto that youthful energy and freedom and wildness, even when having to move into some adult responsibilities,\u201d said Portman, who, like her character is recently divorced. \u201cMaybe that can make you a better parent to have a little bit of that glint in your eye.\u201d",
      "She and Krasinski, working together for the first time, fell into the sibling dynamics easily.",
      "\u201cThese movies sort of live and die with the relationships,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cThe sibling thing really only works if you\u2019re having genuine fun with the person and it can come off screen. And I laughed with her every single day. She\u2019s so funny.\u201d",
      "Globe-trotting films aren\u2019t just travelogues for the audience, but their own sort of adventure for the cast and crew. This production earned their miles, skipping between the streets of Bangkok and Liverpool, the Austrian National Library in Vienna and Cairo to film at the great pyramids \u2014 where \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d became the first film of this scale to be granted the privilege to shoot action sequences there.",
      "\u201cIt was really a pinch me kind of moment to be like, oh, those are the pyramids and we\u2019re just hanging out here and walking into them and filming in them,\u201d Portman said.",
      "The big first was landing a Boeing Chinook CH47 helicopter in front of the Giza Plateau, and blowing up a jeep, all while the site remained open to tourists.",
      "\u201cWith any luck, we didn\u2019t blow it for Hollywood going back there for somebody else,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cBut if we did, at least we got to do it.\u201d",
      "Most of the big action moments \u201cinside\u201d the pyramids were saved for the safety of sets constructed at London\u2019s Leavesden Studio, where they also built the wreckage of the Lusitania in a water tank so big that it took two weeks to fill.",
      "\u201cFountain of Youth\u201d might seem like the type of movie that would be a natural fit for the big screen: A big budget, global adventure with major stars and sweeping vistas. While Krasinski champions movie theaters \u2014 at the time of the interview, he had a ticket to see \u201cSinners\u201d on IMAX the next day \u2014 he\u2019s also not feeling bittersweet that this one won\u2019t be playing at the multiplex. They all came into \u201cFountain of Youth\u201d knowing that it was a streaming-first endeavor.",
      "\u201cThis was always going to be a streaming movie, so I didn\u2019t really think about it in terms of ... Would people want to see it in theaters because it was just one of those things,\u201d Krasinski said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s the new reality. There are definitely movies that are being made for streaming, and there are movies being made for theatrical.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIt all depends on what the filmmaker\u2019s intent was, what the studio\u2019s intent and I think as long as those rules are laid out clearly in the beginning, I\u2019m down for either one.\u201d",

      "A British judge has ordered Grammy-winning singer Chris Brown released on $6.7 million bail while facing allegations that he beat and seriously injured a music producer in a London nightclub in 2023",
      "LONDON -- A British judge ordered Grammy-winning singer Chris Brown released on 5 million-pound ($6.7 million) bail on Wednesday while facing allegations he beat and seriously injured a music producer with a bottle in a London nightclub in 2023.",
      "The decision by a judge in Southwark Crown Court revives Brown's world tour that was cast in doubt when another judge ordered him held in custody after he was charged last week with causing grievous bodily harm with intent.",
      "Judge Tony Baumgartner said that Brown could continue with this tour, including several stops in the U.K., but would have to pay the bail to guarantee his appearance in court.",
      "Brown was initially scheduled to appear in court again on June 13. If he had been held until then, Brown would have missed at least two dates on his upcoming tour, which starts next month in Europe.",
      "Brown, 36, is accused of launching an unprovoked attack on producer Abe Diaw at the Tape nightclub in the swanky Mayfair neighborhood in February 2023 while he was on last tour.",

      "American musician Omololu Akinlolu, 38, who performs under the name \u201cHoody Baby\u201d and is a friend of Brown, was also charged in the attack.",
      "Neither Brown nor Akinlolu have entered a plea yet. Both men were ordered to appear in court again on June 20.",
      "Brown, who burst onto the music scene as a teen in 2005, won his first Grammy for best R&B album in 2011 for \u201cF.A.M.E.\u201d and then earned his second in the same category for \u201c11:11 (Deluxe)\u201d earlier this year.",

      "Some of Spike Lee\u2019s most deeply felt passions \u2014 filmmaking and the New York Knicks \u2014 have collided at the Cannes Film Festival",
      "CANNES, France -- There\u2019s no sufficient way of explaining what it\u2019s like to be around Spike Lee, but his new film, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d comes pretty close.",
      "The main character, played by Denzel Washington, is a Knicks fan who won\u2019t tolerate Celtics green in his house. A framed jersey of Jalen Brunson hangs in his Brooklyn apartment. There are movie references peppered throughout, of \u201cThe French Connection,\u201d \u201cThe Defiant Ones\u201d and \u201cThe Sweet Smell of Success.\u201d Yankee Stadium plays a pivotal setting. In one scene, Nicholas Turturro even yells directly into the camera: \u201cBoston sucks!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not counting on Boston for box office!\u201d Lee says with a roaring cackle during an interview on a rooftop terrace in Cannes. \u201cWe might as well just write that off.\u201d",
      "Some of Lee\u2019s most deeply felt passions \u2014 filmmaking and the New York Knicks \u2014 have collided at the Cannes Film Festival. The premiere of \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a reimagining of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s \u201cHigh to Low,\u201d came shortly before the Knicks begin their Eastern Conference finals matchup with the Indiana Pacers. Everywhere Lee has gone at the French Riviera festival, he\u2019s gone in blue and orange, including a pinstripe suit on the red carpet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a film by a New Yorker who loves New York. But if you\u2019re not that, it doesn\u2019t detract from you enjoying it. You could be from \u2026 (Lee raises an eyebrow) \u2026 Indiana,\u201d Lee says before letting out a maniacal roar. \u201cWait a minute, we got to write off another market, too!\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d which A24 releases in theaters Aug. 22 before it streams on Apple TV+ on Sept. 5, was one of the most eventful premieres of Cannes. Washington was surprised with a Palme d\u2019Or. (\u201cThat wasn\u2019t acting,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know. Only three or four people knew.\u201d) Washington also got in an angry tangle with a photographer on the red carpet after his arm was grabbed.",
      "\u201cI wish I could\u2019ve told that photographer: \u2018Do not touch Denzel Washington or it\u2019s going to be a (expletive) problem,\u2019\u201d Lee says, laughing. \u201cThe headline, \u2018Man on Fire,\u2019 hoooooo! That was a good headline.\u201d",
      "Lee then picks up the digital recorder lying in front of him and says in a calm, professional voice: \u201cLadies and gentleman, this is a public service announcement. Do not put your hands on Mr. Denzel Washington. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you. Thank you very much.\u201d",
      "But Lee, 68, has been more than happy to mix it up in Cannes. Before an interview, he taunted European journalists about his adopted Premier League team, Arsenal. At the press conference earlier in the day, he quoted Yoda for his primary message to film students: \u201cThere is no try, only do.\u201d Said Lee: \u201cAre you faking the funk or are you serious?\u201d",
      "Lee, who last debuted 2018\u2019s \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d in Cannes, tried to avoid saying anything too pointed about President Donald Trump. But couldn\u2019t help himself when asked about the moral decisions that mark \u201cHighest 2 Lowest.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how much we can talk about American values considering who is president,\u201d Lee told reporters.",
      "Lee was also on an apology tour at the festival. Four years ago, he was the head of the jury that awarded Julia Ducournau\u2019s \u201cTitane\u201d the Palme d\u2019Or. Only Lee, confused by the French-language ceremony, accidentally revealed the winner too soon. \u201cOh, that\u2019s a big one,\u201d said Lee, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s going down in the history of Cannes.\u201d",
      "Just ahead of Lee's interview with The Associated Press, Ducournau, in Cannes with her \u201cTitane\u201d follow-up, \u201cAlpha,\u201d crossed the terrace to warmly embrace him. Recalling \u201cTitane,\u201d Lee said, \u201cA car impregnates a woman? You gotta win. You got my vote.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d has been referred to as a remake of \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d but the degree to which it\u2019s a Spike Lee joint surprised festivalgoers. Washington plays David King, a wealthy record label executive whose son, along with the son of his friend and driver (Jeffrey Wright), is kidnapped for ransom. The kidnapper, played by A$AP Rocky, accidentally releases the wrong young man, leaving King with the decision to fork over the $17.5 million ransom for a young man who\u2019s not his son.",
      "The film is, in part, an ode to Kurosawa, whom Lee discovered as a film student at NYU. He credits his \u201cRashomon\u201d as the basis of \u201cShe\u2019s Gotta Have It.\u201d He met Kurosawa briefly once and has an autograph from the Japanese master signed with a paint brush. \u201cI got to shake his hand,\u201d says Lee.",
      "\u201cI grew up with my mother taking me to musicals,\" he says. \u201cThe Sound of Music\u201d was one. If you listen to that great song by Rogers and Hammerstein with Julie Andrews singing it. What did Coltrane do to it? That\u2019s my analogy. What Coltrane did to \u2018My Favorite Things,\u2019 I think that\u2019s what we did with this.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is less driven as a Kurosawa homage than by Lee\u2019s own obsessions: New York, music, the moral dilemmas of a Black entertainer and, yes, that Boston sucks. Above all, it\u2019s another Lee protagonist forced to do the right thing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad you said that. I never thought about that connected to the decisions David King has to make,\u201d Lee says. \u201cBut what you see is the turmoil he\u2019s going through. He\u2019s going through it. A moral decision. Money on one hand, a life on the other.\u201d",
      "More than any recent film of his, you can sense Lee having fun. Back in New York. Back with Denzel. \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d is Lee and Washington\u2019s fifth film together but the first in 19 years after 2006\u2019s \u201cInside Man.\u201d \"It\u2019s not like we had to catch up,\u201d Lee says. \u201cWe never lost a step.\u201d",
      "But Lee suspects \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d marks the end of their collaboration \u2014 one of cinema\u2019s greatest actor-director pairings, spanning \u201cMo\u2019 Better Blues,\u201d \u201cMalcolm X\u201d and \u201cHe Got Game.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what he says,\u201d Lee shrugs, citing Washington\u2019s retirement plans. \u201cAnd then the other day he\u2019s doing a film with the guy from \u2018City of God,\u2019 so. Denzel put that on himself: \u2018I\u2019m doing this thing and then I\u2019m retiring.\u2019 I\u2019ll believe it when he hangs it up.\u201d",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d reaches a blistering crescendo when King confronts Rocky\u2019s kidnapper in a basement recording studio. A kind of rap battle ensues that Lee gives much of the credit to Washington for. The actor improvised many of his lyrics, drawing heavily from Nas. (\"That was not scripted,\" says Lee. \u201cWe had to pay for that!\u201d)",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t understand. Denzel is such a powerful force. Not a derogatory term, but he\u2019s a beast. If you got somebody who don\u2019t got it, Denzel is going to slaughter them. SLAUGHTER,\" Lee explains. \u201cRocky is from Harlem, uptown. So I knew that he\u2019s not going to punk out. He\u2019s going to stand there, feet planted to the ground, as a heavyweight fight, blow to blow to blow.\u201d",
      "For Lee, the scene is a summation of what he loves about moviemaking and what delights him so much courtside at Madison Square Garden.",
      "\u201cPeople want to see a championship fight, and that\u2019s what it is. That is, in boxing terms, a slugfest,\u201d says Lee. \u201dThat makes great cinema. It makes great sports. You\u2019ve got conflict. It\u2019s a battle, and they\u2019re slugging it out.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Rapper and actor Kid Cudi is expected to testify at the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs sex trafficking trial, taking the witness stand either Wednesday or Thursday to tell the jury about his brief relationship 14 years ago with Combs ex-girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie.",
      "Cassie testified last week that Combs was enraged when she left him for a period of time in 2011 and began dating Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi. She said Combs left a large bruise on her back where he kicked her as she left his Los Angeles home for the last time that year.",
      "Prosecutors have contended in court filings that Combs was so upset that he arranged to have Cudi's convertible firebombed.",
      "A prosecutor said at the end of Tuesday's court session that Mescudi will be the third witness after a federal agent finishes testifying about what investigators found last year when they raided Combs\u2019 home in Florida.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges that he leveraged his fame and fortune to oversee a two-decade-long racketeering enterprise that controlled Cassie and others through threats and violence.",
      "His lawyers say evidence in the case reflects domestic violence, not anything amounting to a criminal racket or sex trafficking.",
      "Cassie testified last week that Combs arranged for her to meet Cudi several times in 2011 to work on music. She said her relationship with Cudi began late in the year and she got a burner phone so the two could communicate without Combs learning about it.",
      "Cassie said she and Combs had broken up at the time, although they still engaged in so-called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d that involved sexual performances with male escorts that Combs watched and sometimes participated in. It was during one of those \u201cfreak-offs\u201d that Combs picked up her regular phone and noticed communications that revealed Cassie was seeing Cudi, Cassie said.",
      "On Tuesday, Cassie's mother, Regina Ventura, testified that she received an email in December 2011 from Cassie saying that Combs was so angry about her relationship with Cudi that he planned to release sexually explicit videos of her and send someone to hurt Cassie and Cudi.",
      "Afterward, Regina Ventura said, she received a demand from Combs for $20,000. Scared for her daughter's safety, she went to the bank and sent Combs the money, only to have it returned by Combs days later.",
      "Cassie testified that Cudi came to visit her at her mother's Connecticut home around Christmas in 2011 and stayed for three or four days. She said she broke up with him.",
      "\u201cIt was just too much,\u201d she said. \u201cToo much danger, too much uncertainty of, like, what could happen if we continued to see each other.\u201d",
      "Cassie said she told her family she was going to Los Angeles after the holidays to \u201cget to work.\u201d But instead, she said, she traveled after New Year's to meet Combs in Arizona, where he had gone to visit a college with his son. They resumed their relationship.",
      "When Cassie and Combs were out of the country, Combs told her that Cudi's car would be blown up and Combs wanted Cudi's friends there to see it, Cassie said.",

      "PARIS -- Police have found a bust of Jim Morrison that was stolen nearly four decades ago from the Paris grave that has long been a place of pilgrimage for fans of the legendary Doors singer and poet.",
      "The bust taken in 1988 from P\u00e8re-Lachaise cemetery was found during an unrelated investigation conducted by a financial anti-corruption unit, Paris police said in an Instagram post Monday.",
      "There was no immediate word on whether the bust would be returned to the grave or what other investigation might take place.",
      "Morrison, the singer of Doors classics including \u201cLight My Fire,\u201d \u201cBreak on Through,\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d was found dead in a Paris bathtub at age 27 in 1971.",
      "He was buried at P\u00e8re-Lachaise, the city's cemetery that is the final resting place of scores of artists, writers and other cultural luminaries including Marcel Proust, Oscar Wilde, Gertrude Stein and Edith Piaf.",
      "The 300-pound bust made by Croatian sculptor Mladen Mikulin was added to the grave in 1981 for the 10th anniversary of the singer's death.",
      "\u201cI think it would be incredible if they put the bust back onto where it was and it would attract so many more people, but the cemetery wouldn\u2019t even be able to hold that many people,\u201d Paris tour guide Jade Jezzini told The Associated Press. \u201cThe amount of people who would rush in here just to see the bust to take pictures of it, it would be incredible.\u201d",
      "Known for his dark lyrics, wavy locks, leather pants, theatrical stage presence and mystical manner, Morrison has inspired generations of acolytes who congregate at his grave to reflect and sometimes to party, including a major gathering for the 50th anniversary of his death. The site has often been covered with flowers, poetic graffiti and liquor bottles left in tribute.",
      "He was undergoing a cultural renaissance when the bust was stolen in the late 1980s, which peaked with the 1991 Oliver Stone film \u201cThe Doors,\u201d in which Val Kilmer, who died in April, played Morrison.",
      "London artist Sam Burcher recently returned to the now more subdued grave site that she first visited 40 years ago when the sculpture of Morrison was still in place.",
      "\u201cThe bust was much smaller than all of these grand tombs. It was very modest, so I was quite surprised by that,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cBut the other thing was the atmosphere, it was buzzing. There were people partying, smoking, music, dancing, and then I brought strawberries and kind of gave them out to everyone ... it was just such an amazing experience.\u201d",
      "Morrison cofounded the Doors in Los Angeles in 1965 with Ray Manzarek. Robby Krieger and John Densmore joined soon after.",
      "The band and its frontman burned brightly but briefly, releasing albums including \u201cThe Doors\u201d \u201cStrange Days,\" and \u201cMorrison Hotel, whose The California site that gave that album its name and cover image was seriously damaged in a fire last year.",
      "After their final album, 1971\u2019s \u201cL.A. Woman,\u201d Morrison moved to Paris. His cause of death was listed as heart failure, though no autopsy was performed as none was required by law. Disputes and myths have surrounded the death and added to his mystique.",

      "The European Union plans to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet",
      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union agreed Tuesday to provide emergency funds to help keep Radio Free Europe afloat after the Trump administration stopped grants to the pro-democracy media outlet, accusing it of promoting a news agenda with a liberal bias.",
      "Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty started broadcasting during the Cold War. Its programs are aired in 27 languages in 23 countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East. Its lawyers have been fighting the administration in court.",

      "She said that she hoped the 27 EU member countries would also provide more funds to help Radio Free Europe longer term. Kallas said the bloc has been looking for \u201cstrategic areas\u201d where it can help as the United States cuts foreign aid.",

    "summary": "Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump aren't new foes",
    "story": [
      "They have some similarities, Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump \u2014 guys in their 70s with homes in New Jersey and big constituencies among white American men middle-aged and older. And both, in very different respects, are the boss.",
      "That's about where it ends.",
      "The veteran rock star, long a political opponent of the president, stood up as one of Trump's most prominent cultural critics last week with a verbal takedown from a British stage.",
      "As is his nature, Trump is fighting back \u2014 hard. He calls Springsteen a \u201cdried out prune of a rocker\u201d and is even bringing Beyonc\u00e9 into the fray.",
      "On Monday, the president suggested Springsteen and Beyonc\u00e9 should be investigated to see if appearances they made on behalf of his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, last fall represented an illegal campaign donation.",
      "Opening a tour in Manchester, England, Springsteen told his audience last Thursday that \u201cthe America I love, the America I've written about that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent and treasonous administration.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cTonight we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring.\"",
      "Springsteen later made reference to an \u201cunfit president and a rogue government\u201d who have \u201cno concern or idea for what it means to be deeply American.\u201d",
      "The next morning, Trump called Springsteen highly overrated. \u201cNever liked him, never liked his music or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he's not a talented guy \u2014 just a pushy, obnoxious JERK,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "\u201cThis dried out prune of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back in the Country,\u201d he said.",
      "The next night, also in Manchester, Springsteen repeated his criticisms.",
      "\u201cIt's no surprise what Springsteen's political leanings are and have been for many decades,\u201d said veteran music writer Alan Light, author of the upcoming \u201cDon't Stop: Why We (Still) Love Fleetwood Mac's Rumours.\u201d \u201cHe's somebody who has been outspoken in his music and his actions.\u201d",
      "The Boss' statements this week showed he wasn't afraid to speak out \u201cat a time when so many people and institutions are just kind of rolling over,\u201d Light said.",
      "It's not the first time Springsteen has spoken out against Trump \u2014 or a Republican president.",
      "When former President Ronald Reagan referenced Springsteen's \u201cmessage of hope\u201d at a campaign stop during the height of the rocker's \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d popularity, Springsteen wondered if Reagan had listened to his music and its references to those left behind in the 1980s economy. He also has had an occasionally bumpy relationship with onetime Republican presidential candidate and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a fan of his music.",
      "Springsteen has campaigned for Trump's opponents, including Harris last fall. In 2020, he said that \u201ca good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotized, brainwashed by a con man from Queens.\u201d",
      "He knows the outer-borough reference still stung a man who built his own tower in Manhattan and ascended to the presidency. Trump often stays at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Springsteen grew up in New Jersey \u2014 you may have heard \u2014 and lives in Colts Neck, New Jersey, now.",
      "Trump doesn't hesitate to go after the biggest musical names that speak out against him, like Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift. But the political risk may be less; their younger, more female audiences are less likely to intersect with Trump's core constituency.",
      "During his career, Springsteen has challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements. The 1995 album \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants \u2014 Mexican and Vietnamese among them. And his 2001 song \u201cAmerican Skin (41 Shots),\" criticized the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fan base.",
      "Clearly, Springsteen has conservative fans and some who wish he'd steer clear of politics, Light said. Still, \u201c40 years later, it's hard to imagine what they think would happen\u201d with Trump, he said.",
      "While Trump made a point to reference Springsteen's criticism in an overseas show, he and the E Street Band haven't performed in the United States since before the 2024 election. His tour last year hit heavily on themes of mortality, less of politics. He has several European tour dates scheduled this year into July and hasn't announced any new American shows.",

      "CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon said Monday that she is resigning after four years, the latest fallout at the network as its parent company considers settling a lawsuit with President Donald Trump over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d with his former political opponent.",
      "McMahon, who has led both the network news division and news for the CBS-owned stations, said in an email message to staff that \u201cit's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It's time to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.\u201d",
      "McMahon has made clear she opposes settling with Trump \u2014 just like \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens, who quit last month.",
      "Trump has sued CBS, alleging it edited an interview with 2024 Democratic opponent Kamala Harris last fall to benefit her. CBS News has denied that. CBS' parent company, Paramount Global, is in talks to potentially settle Trump's lawsuit. At the same time, Paramount Global is seeking administration approval of a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "George Cheeks, co-CEO of Paramount and head of the CBS network, said McMahon's top deputies, CBS News president Tom Cibrowski and CBS Stations president Jennifer Mitchell, will report directly to him.",
      "McMahon, in her note, said that \u201cthe past few months have been challenging.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have spent the last few months shoring up our businesses and making sure the right leaders are in place, and I have no doubt they will continue to set the standard,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to the tussle with Trump, Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, has expressed unhappiness over some network coverage of Israel's war in Gaza, including a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d piece this winter. Paramount began supervising \u201c60 Minutes\u201d stories in new ways, including asking former CBS News President Susan Zirinsky to look over some of its stories before they aired.",
      "That extra layer contributed to Owens' resignation. One of the show's correspondents, Scott Pelley, said on the air that \u201cnone of us is happy\u201d about the changes.",
      "CBS News is also trying to establish the new anchor team of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois at its flagship \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d broadcast amid ratings troubles.",
      "In his note to staff members, Cheeks praised McMahon for expanding local news at CBS stations and improving their competitive positions, along with improving the network's digital offerings.",

      "Frederick Doe, 37, also known as Frederick Sines, was given a suspended sentence at Oxford Crown Court for his role in helping to sell the 18-carat gold fully functioning toilet which was taken in 2019 from Blenheim Palace \u2014 the country mansion where British wartime leader Winston Churchill was born.",
      "\u201cThose responsible for this audacious heist, five individuals could be seen on CCTV, were clearly intent on disposing of their ill-gotten gains quickly,\" Judge Ian Pringle told Doe. \u201cYou foolishly agreed to assist.\u201d",

      "The piece that poked fun at excessive wealth had previously been on display at The Guggenheim Museum, in New York, which had offered the work to U.S. President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.",
      "The theft of the toilet \u2014 which has never been recovered and is believed to have been cut up and sold \u2014 caused considerable damage to the 18th-century property, a UNESCO World Heritage site filled with valuable art and furniture that draws thousands of visitors each year.",

      "Doe, who was convicted of conspiracy to transfer criminal property, was given a two-year suspended term and ordered to perform 240 hours of unpaid work.",

      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Denzel Washington sandwiched a whirlwind trip to the Cannes Film Festival, in between Broadway performances, for the premiere of Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d on Monday \u2014 and was rewarded with a surprise: an honorary Palme d'Or.",
      "Cannes had flipped around some of its scheduling to accommodate Washington's speedy France trip, which came on his lone off-day while performing \u201cOthello\u201d in New York. Cannes Film Festival chief Thierry Fr\u00e9maux surprised Washington with the award before the Monday night premiere.",

      "The festival usually gives out one or two honorary Palmes each edition \u2014 last year, the awardees were Studio Ghibli and George Lucas. Last week, Robert De Niro received one on the festival's opening night. De Niro's award was announced in advance, but surprise prizes aren't unheard of: In 2022, Tom Cruise was presented with a surprise honorary Palme d'Or just before the screening of \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d",
      "The premiere also had another surprise: Rihanna attended and walked the carpet afterward with partner A$AP Rocky. Earlier this month, she revealed at the Met Gala that she was pregnant with their third child.",
      "While the festival's photo calls usually happen the day after a film's premiere, Cannes hosted one for \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d earlier Monday so Washington could attend. The actor, playfully posing with Lee and co-star A$AP Rocky, showed no signs of jet lag and left once the screening began.",
      "\u201cHe told me to tell you: Thank you for the love,\u201d Lee told the crowd after the screening. \u201cHe's on Broadway doing \u2018Othello,\u2019 so it really took a lot for him to fly here. Let's give it up for Denzel Washington, please.\u201d",
      "Lee also came to Cannes with obligations back in New York on his mind. He arrived at the film\u2019s premiere decked out in Knicks colors and wearing a blue and orange striped suit. Lee ended his brief speech in the Palais by hollering: \u201cNew York Knicks!\u201d",
      "That Washington would be able to make the trip had been a sticking point for Cannes. When the festival first announced its lineup last month, \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d wasn't included. Within hours, however, Lee himself announced the film was heading to Cannes. Representatives for the festival said they had been waiting for confirmation that Washington would attend to walk the red carpet.",
      "\u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\u201d a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 film \u201cHigh and Low,\u201d will be released in theaters by A24 on Aug. 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ on Sept. 5.",

      "Gary Lineker, the former England soccer player and now a media celebrity, will step down from his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat",
      "Gary Lineker, the England soccer great-turned-media celebrity, will leave his role as a presenter for the BBC after facing criticism for reposting an Instagram story about Zionism which featured a picture of a rat.",
      "The 64-year-old Lineker, who is the British national broadcaster\u2019s highest-paid presenter on about 1.3 million pounds ($1.7 million) a year, was set to leave flagship soccer highlights show \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d at the end of this season but remain with the BBC to front other soccer coverage, including next year\u2019s men\u2019s World Cup.",
      "However, the BBC said Monday in a statement that Lineker will step down entirely from the corporation after the final \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d episode next weekend in the wake of his decision to share a post from the group, Palestine Lobby, illustrated with a picture of a rat, titled: \u201cZionism explained in two minutes.\u201d",
      "Rats, linked to disease and dirt, have been used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda throughout history, including by the Nazis in 1930s Germany.",
      "\u201cGary has acknowledged the mistake he made,\u201d BBC director-general Tim Davie said. \u201cAccordingly, we have agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season.\u201d",
      "Lineker had already apologized for his conduct, saying last week he reposted material which he subsequently learned contained \u201coffensive references,\u201d adding that he withdrew the post as soon as he became aware of the issue and \u201cwould never knowingly share anything antisemitic.\u201d",
      "Before Lineker\u2019s apology, Davie said the corporation needed people to be the \u201cexemplars of BBC values and follow our social media policies\u201d and that \u201cwhen someone makes a mistake, it costs us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFootball has been at the heart of my life for as long as I can remember \u2014 both on the pitch and in the studio,\u201d Lineker said in the BBC statement. \u201cI care deeply about the game, and about the work I\u2019ve done with the BBC over many years. As I\u2019ve said, I would never consciously repost anything antisemitic \u2014 it goes against everything I stand for.",
      "\u201cHowever, I recognize the error and upset that I caused, and reiterate how sorry I am. Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action.\u201d",
      "In a separate video post on Instagram, Lineker said he had made a \u201cgenuine mistake\u201d and \u201cshould have been more diligent.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have stood up for minorities and humanitarian issues and all forms of racism all of my life, including of course antisemitism, which I absolutely abhor,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for it, and never should be.\u201d",
      "Lineker\u2019s openness to reflect his political views on social media have caused growing friction with the BBC regarding its impartiality guidelines.",
      "He was temporarily suspended from the corporation in March 2023 over comments he made criticizing the then-Conservative government\u2019s new asylum policy. It led to the BBC\u2019s rules on social media posts being rewritten to say presenters of high-profile programs outside news had a \u201cresponsibility to respect the BBC\u2019s impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC.\u201d",
      "Lineker was among 500 high-profile figures who signed an open letter in February urging the BBC to re-broadcast a documentary, \u201cGaza: How to Survive a War Zone,\u201d to its streaming service, BBC iPlayer. The documentary was pulled after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Last week, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph newspaper that came a day after his initial apology, Lineker spoke out about the conduct of Israel in the war against Hamas in Gaza, saying those who stayed silent about it were \u201calmost complicit.\u201d",
      "The BBC has lost something of a national treasure who has become almost as well known a broadcaster as he was a soccer player.",
      "Lineker is one of England\u2019s greatest players \u2014 he scored 48 goals in 80 games for his country and was the leading scorer at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico \u2014 who transitioned into being a slick, witty and knowledgeable TV personality and an all-around media darling, with 8.7 million followers on X and 1.2 million followers on Instagram. He has been the main presenter of BBC\u2019s \u201cMatch of the Day\u201d since 1999 and used his status as a freelancer to work for other broadcasters such as NBC, Al Jazeera and BT Sport.",
      "Lineker, who played his club soccer for Everton, Tottenham and Barcelona, is the co-founder of the hugely successful \u201cGoalhanger\u201d podcasts \u2014 the maker of the popular \u201cThe Rest is History\u201d series and its spin-offs about politics, soccer, entertainment and money.",
      "Lineker\u2019s departure from the BBC was welcomed by the Campaign Against Antisemitism, which said he had become \u201ca symbol of the rot at the heart of our national broadcaster.\u201d",
      "Lineker, the group added, was \u201crepeatedly allowed to flout the BBC\u2019s own rules on impartiality, abusing his position to promote his increasingly propagandist politics, vilifying those he disagrees with, and even promoting dehumanizing and extreme messages.\u201d",
      "Lineker has accepted that being outspoken with his views would make him a target but, for many, it has strengthened his status as one of Britain\u2019s most popular figures.",
      "\u201cGary has been a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades,\u201d Davie said. \u201cHis passion and knowledge have shaped our sports journalism and earned him the respect of sports fans across the UK and beyond. We want to thank him for the contribution he has made.\u201d",
      "\u201cMatch of the Day\u201d \u2014 a late-night program that has been running since the 1960s and is regarded as an institution in Britain \u2014 will be hosted by Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan for the start of the 2025-26 season. None of them are former soccer players.",

      "Work requirements for Medicaid recipients, hospitals checking citizenship status, food assistance cuts and other measures in the budget passed by the U.S. House would rearrange the U.S. social safety net",
      "The U.S. social safety net would be jolted if the budget bill backed by President Donald Trump and passed Thursday by the House of Representatives becomes law.",
      "It would require many low-income adults to work to receive Medicaid health insurance coverage and more to work to get food assistance, require hospitals to verify the citizenship status of patients, and cut funding for services like birth control to the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Supporters of the bill say the moves will save money, root out waste and encourage personal responsibility.",
      "A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "The measure, which also includes tax cuts, passed the House by one vote and could have provisions reworked again as it heads to the Senate.",
      "Here's a look at the potential impact.",
      "Starting next year, many able-bodied Medicaid enrollees will be required to show that they work in exchange for the health insurance coverage.",
      "While about 92% of people enrolled now meet the requirement, roughly 5 million would likely lose their coverage, according to previous estimates of an earlier version of the bill provided by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Increased eligibility checks and red tape related to work requirements may result in some people wrongly getting booted off, said Eduardo Conrado, the president of Ascension, a health care system that operates hospitals across 10 states.",
      "That could spell trouble for rural hospitals, in particular, who will see their small pool of patients go from paying for their emergency care with Medicaid coverage to not paying anything at all. Hospitals could have to eat their costs.",
      "\u201cAdding work requirements is not just a policy change, it\u2019s a shift away from the purpose of the program,\u201d Conrado said of the rule.",
      "Only Arkansas has had a work requirement that kicks people off for noncompliance. More than 18,000 lost coverage after it kicked in in 2018, and the programs was later blocked by federal courts.",
      "Joan Alker, executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Children and Families, said work requirements do not result in more people having jobs \u2014 but in fewer people having health insurance.",
      "\u201cIf you lose your job going forward, good luck to you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a good chance you\u2019re going to be uninsured because of this bill.\u201d",
      "The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, already requires work for some of its roughly 42 million recipients. Adults ages 18-54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents must work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month, or else be limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation passed by the House would raise the work requirement to age 65 and also extend it to parents without children younger than age 7. The bill also would limit the ability to waive work requirements in areas with unemployment rates significantly above the national average.",
      "The combination of those changes could put 6 million adults at risk of losing SNAP benefits, according to the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Like work requirements for Medicaid, those for SNAP tend to cause a decrease in participation without increasing employment, according to an April report by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hamilton Project.",
      "Under the bill, the federal government would punish states that use their own state dollars to provide Medicaid-covered services to immigrants lacking legal status or to provide subsidies to help them buy health insurance.",
      "Some states that provide that sort of coverage extend it only to children.",
      "Those states would see federal funding for the Medicaid expansion population \u2014 typically low-income adults \u2014 drop from 90% to 80%.",
      "That could mean states pull back that Medicaid coverage to avoid the federal penalty.",
      "\u201cIf that penalty of 10% is imposed, we would expect that states will have to drop that coverage,\u201d said Georgetown's Alker.",
      "KFF said the provision could affect 14 states and Washington, D.C., that cover children regardless of their immigration status.",
      "This month the Democratic governor of one of them \u2014 California's Gavin Newsom \u2014 announced a plan to freeze new enrollments in state-funded health care for immigrants who do not have legal status as a budget-balancing measure.",
      "Planned Parenthood says a provision barring it from receiving Medicaid funds could lead to about one-third of its health centers closing.",
      "The group said about 200 centers are at risk \u2014 most of them in states where abortion is legal. In those states, the number of Planned Parenthood centers could be cut in half.",
      "Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, also offers other health services, including birth control and cancer screening.",
      "Federal money was already barred from paying for abortion, but state Medicaid funds in some states now cover it.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a fight for survival \u2014 not just for Planned Parenthood, but for the ability of everyone to get high-quality, non-judgmental health care,\u201d Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson said in a statement.",
      "Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America celebrated the provision, saying \u201cCongress took a big step toward stopping taxpayer funding of the Big Abortion industry.\u201d",
      "Medicaid would stop covering gender-affirming care for people of all ages in 2027 under a provision added in the hours before the bill passed.",
      "Further, coverage of the treatments could not be required on insurance plans sold through the exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "Trump has targeted transgender people, who make up around 1% of the U.S. population, since returning to office, including declaring that the U.S. won\u2019t spend taxpayer money on gender-affirming medical care for transgender people under 19. The care includes puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries.",
      "The bill would expand that to all ages, at least when it comes to Medicaid.",
      "States now have a mix of policies on the issue with some blocking the coverage and others requiring it.",
      "An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll this month found that about half of U.S. adults oppose government funding for the care for those 19 and over.",
      "Olivia Hunt, director of federal policy for Advocates for Trans Equality called gender-affirming care \u201cone of the most cost-effective public health strategies we've ever found.\u201d",

      "Government vaccine advisers are meeting to decide if the recipe for COVID-19 vaccines needs updating for this fall and winter",
      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for shots.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That has big implications for the fall vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "The FDA deflected questions about the new policy at Thursday's meeting to decide whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. The committee\u2019s recommendation is nonbinding guidance ahead of an agency decision.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "With JN.1 descendants still dominating worldwide, Pfizer and Moderna representatives told panelists Thursday that their current vaccines remain effective, although switching to a newer subtype, LP.8.1, could provide even more protection. Novavax said sticking with the parent strain JN.1 \u2014 the company\u2019s current vaccine formula \u2014 might be best.",
      "The challenge for regulators is there's no way to predict how the virus will evolve by the time fall vaccinations begin.",
      "The World Health Organization recently issued guidance that last year's version remained OK but that vaccine-makers could also choose an update. A representative for the organization told FDA panelists that current data on the COVID-19's continuing evolution might not yet warrant switching to a newer subtype. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency recently recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "While demand for vaccinations has dropped, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 30,000 to 50,000 adults have died from COVID-19 since October. The virus continues to cause \u201cenormous burden\u201d on the health care system, CDC\u2019s Dr. Fiona Havers told panelists. Older adults count for most hospitalizations and deaths but COVID-19 also is \u201ca major cause of pediatric hospitalization,\u201d especially in children under 2 -- many of whom had no underlying medical problems before their infections.",
      "The strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The CDC's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "CDC staffers presented real-world data Thursday showing that getting a booster last fall offered added protection even in people who had been infected and previously vaccinated. Company studies reached the same conclusion \u2014 including one by Moderna that compared medical records of about 900,000 people.",

      "A much-anticipated White House report about childhood diseases has provoked a tug-of-war that\u2019s pitted farmers and some prominent Republican lawmakers against health secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- A highly-anticipated White House report about childhood diseases has provoked a tug-of-war pitting farmers and some prominent Republican lawmakers against health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement ahead of its release.",
      "President Donald Trump promised a review within 100 days that would analyze the ramifications that U.S. lifestyle \u2014 from the medications prescribed for children to the food served on their school lunch trays \u2014 has on childhood diseases like obesity, depression or attention deficit disorder. The report, led by a so-called \u201cMAHA Commission,\u201d is expected to be released on Thursday.",
      "Farmers and Republicans are nervous about what the report might say about glyphosate, the ingredient commonly used in pesticides sprayed on crops. Kennedy has denied the report will be unfavorable to farmers.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor on Wednesday, Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley warned that farmers have reached out to him, upset they have not been able to provide input on the MAHA report ahead of its release.",
      "\u201cI hope there is nothing in the MAHA report that jeopardizes the food supply or the livelihood of farmers,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "Last month, a group of 79 Republicans \u2014 including several senators who represent farming states \u2014 echoed similar concerns about the report saying in a letter to Kennedy that without the products agricultural \u201cyields and quantity are negatively impacted.\u201d",
      "Glyphosate has been available for about 50 years and some farmers say it remains essential for controlling weeds without excessive tilling, helping to conserve both soil and fuel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why we still use: It works,\u201d said Blake Hurst, a Missouri farmer who is past president of the Missouri Farm Bureau.",
      "Kennedy, though, has built a sizable following over many decades, in part, because of the lawsuits he's waged against corporations, including the company that produced weedkiller Roundup. The World Health Organization has labeled that product's key ingredient, glyphosate, as a probable carcinogen for humans.",
      "On Wednesday a large group of his supporters sent Kennedy a letter calling on the commission to \u201chold the chemical industry\u201d accountable in the report, noting that pressure is mounting.",
      "\u201cEvidence is piling up and the risks from pesticide exposure are undeniable,\u201d the letter, signed by 360 self-proclaimed MAHA supporters that include farmers, former Kennedy campaign staffers and those who worked with him at his anti-vaccine nonprofit.",
      "Dave Murphy, a fundraiser for Kennedy's failed presidential bid, said that he submitted studies and comments on pesticides to Trump administration officials for inclusion in the MAHA report but said that there's \u201ca lot of pressure within Washington\u201d over what the final report says on the issue.",
      "During a senate hearing on Wednesday, Kennedy rebutted concerns from Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith that the report would \u201cunfairly\u201d target farmers.",
      "\u201cThere's not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer,\u201d Kennedy said of his report. \u201cWe are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\u201d",
      "Kennedy was appearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee to discuss the White House's proposed budget, which would give a $500 million boost for Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative. That same proposal also makes deep cuts, including to infectious disease prevention, maternal health and medical research programs.",
      "In February, Trump signed an executive order establishing a Make America Healthy Again Commission tasked with examining the \u201cthreat\u201d that prescription drugs, chemicals and certain food ingredients pose to children.",
      "That review was supposed to be led by several members of the president's cabinet, including Kennedy, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Kennedy, who has pledged \u201cradical transparency\u201d since taking over the nation's health department, never convened a public meeting of the commission. The White House only released brief, edited clips from a single, closed-door meeting of the commission held in March.",
      "A White House spokesman called the report, which has not been released, a \u201chistoric step,\u201d without sharing further details.",

      "A person attended a Shakira concert at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey while infectious with measles",
      "New Jersey health officials are asking people who went to last week's Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium to monitor for measles symptoms because a person went to see the singer while infectious.",
      "There is no confirmed outbreak in New Jersey, but the U.S. and North America are seeing high measles activity this year \u2014 including hundreds sickened by the highly infectious airborne virus in West Texas \u2014 and declining rates of people getting the vaccine, which is 97% effective after two doses.",
      "Schools and daycares are among the most common places for measles exposures, like one that happened in three western North Dakota public schools in early May that led to all unvaccinated students being held at home for 21 days under state law.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the measles and how to protect yourself.",
      "Most U.S. children get vaccinated against measles before entering public school, but increasing numbers of people skipping shots for religious or personal reasons have fueled outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad this year.",
      "Overall, the U.S. has seen more than 1,000 measles cases across 30 states since the beginning of the year, and 11 states with outbreaks \u2014 defined as three or more related cases. The largest outbreak in the U.S. has been in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. There are also large outbreaks in Mexico and Canada.",
      "It's a respiratory disease caused by one of the world\u2019s most contagious viruses. The virus is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It most commonly affects kids.",
      "\u201cOn average, one infected person may infect about 15 other people,\u201d said Scott Weaver, a center of excellence director for the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. \u201cThere\u2019s only a few viruses that even come close to that.\u201d",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",
      "People who have had measles once can\u2019t get it again, health officials say.",
      "It usually doesn\u2019t kill people, but it can.",
      "Common complications include ear infections and diarrhea. But about 1 in 5 unvaccinated Americans who get measles are hospitalized, the CDC said. Pregnant women who haven\u2019t gotten the vaccine may give birth prematurely or have a low-birthweight baby.",
      "Among children with measles, about 1 in every 20 develops pneumonia, the CDC said, and about one in every 1,000 suffers swelling of the brain called encephalitis \u2014 which can lead to convulsions, deafness or intellectual disability.",
      "\u201cChildren develop the most severe illness,\" said Weaver, who works at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"The cause of death in these kinds of cases is usually pneumonia and complications from pneumonia.\u201d",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cBefore a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, everybody got\u201d measles, Weaver said. There is \u201cgreat data\u201d on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, he said, because it's been around for decades.",
      "\u201cAny of these outbreaks we\u2019re seeing can easily be prevented by increasing the rate of vaccination in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can maintain 95% of people vaccinated, we\u2019re not going to see this happening in the future. And we\u2019ve slipped well below that level in many parts of the country.\u201d",
      "Vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "Not usually. People who are vaccinated are considered protected against measles for their lifetime.",
      "Health care providers can test for antibodies and give boosters if needed.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\u201d",
      "Weaver said people at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.",

      "Emotional well-being",
      "NEW YORK -- Marian Rivman is pushing 80. Harriet Luria is a proud 83. In this trio, Carol Leister is the baby at 62. Together, they have decades of experience with yoga. Only now, it involves a chair.",
      "Chair yoga adapts traditional yoga poses for older people and others with physical challenges, but the three devotees said after a recent class that doesn't mean it's not a quality workout. As older adults have become more active, chair yoga has grown in popularity.",
      "\u201cYou're stretching your whole body,\u201d Rivman offered. \u201cWhat you can do in the chair is a little bit more forgiving on the knees and on the hips. So as you age, it allows you to get into positions that you were doing before without hurting yourself.\u201d",
      "Sitting down to exercise, or standing while holding onto a chair to perform some poses, may not sound like a workout, but Rivman, Luria, Leister and practitioners everywhere see a world of benefits.",
      "\u201cI took it up because I have osteoporosis and the chair yoga is much easier,\u201d Luria said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry as much about falling and breaking anything. It's not as difficult as I thought it would be, but it\u2019s not easy. And you really do use your muscles. It\u2019s an excellent workout.\u201d",
      "Chair yoga is clearly marketed to older women, who made up the class where the three yoga friends got together at the Marlene Meyerson JCC on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. But the practice also has a lot to offer others, said their instructor, Whitney Chapman.",
      "Desk workers can squeeze in 15 minutes of chair yoga, for instance. Many companies offer it as a way to cut down on stress and improve overall health. And people recovering from surgery or injuries may not be ready to get down on a yoga mat, but they can stretch in a chair.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known these ladies probably 18 to 20 years. And the very first time in a yoga class that I brought in the chair, all of my students said I don\u2019t want geriatric yoga. I\u2019m not an old person,\u201d Chapman said.",
      "\u201cAnd then they saw that having a chair is just as good as a yoga strap, a yoga block. It\u2019s another prop that\u2019s going to help you do what you want to do. So it\u2019s not necessarily because you\u2019re older, but that it can be helpful. And it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re geriatric just because you\u2019re sitting in a chair.\u201d",
      "The benefits are many, Chapman said: improved flexibility, strength, balance. And there's the overall emotional well-being that yoga practitioners in general report. It's particularly useful for people with mobility issues or chronic ailments like arthritis or back pain. Chapman also teaches yoga to cancer and Parkinson's disease patients.",
      "In addition to restorative and other benefits, the practice of chair yoga can help improve posture for people of all ages and abilities, and help older people prevent falls.",
      "Leister recently retired.",
      "\u201cI've been looking for all different kinds of exercises to do and this is one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one that I could see doing for the rest of my life, where some that are a little more strenuous I may not be able to do in the future.\u201d",
      "Traditional yoga originated more than 5,000 years ago in India. Many of the poses used today are also that old. It can be as much spiritual as physical, and that also goes for its chair descendant. The precise movements are tied to deliberate, cleansing breathwork.",
      "Rivman has been doing yoga for about 50 years.",
      "\u201cOnce you start and you get what it does for your body, you don\u2019t want to give it up. And if there\u2019s a way that you can keep doing it and keep doing it safely, that\u2019s a choice you\u2019re going to make,\u201d she said.",
      "The practice of yoga, including chair yoga, has been on the rise in the U.S. over the last 20 years. In 2022, the percentage of adults age 18 and older who practiced yoga in the past 12 months was 16.9%, with percentages highest among women ages 18\u201344, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Women are more than twice as likely as men to practice yoga, the data showed. The percentage of adults who practiced yoga to treat or manage pain decreased with increasing family income.",

      "Some studies have shown that children with autism are more at risk of drowning",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In an airy indoor pool with fish cutouts on the walls, a group of small children bobbed, floated and tentatively flutter-kicked.",
      "It was what it looked like, a starter swimming class. But here, instructors worked one-on-one or even two to a child. Some held cards to help kids communicate with teachers by pointing instead of speaking. No one blew whistles.",
      "All the students in the class at the Small Fish Big Fish swim school had autism, a developmental disorder linked to a higher-than-average danger of drowning.",
      "It has long worried autism experts and parents, but recent data make the stakes starkly clear. In Florida, a state where water abounds from beaches to backyards, over 100 children who had autism or were being evaluated for it have drowned since the start of 2021, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County.",
      "The numbers highlight an oft-overlooked dilemma: Autism makes swimming instruction all the more necessary but, often, all the more difficult to get.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing for kids with autism,\u201d said Lovely Chrisostome, who was terrified this winter when her 6-year-old son slipped out of the family\u2019s home and wandered through their lake-dotted neighborhood. She\u2019d once tried enrolling him in swim classes at a public pool, but he had refused to go in.",
      "But her son was in the pool at the autism-specific class at Small Fish Big Fish. An instructor helped him float on his back. When he started showing discomfort \u2013 he doesn\u2019t like to get his head wet \u2013 she eased him onto his side, where he seemed content.",
      "Autism affects an estimated 1 in 31 U.S. children. Their water safety has gotten occasional public attention after tragedies such as the death of Avonte Oquendo, an autistic teen who was found in a New York river in 2014 after disappearing from his school.",
      "While academic research on the issue is limited, a pair of 2017 studies documented a substantially heightened risk of drowning among people with autism spectrum disorder. The risk stems in large part from their propensity to wander off and to underappreciate perils, according to co-author Dr. Guohua Li and other experts.",
      "One Florida 5-year-old apparently wriggled out a doggy door and got into his grandmother\u2019s pool. Another died in a canal after slipping through a fence hole at a playground specifically intended for autistic kids. A 6-year-old drowned in a lake after she evidently climbed a bookshelf positioned to block an apartment door, according to the Children\u2019s Services Council of Palm Beach County. It\u2019s now building a national database.",
      "\u201cSwimming lessons should be a first-line treatment for autism,\u201d said Li, a Columbia University epidemiology professor who isn't involved in the council's research. Li himself has a son with the condition.",
      "Some autistic people excel at swimming, such as the New Jersey teens featured in the 2017 documentary \u201cSwim Team.\" Many others are adept in water. Even some profoundly autistic children can master survival basics with as little as eight hours of aquatic occupational therapy, said Michele Alaniz, a practitioner who published research based on her work at Casa Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare in Pomona, California.",
      "But some families don't sign up for classes, fearing they'll overwhelm children who might have symptoms ranging from not speaking to repeatedly banging their heads to becoming distressed by noise. Other youngsters get kicked out of programs that can\u2019t handle them. Private sessions can be helpful, but pricey.",
      "\u201cHaving somebody that understands a child on the spectrum \u2014 what the special needs are, how to communicate with a child, how to also mitigate a meltdown, particularly in a pool \u2014 is so vital,\u201d says Lindsey Corey. She said her 5-year-old son didn't absorb much from a general swim class or from private lessons at home in Lake Worth, Florida, but made progress in a program with instructors trained by the Autism Society.",
      "As drowning risks have come into focus, advocates are trying to make swimming lessons more accessible. An Australian charity called Autism Swim says 1,400 swim teachers, physical therapists and others worldwide have taken its online training since 2016.",
      "In Florida, the Children's Services Council's of Palm Beach County provided $17,000 last year for the Autism Society of America to train dozens of instructors, said Jon Burstein, who did the council's research on autism and drowning. The organization paid another $13,500 for the classes at Small Fish Big Fish.",
      "The dozen students, ranging from about 4 to 8, attend a nearby autism-specific charter school. They initially were reluctant to get in the bus, let alone in the water, organizers said. But on an early April afternoon, they readily headed for the shallow pool.",
      "One girl floated on a foam board with her face in the water, an exercise in breath control. Another girl grinned as she propelled herself on a foam noodle.",
      "\u201cShe's fearless to the point it's scary because she'll just jump into a pool, whether she can swim or not,\u201d her mother, Jana D'Agostino, said later. \u201cSo this is really important. It's saving their lives.\u201d",
      "Across the pool, a boy reluctantly eased himself from the steps into the water, where Small Fish founder Melissa Taylor waited for him. \u201cMy turn!\u201d she said, and dunked her head in the water.",
      "He did likewise, then retreated to the steps. Taylor continued working with him, but he soon backed out of the pool and began making hand movements. Realizing he'd had enough, instructors let him towel off.",
      "\u201cIt's taking a lot to get him to trust us,\u201d explained Taylor. But she also recognizes when repetitive splashing and movement signal excitement, not alarm.",
      "The session continued for the other children, including Chrisostome's son, who emerged with a smile.",

      "Federal health officials will no longer routinely approve annual COVID-19 shots for younger adults and children who are healthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Annual COVID-19 shots for healthy younger adults and children will no longer be routinely approved under a major new policy shift unveiled Tuesday by the Trump administration.",
      "Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new requirements for access to yearly COVID shots, saying they'd continue to use a streamlined approach that would continue offering them to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one health problem that puts them at higher risk.",
      "But the FDA framework urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. In a framework published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, agency officials said the approach still could keep annual vaccinations available for between 100 million and 200 million people.",
      "The upcoming changes raise questions for people who may still want a fall COVID-19 shot but don't clearly fit into one of the categories.",
      "\u201cIs the pharmacist going to determine if you're in a high-risk group?\u201d asked Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cThe only thing that can come of this will make vaccines less insurable and less available.\u201d",
      "The framework is the culmination of a series of recent stepsscrutinizing the use of COVID shots and raising major questions about the broader availability of vaccines under President Donald Trump. It was released two days ahead of the first meeting of FDA\u2019s outside vaccine experts under the Trump administration.",
      "Last week the FDA granted full approval of Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine but with major restrictions on who can get it \u2014 and Tuesday's guidance mirrors those restrictions. The approval came after Trump appointees overruled FDA scientists' earlier plans to approve the shot without restrictions.",
      "Pfizer and Moderna, which make the most widely used COVID-19 vaccines, didn't immediately comment.",
      "For years, federal health officials have told most Americans to expect annual updates to COVID-19 vaccines, similar to the annual flu shot. Just like with flu vaccines, until now the FDA has approved updated COVID shots when manufacturers provide evidence that they spark just as much immune protection as the previous year's version.",
      "But FDA's new guidance appears to be the end of that approach under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has filled the FDA and other health agencies with outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID shots, particularly their recommendation for young, healthy adults and children. Under federal procedures, the FDA releases new guidance in draft form and allows the public to comment before finalizing its plans. The publication of Tuesday's policy in a medical journal is highly unusual and could run afoul of federal procedures, according to FDA experts.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s update, written by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and FDA vaccine chief Vinay Prasad, criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach and states that the U.S. has been \u201cthe most aggressive\u201d in recommending COVID boosters, when compared with European countries.",
      "\u201cWe simply don\u2019t know whether a healthy 52-year-old woman with a normal BMI who has had Covid-19 three times and has received six previous doses of a Covid-19 vaccine will benefit from the seventh dose,\u201d they wrote.",
      "Makary and Prasad recommended that companies study people not deemed at high risk for six months, randomly assigning them to get a vaccine or a placebo and tracking outcomes with special attention to severe disease, hospitalization or death.",
      "Experts say there are legitimate questions about how much everyone still benefits from yearly COVID vaccination or whether they should be recommended for people at increased risk.",
      "An influential panel of advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to debate which vaccines should be recommended to which groups.",
      "The FDA's announcement appears to usurp that advisory panel's job, Offit said. He added that CDC studies have made clear that booster doses do offer protection against mild to moderate illness for four to six months after the shot even in healthy people.",

      "The announcement that Joe Biden has prostate cancer is the latest example of how the final chapters of his political career have been shaped by the disease",
      "WASHINGTON -- In Joe Biden\u2019s family, there\u2019s a saying that the three worst words anyone can hear are \u201cyou have cancer.\u201d",
      "One decade ago, his son Beau died from a brain tumor. Several years later, his wife Jill had two cancerous lesions removed in her own brush with the disease.",
      "Now it is the former president\u2019s turn. Biden\u2019s office disclosed his prostate cancer diagnosis over the weekend, saying it has already spread to his bones.",
      "Although the cancer can possibly be controlled with treatment, it is no longer curable. The announcement is a bitter revelation that a disease that has brought so much tragedy to Biden\u2019s life could be what ends it.",
      "\u201cCancer touches us all,\u201d Biden wrote on social media. \u201cLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places.\u201d",
      "Even before the diagnosis, Biden's post-presidency was shadowed by questions about his health and whether he should have run for reelection. As questions about his fitness for office mounted, he abandoned the campaign and Donald Trump retook the presidency by defeating Kamala Harris. As the 82-year-old Biden works to safeguard his damaged political legacy, he'll also be fighting a disease that shaped the final chapters of his decades-long career.",
      "Biden was serving as Barack Obama's vice president when Beau died in 2015. He decided not to seek the Democratic nomination the following year, which helped clear a path for Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump in 2016.",
      "Valerie Jarrett, a longtime Obama adviser, said Biden wanted to \u201cchannel his grief into action and figure out how we can do better\u201d on treating cancer to \"make sure that other people didn\u2019t have to go through what he went through.\u201d",
      "The effort was formalized as a White House task force, with Biden in charge. After a few years out of office, Biden re-entered politics to campaign against Trump in 2020. The heartache from Beau's death was never far from the surface though. His eldest son had been Delaware's attorney general and often viewed as Biden's political successor.",
      "\u201cBeau should be the one running for president, not me,\u201d Biden said, a thought he echoed on many occasions.",
      "He made fighting cancer a focus for his presidency, resurrecting a \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative to increase funding for research and improve treatment. He unveiled the initiative at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in 2022, echoing the Democratic icon's famous speech declaring that \u201cwe will go to the moon\u201d six decades earlier.",
      "\"Beating cancer is something we can do together,\" Biden said.",
      "By this point, he had already signed legislation known as the PACT Act to expand healthcare benefits for veterans. The law guarantees treatment for chronic illnesses blamed on burn pits, which were used to dispose of chemicals, tires, plastics, medical equipment and human waste on military bases.",
      "Biden left no doubt that he believed Beau\u2019s death resulted from his service with the National Guard in Iraq.",
      "\u201cWhen they came home, many of the fittest and best warriors that we sent to war were not the same \u2014 headaches, numbness, dizziness, cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son Beau was one of them.\u201d",
      "Denis McDonough, who led the Veterans Affairs Department under Biden, said the president didn't talk about Beau's death during policy discussions. But he said it was clear that Biden \u201cknew the experience that other families were having, and he was going to be damn sure that we weren\u2019t going to miss an opportunity to address that.\u201d",
      "McDonough recalled that Biden wanted the new law to take effect as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cHe had an option to stretch it out,\" he said. \"He said no way.\u201d",
      "The following year, first lady Jill Biden had two cancerous lesions removed, one above her right eye and the other on her chest. They were both basal cell carcinoma.",
      "Learning of the diagnosis \u201cwas a little harder than I thought,\u201d she told The Associated Press during a trip to Africa.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\" she said. \"Believe me, I am so lucky that they caught it, they removed it, and I\u2019m healthy.\u201d",
      "Biden's cancer diagnosis is not the first time that he's faced his own mortality.",
      "Months after ending his first presidential campaign in 1988, he collapsed in a New York hotel room. In his memoir \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d he described \u201clightning flashing inside my head, a powerful electrical surge \u2014 and then a rip of pain like I\u2019d never felt before.\u201d",
      "He had suffered a brain aneurysm that required surgery. Biden wrote that \u201cI had no real fear of dying. I\u2019d long since accepted the fact that life\u2019s guarantees don\u2019t include a fair shake.\u201d",
      "McDonough imagined that Biden would feel similarly about his current situation.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s always on to the next fight,\u201d he said.",

      "GENEVA -- The World Health Organization on Monday opened its annual meeting of government ministers and other top envoys facing one of the most serious crises of its 77-year history in the wake of Trump administration funding cuts and plans to withdraw the United States.",
      "The U.N. health agency this year has seen a plunge in its ability to carry out its sweeping mandate to do everything from recommend reductions in sugar levels in soft drinks to head the global response to pandemics like COVID-19 or outbreaks like polio or Ebola.",

      "Member countries are expected to agree to raise annual dues, known as \u201cassessed contributions,\u201d by 20% to support WHO finances and reduce dependency on governments\u2019 voluntary contributions \u2014 which change each year and make up over half of the budget.",
      "They are also expected to agree to a hard-wrought \u201c pandemic treaty \u201d that was born of a desire to avoid any replay of the patchy, unequal response to COVID-19 when the next \u2014 and inevitable, most experts say \u2014 pandemic hits.",
      "Among other things, the treaty would guarantee that countries that share critical samples of viruses will receive any resulting tests, medicines and vaccines and give WHO up to 20% of such products to make sure poorer countries can have access to them.",
      "Tedros calls the treaty \u201ctruly historic\u201d and said it \u201ccan make the world safer\u201d by boosting collaboration to prepare for, prevent and respond to pandemics.",
      "The treaty\u2019s effectiveness will face doubts when the U.S. \u2014 which poured billions into speedy work by pharmaceutical companies to develop COVID-19 vaccines \u2014 is sitting out, and because countries face no penalties if they ignore it, a common issue in international law.",
      "Kavanagh said passage of the treaty \u201ccould be a significant victory \u2014 evidence that the U.S. government may no longer be indispensable in global health\u201d and could offer an opportunity for developing nations in the \u201cglobal South\u201d over the longer term.",
      "In the run-up to the assembly, WHO has been cleaning house and cutting costs. Its management has presented a budget for the next two years at just under $4.3 billion, which is 22% less than originally planned \u2014 largely in response to Western funding cuts.",
      "At a meeting on its budget last week, Tedros \u2014 a former Ethiopian health and foreign minister \u2013 announced a shake-up of top management that included the exit of key adviser Dr. Michael Ryan from the job as emergencies chief.",

      "Attention spans are shrinking, with research showing the average person's has declined from 2.5 minutes in 2004 to 47 seconds now",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Feel like you can't focus? Like you'll never finish a book again? Like the only way to keep your mind and hands busy is to scroll on social media for hours?",
      "You're far from alone. One body of decades-long research found the average person's attention span for a single screen is 47 seconds, down from 2.5 minutes in 2004. The 24/7 news cycle, uncertainty about the state of the world and countless hours of screen time don\u2019t help, experts say.",
      "\u201cWhen my patients talk to me about this stuff there is often a feeling of helplessness or powerlessness,\u201d said Dr. Michael Ziffra, a psychiatrist at Northwestern Medicine. \u201cBut you can change these behaviors. You can improve your attention span.\u201d",
      "Here are ways to start that process. As you read, challenge yourself to set a 2.5 minute timer and stay on this article without looking at another device or clicking away.",
      "A shifting attention is an evolutionary feature, not a bug. Our brains are hardwired to quickly filter information and hone in on potential threats or changes in what's happening around us.",
      "What's grabbing our attentions has changed. For our ancestors, it might have been a rustle in the bushes putting us on guard for a lurking tiger. Today, it could be a rash of breaking news alerts and phone notifications.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic warped many people's sense of time and increased their screen usage like never before, said Stacey Nye, a clinical psychologist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.",
      "Technology isn't the only thing that influences our attention, experts say, but the effects of those pinging notifications or hours scrolling through 30-second long videos can build up over time.",
      "\u201cOur attention span has really been trained to only focus in those little, small blips and it interrupts our natural focus cycles,\u201d she said.",
      "Experts say \u201cactive\u201d breaks are among the best way to retrain your mind and your attention. They only take about 30 minutes, Nye said, and can be as simple as taking a walk while noticing things around you or moving to another room for lunch.",
      "Don't be afraid to get creative. Develop a list of alternative activities or randomly choose ideas out of a fish bowl. Try craft projects, a short meditation, fixing a quick meal or talking a walk outside. All the better if you can involve a friend as well.",
      "The break needs to be a physical or mental activity \u2014 no passive phone-scrolling.",
      "When the brain is understimulated and looking for change, it\u2019ll usually grab onto the first thing it sees. The smartphone, an \u201cever-producing change machine,\u201d is an enticing option, said Cindy Lustig, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Michigan.",
      "Turn off unnecessary notifications and put that \u201cdo not disturb\u201d mode to good use, especially before bedtime. Better yet, put your phone in a whole different room, Lustig said.",
      "Multitasking may make you feel like you're getting more done, but brain experts recommend against it.",
      "\u201cBe a single tasker,\" Nye said. \u201cWork on one thing at a time, for a specified period of time and begin to work your way up.\u201d",
      "Lustig is a big fan of the \u201cPomodoro technique,\" in which you set a timer and work on something for 25 or 30 minutes before taking a five-minute break.",
      "She tells herself: \u201cI can do anything for this amount of time,\" and the world will still be waiting for her at the end.",
      "It's not enough to just have a hobby, Lustig said. It helps to choose hobbies that include deliberate practice and a goal to strive toward, whether it's playing guitar for an audience or improving in a sport.",
      "It helps to pick something that you enjoy as well.",
      "\u201cYou don't want to start with the heavy nonfiction or like \u2018War and Peace,\u2019\u201d Lustig said. \u201cIf you need to start with the romance novel, then start with the romance novel. You can work your way up.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also important to be kind to yourself. Everyone has good and bad days, and attention needs are different \u2014 and even vary from task to task.",
      "The key is to make an intentional effort, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is in many ways similar to a muscle in the sense that we can build it up with practice and exercises,\u201d Ziffra said. \u201cConversely, it can weaken if we\u2019re not exercising it.\u201d",

      "Health officials are urging vigilance as reports of bird flu cases in humans appear to have stopped",
      "Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped.",
      "Has the search for cases been weakened by government cuts? Are immigrant farm workers, who have accounted for many of the U.S. cases, more afraid to come forward for testing amid the Trump administration's deportation push? Is it just a natural ebb in infections?",
      "\u201cWe just don't know why there haven't been cases,\u201d said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \u201cI think we should assume there are infections that are occurring in farmworkers that just aren't being detected.\u201d",
      "The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S.",
      "In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. \u2014 most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms. One person died, but most of the infected people had mild illnesses.",
      "The most recent infections confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were in early February in Nevada, Ohio and Wyoming.",
      "California had been a hotspot, with three-quarters of the nation\u2019s infections in dairy cattle. But testing and cases among people have fallen off. At least 50 people were tested each month in late 2024, but just three people were tested in March, one in April and none in May so far, state records show. Overall, the state has confirmed H5N1 infections in 38 people, none after Jan. 14.",
      "During a call with U.S. doctors this month, one CDC official noted that there is a seasonality to bird flu: Cases peak in the fall and early winter, possibly due to the migration patterns of wild birds that are primary spreaders of the virus.",
      "That could mean the U.S. is experiencing a natural \u2014 maybe temporary \u2014 decline in cases.",
      "It's unlikely that a severe human infection, requiring hospitalization, would go unnoticed, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases.",
      "What's more, a patchwork system that monitors viruses in sewage and wastewater has suggested limited activity recently.",
      "New infections are still being detected in birds and cattle, but not as frequently as several months ago.",
      "\u201cGiven the fact that the number of animal detections has fallen according to USDA data, it\u2019s not surprising that human cases have declined as well,\u201d the CDC said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Gregory Gray said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the CDC not identifying new cases in months.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody\u2019s hiding anything,\u201d said Gray, an infectious disease speicialist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "But Osterholm and some other experts think it's likely that at least some milder infections are going undetected. And they worry that the effort to find them has been eroding.",
      "Resignations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine could slow the government\u2019s bird flu monitoring, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
      "Three of 14 experts accepted deferred resignation offers at the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which responds to disease outbreaks with crucial diagnostic information, he said. They are among more than 15,000 USDA staff to accept the offers, an agency spokesperson said.",
      "And dozens of staff were fired at the FDA's Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, which investigates animal diseases caused by problems including contaminated pet food. Cats in several states have been sickened and died after eating raw pet food found to contain poultry infected with H5N1.",
      "Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said \"targeted surveillance has really dropped off precipitously since Trump took office.\"",
      "She wonders if immigrant farmworkers are too scared to come forward.",
      "\"I can\u2019t argue with anyone who would be risking getting shipped to a Salvadoran gulag for reporting an exposure or seeking testing,\u201d she said.",
      "The CDC characterizes the risk to the general public as low, although it is higher for people who work with cattle and poultry or who are in contact with wild birds.",
      "Earlier this month, an agency assessment said there is a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d that currently circulating strains of bird flu could cause a future pandemic, but the CDC stressed that other emerging forms of bird flu has been similarly labeled in the past.",
      "Still, research is continuing.",
      "Texas A&M University scientists have collected blood samples from dairy workers in multiple states to test for signs of past H5N1 exposure, said David Douphrate, a workplace health and safety expert leading the project. The yearlong study is funded by a nearly $4 million grant from the CDC and is expected to conclude in July.",
      "Douphrate said he leveraged two decades of relationships with dairy producers and workers to gain access to the farms.",
      "\u201cWe have had very good participation,\u201d Douphrate said. \u201cThey have been very willing.\u201d",
      "Similar surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d among domestic cats, said Kristen Coleman, a researcher at the University of Maryland at College Park who studies emerging animal diseases. She recently released a paper reviewing bird flu in infections in cats between 2004 and 2024.",
      "Barn cats that died after drinking raw milk were one of the first signs that dairy cows were becoming infected with bird flu in 2024. Since then, the Agriculture Department has confirmed more than 120 domestic cats infected with the virus across the U.S.",
      "Infections have mostly been found in cats that died. Less is known about milder infections, whether cats can recover from bird flu \u2014 or whether the virus can spill over into people.",
      "Coleman has been collecting blood samples from cats across the U.S. to see if they have evidence of previous exposure to the virus. But the process is slow and research funding is uncertain.",
      "\u201cIt's easy to downplay something because that's usually what humans do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what we really need to be doing is ramping up.\u201d",

    "summary": "The British government will roll out the use of medication to suppress the sex drive of sex offenders",
    "story": [
      "The British government will roll out the use of medication to suppress the sex drive of sex offenders",
      "LONDON -- The British government is to rollout the use of medication to suppress the sex drive of sex offenders, as part of a package of measures to reduce the risk of reoffending and alleviate the pressures on the prison system, which is running out of space.",
      "In a statement to Parliament Thursday following the release of an independent sentencing review, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said so-called chemical castration would be used in 20 prisons in two regions.",
      "\u201cAnd I am exploring whether mandating the approach is possible,\" she said. \u201cOf course, it is vital that this approach is taken alongside psychological interventions that target other causes of offending, like asserting power and control.\u201d",
      "Though the review highlighted the treatment would not be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation, Mahmood said studies show that chemical castration can lead to a 60% reduction in reoffending.",
      "It's been used in Germany and Denmark on a voluntary basis, and in Poland as mandatory for some offenders.",
      "The recommendation was part of a wide-ranging review led by former justice secretary, David Gauke. As well as looking at ways to cut reoffending, Gauke recommended reforms to overhaul the prisons system, which is running at near-capacity.",
      "One of the first things Mahmood did as justice minister after Labour returned to power after 14 years last July was sanction an early-release program for prisoners to free up space. She says she doesn't want to do that again and set up the review and appointed a Conservative predecessor to oversee it.",
      "The review recommended that criminals could be released from prison earlier than currently, while judges could be given more flexibility to impose punishments such as driving bans. It also recommended that sentences of less than 12 months would also be scrapped, apart from exceptional circumstances such as domestic abuse cases.",
      "It also called for the immediate deportation for foreign nationals handed a three-year sentence or less.",
      "The review called for higher investment in the probation service to allow officers to spend more time with offenders for their rehabilitation and extra funding for the tens of thousands more offenders being electronically tagged in the community.",
      "Mahmood responded by giving a 700 million-pound ($930 million) a year for probation within years.",
      "\u201cIf the government doesn\u2019t put the resources into probation that is necessary, then the risk here is that we won\u2019t make progress on rehabilitation that we need, and there will be a public backlash against it,\" Gauke said.",
      "The prison population in England and Wales has doubled over the past 30 years or so to nearly 90,000. That's despite a fall in crime rates and is driven in part by the fact that longer sentences are being handed out amid pressure to be tough on crime.",
      "Robert Jenrick, the justice spokesman for the Conservatives, was clear in his opposition to the proposals and warned that scrapping short sentences would be effectively \u201cdecriminalizing\u201d offenses like burglary, theft and assault. And tags, he said, are as useful as \u201csmoke alarms putting out bonfires\u201d when it comes to stopping reoffending.",
      "Alongside accepting any changes, the government has said it will embark on a big prison building program, partly to replace some that have been used since Victorian times in the late 19th century.",

      "ROME -- Italy\u2019s Constitutional Court on Thursday ruled that two women can register as parents of a child on a birth certificate, saying recognition of parental rights cannot be restricted to the biological mother in families with same-sex parents.",
      "Advocates for LGBTQ+ rejoiced at the ruling, while the association Pro Life and Family denounced it as sending thousands of children born to same-sex parents into \u201can existential joke.\u201d",
      "The court ruled that it was unconstitutional for city registers to deprive children born to same sex-parents of recognition by both the biological mother and the woman who consented to the medically assisted pregnancy and assumed parental responsibilities.",
      "In recent years, some city registrars had begun to record only the name of the biological mother on birth certificates, and not the name of her partner. In order to have legal rights and responsibility over the child, the non-biological mother then had to \u201cadopt\u201d the child.",
      "A 2004 law had provided for such limited parental recognition. But thanks to an Interior Ministry circular in 2023, the restrictions were being enforced anew as part of the policy of the far-right-led government of Premier Giorgia Meloni to crack down on surrogacy and promote traditional family values.",
      "The ruling does not address the legality of medically assisted procreation: Italy has strong restrictions on IVF and has had a ban on surrogacy since 2004. Last year Italy expanded the ban to criminalize Italians who go abroad to have children through surrogacy.",

      "A Kremlin spokesman says Russia and Ukraine have scheduled no further direct talks on ending their more than three-year war",
      "Russia and Ukraine have scheduled no further direct talks on ending their more than three-year war, a Kremlin spokesman said Thursday, almost a week after the first face-to-face engagement between the countries\u2019 delegations since 2022 and days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced they would start ceasefire negotiations \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no concrete agreement about the next meetings,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \u201cThey are yet to be agreed upon.\u201d",
      "During two hours of talks in Istanbul last Friday, Kyiv and Moscow agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war each, in what would be their biggest such swap. Apart from that step, the meeting delivered no significant breakthrough.",
      "Several months of intensified U.S. and European pressure on the two sides to accept a ceasefire and negotiate a settlement have yielded little progress. Meanwhile, Russia is readying a summer offensive to capture more Ukrainian land, Ukrainian government and military analysts say.",
      "Putin said earlier this week that Moscow would \u201cpropose and is ready to work with\u201d Ukraine on a \u201cmemorandum\u201d outlining the framework for \u201ca possible future peace treaty.\u201d Putin has effectively rejected a 30-day ceasefire proposal that Ukraine has accepted. He has linked the possibility to a halt in Ukraine's mobilization effort and a freeze on Western arms shipments to Kyiv as part of a comprehensive settlement.",
      "The major prisoner swap is a \u201cquite laborious process\u201d that \u201crequires some time,\u201d Peskov said.",
      "But he added: \u201cThe work is continuing at a quick pace, everybody is interested in doing it quickly.\u201d",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that preparations are underway for the potential prisoner exchange, which he described as \u201cperhaps the only real result\u201d of the talks in Turkey.",

      "\u201cWe know what Trump told Putin, we don\u2019t know what Trump told the Europeans. We know President Trump\u2019s official statement,\u201d Peskov said. \u201cWhat we know contrasts with what was written in the article you mentioned.\u201d",
      "Apart from the continuing war of attrition along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, which has killed tens of thousands of troops on both sides, the warring parties have been firing dozens of long-range drones at each other\u2019s territory almost daily.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that it had shot down 105 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 35 over the Moscow region. It was the second straight night that Kyiv\u2019s forces have targeted the Russian capital.",
      "More than 160 flights were delayed across three of Moscow\u2019s four main airports, the city\u2019s transport prosecutor said, as officials grounded planes citing concerns for passenger safety.",
      "The attack prompted some regions to turn off mobile internet signals, including the Oryol region southwest of Moscow, which was targeted heavily on Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, the Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 128 drones at Ukraine overnight.",
      "Among the targets were Ukraine\u2019s central Dnipropetrovsk region, damaging an industrial facility, power lines, and several private homes, regional governor Serhii Lysak said on Telegram.",
      "In Kyiv, debris from a Russian drone fell onto the grounds of a school in the capital\u2019s Darnytskyi district, according to the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, Tymur Tkachenko. No injuries were reported.",

      "The two countries reached an initial agreement in October, but it was put on hold after Britain said it had to wait for the approval of U.S. President Donald Trump. The deal also became stuck after a change of government in Mauritius, amid quarrels over how much money the U.K. should pay for the lease of Diego Garcia. The U.S. pays Britain an unspecified amount to operate the base.",

      "The remote chain of more than 60 islands is located in the middle of the Indian Ocean off the tip of India, south of the Maldives.",
      "The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814, when they were ceded by France.",
      "The archipelago is best known for the military base on Diego Garcia, which has supported U.S. military operations from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the U.S. acknowledged it also had been used for clandestine rendition flights of terror suspects.",
      "Britain split the Chagos Islands away from Mauritius, a former British colony, in 1965, three years before Mauritius gained independence, and called the Chagos archipelago the British Indian Ocean Territory.",
      "In the 1960s and 1970s Britain evicted as many as 2,000 people from the islands so the U.S. military could build the Diego Garcia base.",
      "The U.S. has described the base, which is home to about 2,500 mostly American personnel, as \u201can all but indispensable platform\u201d for security operations in the Middle East, South Asia and East Africa.",

The United Nations and the International Court of Justice have both urged Britain to end its \u201ccolonial administration\u201d of the islands and transfer their sovereignty to Mauritius.",
      "In October Britain's government announced that it was finalizing details of a treaty to hand sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, with the exception of Diego Garcia, which will remain under British control for at least 99 years.",
      "The deal was hailed by then-U.S. President Joe Biden as a \u201chistoric agreement\u201d that secured the future of the Diego Garcia base.

Last year the now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said it posed \u201ca serious threat\u201d to U.S. national security.",

      "Meanwhile voters in Mauritius ousted the government that made the deal, and new Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam backed away from it, citing financial concerns.",

      "Chagossians say they were left out of the political negotiations, which have left them unclear on whether they and their descendants could ever be allowed to return to their homeland.",

      "A top Romanian court has validated the results of Romania\u2019s presidential election rerun, shortly after rejecting a request to annul the results by the hard-right candidate who decisively lost the race to his pro-European Union opponent",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- A top Romanian court on Thursday validated the results of Romania\u2019s presidential election rerun, shortly after rejecting a request to annul the results by the hard-right candidate who decisively lost the race to his pro-European Union opponent.",
      "After deliberations on Thursday, Romania\u2019s Constitutional Court unanimously rejected the annulment request, filed on Tuesday by George Simion, in which he alleged that foreign interference and coordinated manipulation affected the vote.",
      "The Court then validated the results and held a short ceremony attended by the elected President Nicusor Dan, the Bucharest mayor who won the tense runoff, beating Simion with 53.6% of the vote, a margin of more than 829,000 votes.",
      "\u201cI want to thank the Romanian people who turned out in great numbers for the May elections and, in doing so, gave legitimacy to the new president,\u201d 55-year-old Dan, a mathematician and former civic activist, said at the court during the ceremony.",
      "\u201cA new chapter is beginning in Romania\u2019s recent and contemporary history. I want to assure Romanian citizens that I understand the responsibility of the mandate they have entrusted to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be many challenges, and I hope that we will successfully overcome all of them.\u201d",
      "Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, had conceded defeat after losing in the runoff to Dan, but later contested the results. The court said its decision on Thursday is final.",
      "In his request to annul the election, Simion claimed he had \u201cirrefutable evidence\u201d that France, Moldova and \u201cother actors\u201d meddled in the ballot, but did not present any evidence. He also alleged that \u201cdeceased people\u201d had participated in the vote, and that he requested it be canceled on the same grounds as the court\u2019s decision last year.",
      "After the court rejected his annulment request, Simion said in a post on Facebook that the Court \u201chas continued the coup!\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have no choice but to fight!,\u201d his post read. \u201cI call on you to stand with me, today and in the coming weeks!\u201d",
      "Sunday\u2019s tense vote was held months after the same court voided the previous election in which the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu led the first round, following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied.",
      "The Court's unprecedented decision last year to cancel the election plunged EU and NATO member Romania into its worst political crisis in decades, compounded by a string of crises such as the war in neighboring Ukraine and a significant budget deficit.",
      "Dan is expected to be officially sworn in next week, after which he must also contend with deep societal divisions laid bare by the vote, revealing a country where endemic corruption, inequality and an erosion of trust in traditional institutions and parties have fueled a broad rejection of the political establishment.",
      "\"Romanian society has shown wisdom, and I am convinced that in the period ahead, it will continue to push for the positive change that Romania needs,\u201d Dan added Thursday. \"I will fight for the strengthening of state institutions ... I will also fight for the country\u2019s economic prosperity, I will be a partner to the business environment, and I will be a guarantor of civil liberties.\"",
      "Dan will also face the challenge of nominating a prime minister who can garner the support necessary to form a government \u2014 a tall order in a country where strong anti-establishment sentiment led to the emergence of figures like Georgescu and Simion.",
      "Simion capitalized on the furor over last year's annulment and, after coming fourth in the canceled race, allied with Georgescu, who was banned in March from running in the election redo. In the first-round vote on May 4 in the rerun, Simion won a landslide in a field of 11 candidates to enter the runoff.",
      "Hours after voting opened on Friday for Romanians abroad, Simion accused the government of neighboring Moldova of election fraud, which both Moldovan and Romanian authorities rejected.",
      "In comment to The Associated Press on Sunday, he reiterated claims that people were being illegally transported to voting stations in Moldova, allegedly affecting 80,000 votes.",
      "More than half a million Moldovans hold Romanian citizenship, and about 158,000 people voted at polling stations set up in Moldova in the second round. Many more dual citizens would also have cast ballots in other countries.",
      "As a member of the EU and one of the easternmost members of the NATO military alliance, Romania plays a pivotal role in Western security infrastructure \u2014 especially since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of neighboring Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Many observers saw Sunday\u2019s vote as crucial to maintaining Romania\u2019s place within the network of Western alliances \u2014 especially amid fears that the Trump administration is reconsidering its security commitments to the United States\u2019 European partners.",

      "There are hardly any tourists in scenic Himalayan region of Kashmir",
      "SRINAGAR, India -- There are hardly any tourists in the scenic Himalayan region of Kashmir. Most of the hotels and ornate pinewood houseboats are empty. Resorts in the snowclad mountains have fallen silent. Hundreds of cabs are parked and idle.",
      "It\u2019s the fallout of last month\u2019s gun massacre that left 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, dead in Indian-controlled Kashmir followed by tit-for-tat military strikes by India and Pakistan, bringing the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of their third war over the region.",
      "\u201cThere might be some tourist arrivals, but it counts almost negligible. It is almost a zero footfall right now,\u201d said Yaseen Tuman, who operates multiple houseboats in the region\u2019s main city of Srinagar. \u201cThere is a haunting silence now.\u201d",
      "Tens of thousands of panicked tourists left Kashmir within days after the rare killings of tourists on April 22 at a picture-perfect meadow in southern resort town of Pahalgam. Following the attack, authorities temporarily closed dozens of tourist resorts in the region, adding to fear and causing occupancy rates to plummet.",
      "Graphic images, repeatedly circulated through TV channels and social media, deepened panic and anger. India blamed Pakistan for supporting the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied.",
      "Those who had stayed put fled soon after tensions between India and Pakistan spiked. As the two countries fired missiles and drones at each other, the region witnessed mass cancellations of tourist bookings. New Delhi and Islamabad reached a U.S.-mediated ceasefire on May 10 but hardly any new bookings have come in, tour operators said.",
      "Sheikh Bashir Ahmed, vice president of the Kashmir Hotel and Restaurant Association, said at least 12,000 rooms in the region\u2019s hundreds of hotels and guesthouses were previously booked until June. Almost all bookings have been cancelled, and tens of thousands of people associated with hotels are without jobs, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss.\u201d Ahmed said.",
      "The decline has had a ripple effect on the local economy. Handicrafts, food stalls and taxi operators have lost most of their business.",
      "Idyllic destinations, like the resort towns of Gulmarg and Pahalgam, once a magnet for travelers, are eerily silent. Lines of colorful hand-carved boats, known as shikaras, lie deserted, mostly anchored still on Srinagar\u2019s normally bustling Dal Lake. Tens of thousands of daily wage workers have hardly any work.",
      "\u201cThere used to be long lines of tourists waiting for boat rides. There are none now,\u201d said boatman Fayaz Ahmed.",
      "Taxi driver Mohammed Irfan would take tourists for long drives to hill stations and show them grand Mughal-era gardens. \u201cEven a half day of break was a luxury, and we would pray for it. Now, my taxi lies standstill for almost two weeks,\u201d he said.",
      "In recent years, the tourism sector grew substantially, making up about 7% of the region\u2019s economy, according to official figures. Omar Abdullah, Kashmir\u2019s top elected official, said before the attack on tourists that the government was aiming to increase tourism's share of the economy to at least 15% in the next four to five years.",
      "Indian-controlled Kashmir was a top destination for visitors until the armed rebellion against Indian rule began in 1989. Warfare laid waste to the stunningly beautiful region, which is partly controlled by Pakistan and claimed by both countries in its entirety.",
      "As the conflict ground on, the tourism sector slowly revived but occasional military skirmishes between India and Pakistan kept visitors at bay.",
      "But India vigorously pushed tourism after Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government scrapped the disputed region\u2019s semi-autonomy in 2019. Tensions have simmered, but the region has also drawn millions of visitors amid a strange calm enforced by an intensified security crackdown.",
      "According to official data, close to 3 million tourists visited the region in 2024, a rise from 2.71 million visitors in 2023 and 2.67 million in 2022. The massive influx prompted many locals to invest in the sector, setting up family-run guesthouses, luxury hotels, and transport companies in a region with few alternatives.",
      "Tourists remained largely unfazed even as Modi\u2019s administration has governed Kashmir with an iron fist in recent years, claiming militancy in the region was in check and a tourism influx was a sign of normalcy returning.",
      "The massacre shattered those claims. Experts say that the Modi government\u2019s optimism was largely misplaced and that the rising tourism in the region of which it boasted was a fragile barometer of normalcy. Last year, Abdullah, the region\u2019s chief minister, cautioned against such optimism.",
      "Tuman, who is also a sixth-generation tour operator, said he was not too optimistic about an immediate revival as bookings for the summer were almost all canceled.",
      "\u201cIf all goes well, it will take at least six months for tourism to revive,\u201d he said.",
      "Ahmed, the hotels association official, said India and Pakistan need to resolve the dispute for the region\u2019s prosperity. \u201cTourism needs peace. If (Kashmir) problem is not solved \u2026 maybe after two months, it will be again same thing.\u201d",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. asked all of his Cabinet secretaries to submit resignations on Thursday in a \u201cbold reset\u201d of his administration following last week\u2019s mid-term elections, which saw more opposition candidates win crucial Senate seats.",
      "Marcos, the 67-year-old son of a late Philippine dictator overthrown in 1986, won the presidency in the deeply divided Southeast Asian country by a landslide in 2022 in a stunning political comeback as he made a steadfast call for national unity. But his equally popular vice-presidential running mate, Sara Duterte, later broke from him in a falling out that has sparked intense political discord.",
      "With support from treaty ally the United States and other friendly countries, Marcos emerged as the most vocal critic of China \u2019s growing aggression in the disputed South China Sea while contending with an array of longstanding domestic issues, including inflation \u2014 and delayed fulfillment of a campaign promise to bring down the price of rice \u2014 as well as many reports of kidnappings and other crimes.",
      "\u201cThis is not business as usual,\u201d Marcos was cited as saying in a government statement. \u201cThe people have spoken and they expect results \u2014 not politics, not excuses. We hear them and we will act.\u201d",
      "Marcos called for the \u201ccourtesy resignation of all Cabinet secretaries in a decisive move to recalibrate his administration following the results of the recent elections,\u201d the government statement said.",
      "\"The request for courtesy resignations is aimed at giving the president the elbow room to evaluate the performance of each department and determine who will continue to serve in line with his administration\u2019s recalibrated priorities,\u201d the government said.",
      "At least 21 Cabinet secretaries led by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin either immediately submitted their resignations or expressed their readiness to do so.",
      "\u201cThis is not about personalities \u2014 it\u2019s about performance, alignment and urgency,\u201d Marcos said. \u201cThose who have delivered and continue to deliver will be recognized. But we cannot afford to be complacent. The time for comfort zones is over.\u201d",
      "Government services will remain uninterrupted during the transition, the government said, adding that \u201cwith this bold reset, the Marcos administration signals a new phase \u2014 sharper, faster and fully focused on the people\u2019s most pressing needs.\"",
      "Five out of the 12 Senate seats contested in the mid-term elections were won by allies of Sara Duterte or her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who has been arrested and detained by the International Criminal Court in The Hague in the Netherlands. The elder Duterte, a staunch critic of Marcos, was accused of committing crimes against humanity over a brutal anti-drugs crackdown he launched that left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead.",
      "Marcos-endorsed senatorial candidates won five Senate seats while two other seats were unexpectedly won by two liberal democrats associated with the late former President Benigno Aquino III, whose family has long been at odds with the Marcoses.",
      "Voting for half of the 24-member Senate is crucial because the government body will hold an impeachment trial for Sara Duterte in July over an array of criminal allegations, including corruption and a public threat to assassinate Marcos, his wife and House Speaker Martin Romualdez. She made those threats in an online news conference in November but later issued a vague denial that she wanted the president killed.",
      "Sara Duterte is facing a separate criminal complaint for her threats against the Marcoses and Romualdez.",
      "Most of the seats in the House were won by candidates allied with Marcos and his cousin, Romualdez, in the May 12 elections, which many saw as a preview to the presidential elections scheduled for 2028.",

      "North Korea says a new 5,000-ton destroyer key to its naval advancement was damaged during its launching ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea's second naval destroyer was damaged in a failed launch this week, state media reported Thursday, sparking fury from leader Kim Jong Un, who wants bigger warships to deal with what he calls escalating U.S.-led threats against his country.",
      "It's not common for North Korea to acknowledge military-related setbacks, but observers say the disclosure of the failed ship launch suggests that Kim is serious about his naval advancement program and confident of ultimately achieving that objective.",
      "During a launching event at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, the newly built 5,000-ton-class destroyer became unbalanced and was punctured in its bottom sections after a transport cradle on the stern section slid off first and became stuck, according to the Korean Central News Agency.",
      "KCNA didn't provide details on what caused the problem, the severity of the damage or whether anyone was injured.",
      "According to KCNA, Kim, who was present at the ceremony, blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators for a \u201cserious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism.\" Kim called for a ruling Workers\u2019 Party meeting slated for late June to address their \u201cirresponsible errors.\"",
      "\u201cIt's a shameful thing. But the reason why North Korea disclosed the incident is it wants to show it's speeding up the modernization of its navy forces and expresses its confidence that it can eventually build\" a greater navy, said Moon Keun-sik, a navy expert who teaches at Seoul\u2019s Hanyang University.",
      "Moon suspected the incident likely happened because North Korean workers aren't yet familiar with such a large warship and were rushed to put it in the water.",
      "The damaged vessel was likely the same class as the country\u2019s first destroyer unveiled last month, which experts assessed as North Korea's largest and most advanced warship to date. Kim called the first vessel, named Choe Hyon \u2014 a famed Korean guerilla fighter during the Japanese colonial period \u2014 a significant asset for advancing his goal of expanding the military\u2019s operational range and nuclear strike capabilities.",
      "State media described that ship as designed to carry weapons systems including nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. Kim said the ship was expected to enter active duty early next year and later supervised test-firings of missiles from the warship.",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the damaged vessel was likely equipped with similar systems and remains toppled over in the sea. An Associated Press analysis of Planet Labs PBC images taken Thursday showed the ship partially submerged on its side with tarpaulins draped over the wreckage.",
      "Earlier commercial satellite images indicated that the country was building its second destroyer at a shipyard in Chongjin.",
      "Beyond Parallel, a website run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the satellite imagery of Chongjin\u2019s Hambuk shipyard on May 12 showed that a second vessel in the Choe Hyon-class of guided missile destroyers was under construction.",
      "A report by the North Korea-focused 38 North website assessed last week that the destroyer in Chongjin was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, a method that has been rarely used in North Korea. The report said the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo, in contrast, used a floating dry dock.",
      "South Korean officials and experts say the Choe Hyon destroyer was likely built with Russian assistance as the two countries' military partnerships are booming. While North Korea\u2019s naval forces are considered far inferior to those of its rivals, analysts say the destroyer with nuclear-capable missiles and an advanced radar system would still enhance the North's offensive and defensive capabilities.",
      "Kim has framed the arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the United States and South Korea, which have been expanding joint military exercises in response to the North\u2019s advancing nuclear program. He says the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening the North Korean navy.",
      "Hours after releasing the report on the damaged destroyer, North Korea test-fired multiple cruise missiles from an area about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Chongjin, according to South Korea's military. The launches were a continuation of a streak of weapons-testing activities by North Korea in recent years. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the launches were being analyzed by South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his government is talking to the U.S. about joining President Donald Trump\u2019s future Golden Dome missile defense program",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday his government is talking to the U.S. about joining President Donald Trump's future Golden Dome missile defense program.",
      "The multilayered, $175 billion system would for the first time put U.S. weapons in space. Trump said the previous day he expected the system to be fully operational by the end of his term in 2029.",
      "\"Is it a good idea for Canada? Yes, it is a good to have protections in place for Canadians,\" Carney said.",
      "Carney confirmed he's had talks with Trump about it and said there are discussions with senior officials. Trump said the Canadian government had contacted his administration indicating it wants to join the program and that he will work with Ottawa to ensure it contributes its \u201cfair share.\u201d",
      "Golden Dome is envisioned to include ground- and space-based capabilities to detect and stop missiles at all four major stages of a potential attack: detecting and destroying them before a launch, intercepting them in their earliest stage of flight, stopping them midcourse in the air, or halting them in the final minutes as they descend toward a target.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that we are looking at and something that has been discussed at a high level.\" Carney said. \u201cBut not I\u2019m not sure one negotiates on this. These are military decisions that have been taken in that context, and we will evaluate it accordingly.\u201d",
      "Carney warned that Canada faces potential missiles threats in the \u201cnot-too-distant future\u201d that could come from space.",
      "\u201cIs Canada going to be doing this alone or with the United States? Because with a Golden Dome, there will be discussions that could have an impact on Canada, but Canada wouldn't be a part of them,\u201d Carney said.",
      "The Pentagon has warned for years that the newest missiles developed by China and Russia are so advanced that updated countermeasures are necessary. Golden Dome\u2019s added satellites and interceptors \u2014 where the bulk of the program\u2019s cost is \u2014 would be focused on stopping those advanced missiles early on or in the middle of their flight.",
      "Canada and the U.S. are partners in the North American Aerospace Defense Command, the combined organization that provides shared defense of airspace over the two nations.",
      "The newly elected Carney spent much spent much of the last few months saying the old relationship with the U.S. based on steadily increasing integration is over. Trump has infuriated Canadians by saying Canada should be the 51st state.",
      "\u201cWe cooperate if necessary but not necessarily cooperate,\u201d Carney said.",

      "At least three vehicles and four people were involved in the killing of the personal secretary and a close adviser of Mexico City\u2019s mayor",
      "MEXICO CITY -- At least four people were involved in the killing of the personal secretary and a close adviser of Mexico City \u2019s Mayor Clara Brugada, the capital\u2019s police chief said Wednesday, as more details emerged of the worst attack against public officials in the capital in recent years.",
      "Pablo V\u00e1zquez Camacho said investigators had identified and found a motorcycle and two other vehicles used in the escape of the gunman who killed the two officials Tuesday morning as they traveled in a vehicle along a busy thoroughfare.",
      "Brugada's personal secretary, Ximena Guzm\u00e1n, and an adviser, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, were shot dead in Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s car, authorities said.",
      "Mexico City chief prosecutor Bertha Alcalde Luj\u00e1n said the gunman had fled on a motorcycle that was hidden nearby and then changed vehicles twice as he and others fled into neighboring Mexico State.",
      "Clothes were recovered in the vehicles and were being analyzed, but investigators could not yet offer a possible motive, the prosecutor said.",
      "She said Guzm\u00e1n was shot eight times and Mu\u00f1oz four times.",
      "Alcalde said that given the circumstances, investigators believe \u201cit was a direct attack and with an important degree of planning and those who killed them had previous experience.\u201d",
      "Still, she said investigators could not yet propose a motive or say who was behind the killings.",
      "\u201cWe cannot conclude that this is tied to organized crime, much less speak now of a particular organized crime group,\u201d Alcalde said.",
      "Both officials said Wednesday that investigators had detected the presence of an individual at the site of the attacks days before they occurred, which would suggest knowledge of the victims' routines.",
      "The attack, which happened at around 7 a.m., left four bullet holes clustered on the driver\u2019s side of the windshield. One body lay on the pavement.",
      "V\u00e1zquez Camacho said that neither Guzm\u00e1n nor Mu\u00f1oz had any special security measures, but both had received training about protecting themselves.",
      "\u201cThey are people who worked very closely with the people ... and they did their work without fear,\u201d he said.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum, who is an ally of Brugada and a former mayor of Mexico City before winning the presidency last year, had declined to speculate on the possible involvement of organized crime during her press briefing earlier Wednesday.",
      "At the scene of the attack Wednesday morning, hundreds of commuters passed with most oblivious to what had occurred a day earlier. Some, however, noticed the handwritten signs with messages of remembrance to the two victims and flowers and candles left on the sidewalk.",
      "University student Loretta Garc\u00eda Oriz said she had passed the site Tuesday when Guzm\u00e1n and Mu\u00f1oz's bodies were still at the scene. \u201cPassing here gives me the same trauma,\u201d she said Wednesday.",
      "Oscar S\u00e1nchez's taco stand isn't far from the crime scene, but said Wednesday he didn't know what had happened until another vendor told him and police began to set up a perimeter. The attack showed that it doesn't matter if you're an official or an average person, he said. \"It's all the same.\"",
      "Mexico City's mayor is considered second in political importance only to the president. The mayor's office has long been a stepping stone to the presidency, something true for Sheinbaum and her predecessor.",
      "But for years, the idea has prevailed of Mexico City as a relatively peaceful oasis protected from the brutal drug cartel violence prevalent in other parts of the country. There has always been street crime, but the cartels, while present, maintained a lower profile in the capital.",
      "That illusion was partially dashed in 2020 with the brazen ambush of Mexico City's then police chief on another central boulevard. Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch was wounded, but two bodyguards and a bystander were killed in the attack involving more than 20 people and heavy weaponry.",
      "Garc\u00eda Harfuch immediately blamed the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.",
      "There had not been another such attack on public officials in the capital since then.",

      "\u201cIf anyone participates or takes any similar action, it will amount to support for a passive coup,\u201d Brig. Gen. Omar Khan told The Associated Press. \u201cAnything along those lines will speak to a violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d",
      "The May 25 election organized by Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is the latest step in a push to annex the Essequibo region, which Venezuela has long claimed as its own.",
      "Venezuelans living in Guyana who become involved in Sunday\u2019s elections could also face arrest and deportation, Khan added.",
      "Nearly 100,000 people of direct or indirect Venezuelan ancestry currently live in Guyana, according to Foreign Secretary Robert Persaud.",
      "\u201cShouldn\u2019t this reality give all Guyanese a cause to be alert? People\u2019s vigilance is equivalent to people\u2019s power and defense,\u201d Persaud said in a recent social media post.",
      "The Essequibo region represents two-thirds of Guyana and is rich in gold, diamonds, timber and other natural resources. It also is located close to massive offshore oil deposits, with current production averaging some 650,000 barrels daily.",
      "On Sunday, Venezuelans will head to the polls to elect governors and lawmakers, as well as officials who would supposedly administer the Essequibo region.",
      "In 2023, Maduro threatened to annex the region by force after holding a referendum asking voters if Essequibo should be turned into a Venezuelan state.",
      "The dispute over the region began more than a century ago, when an international tribunal in 1899 drew the border between the South American neighbors.",
      "In 2018, Guyana went to the International Court of Justice and asked judges to uphold the 1899 ruling. Meanwhile, Venezuela has dismissed the border drawn more than a century ago, noting Guyana was still a British colony. It has argued that a 1966 agreement to resolve the dispute effectively nullified the original arbitration.",
      "The case is still pending in court while tensions between the two countries keep rising despite an emergency summit held in late 2023 to diffuse the situation.",
      "Last week, Guyana\u2019s government reported three separate attacks from the Venezuelan side on Guyanese soldiers patrolling a border river. Earlier this year, six Guyanese soldiers were injured in a separate attack, some of them seriously.",
      "U.S. Ambassador Nicole Theriot has dismissed Maduro\u2019s threats as \u201cjust bluster aimed at shoring up domestic support.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone should see the sham for what it is. It\u2019s saber-rattling from the Maduro regime, nothing more,\u201d she said at a public forum Tuesday, stressing that the U.S. stands with Guyana.",

      "So, how much does the pope bench? Masella can\u2019t speak to his papal power, since Prevost was focused on posture and cardiovascular capacity. He ran on his favorite treadmill that faces a mural featuring famous local landmarks, among them St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican.",
      "\u201cWe would start off slow and then go pretty strong, I must say. Especially a lot of resistance on the exercise bike, a very strong climb,\u201d Masella said.",
      "Throughout their two-year training, Masella never knew Prevost was a cardinal, nor did he hear him utter a discouraging word.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard him make a comment about anything that wasn\u2019t positive. He was always positive about everything -- the weather, the city, the people, also for me, he said he liked the gym.\u201d",
      "A Vatican spokesperson didn't reply when asked for comment.",
      "A sporting pope isn\u2019t new. Pope John Paul II, who was elected at the age of 58, was an avid skier and mountain trekker.",
      "Chicago-born Prevost\u2019s game is tennis. On May 15, he met top-ranked player Jannik Sinner, who gave him a racket and offered to play during an off day at the Italian Open. Leo had said earlier in the week that he would be up for a charity match when it was suggested by a journalist.",
      "After Prevost took over the Vatican\u2019s Dicastery for Bishops in 2023, he said in an interview with the Augustinian Order that his new job had left him little free time to practice his game. While the Mediterranean climate makes tennis possible year-round, the papacy will likely leave him even fewer chances to step onto a court.",
      "Tamburlani, the Omega owner, says the Holy Father is welcome back any time he wants to squeeze in a workout. After all, his membership's still active.",
      "\u201cThis would make us so happy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would organize our gym to guarantee his safety and his privacy. We would just need a sign.\u201d",

      "The lawsuit, filed in January, alleged that PepsiCo was giving unfair price advantages to Walmart at the expense of other vendors and consumers.

      "The Sound Talent Group said co-founder Dave Shapiro died in the crash. He is listed as the plane's owner and has a pilot's license, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The talent agency did not provide the names of the other employees.",
      "At least 100 residents were moved to a nearby elementary school serving as an evacuation center, the San Diego Police Department said.",

      "The budget reconciliation bill passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- The multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed by House Republicans early Thursday would gut clean energy tax credits that Democrats approved three years ago while supporting increased mining, drilling and other traditional energy production.",
      "A marathon session that began Wednesday resulted in 1,100-plus page legislation that curbs billions of dollars in spending across food assistance, student loans, Medicaid and action to address climate change.",
      "The bill, which now heads to the Senate, repeals or phases out more quickly clean energy tax credits passed in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act during former President Joe Biden's term. Biden\u2019s climate law has been considered monumental for the clean energy transition, but the House bill effectively renders moot much of the law's incentives for renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "Clean energy advocates said the bill walks back the largest government investment in clean energy in history.",
      "\u201cIn a bid to cut taxes for billionaires and provide a grab bag of goodies to Big Oil, the majority in the House took a sledgehammer to clean energy tax credits and to the protection of our public lands,\" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "\u201cThese credits are delivering billions of dollars in new investments in homegrown American energy -- creating jobs, lowering energy costs and addressing the climate crisis that is fueling floods, fires and heat waves,'' Goldfuss said.",
      "President Donald Trump celebrated the bill\u2019s passage, calling it \u201carguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country.\u201d Trump appealed to the Senate to pass the measure as soon as possible and send it to his desk.",
      "The Senate hopes to wrap up its version by the Fourth of July holiday. At least four Republican senators, led by Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have urged continuation of energy tax credits, including support for traditional and renewable energy sources. Republican-led states and Congressional districts have benefited from billions of dollars in clean energy manufacturing investments spurred by the Biden-era subsidies.",
      "Full-scale repeal of current credits \"could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,'' the senators said in a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.",
      "\"A wholesale repeal, or the termination of certain individual credits, would create uncertainty, jeopardizing capital allocation, long-term project planning and job creation in the energy sector and across our broader economy,\u201d the senators wrote in the April 9 letter. The letter was also signed by GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Jerry Moran of Kansas.",
      "In a win for House moderates and some Western lawmakers, the House bill strips language that would have allowed the sale of hundreds of thousands acres of public lands in Utah and Nevada. Opponents argued the sales would have opened the door for more oil and gas drilling.",
      "The House bill takes an axe to tax credits for rooftop solar installments and eliminates electric vehicle tax credits after 2025, with a one-year exception for EVs manufactured by automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 cars that qualified for the credit.",
      "Credits for solar and electric vehicles, which reduce harmful emissions, help to boost demand for the technologies and drive down their cost.",
      "House Republicans also tightened tax credit restrictions for projects associated with foreign entities, including China \u2014 an added blow to domestic clean energy expansion since China dominates much of the supply chain.",
      "The bill slashes a three-year phase-down schedule previously proposed, and instead cuts off projects that don\u2019t start construction within 60 days of the bill\u2019s passage. Those projects would also have to start operating before 2029.",
      "\u201cThis bill threatens the clean energy industry at a time when it\u2019s proving to be not only economically beneficial \u2014 lowering costs, creating jobs and fueling local economies \u2014 but also essential to America\u2019s energy future,\" said Andrew Reagan, president of Clean Energy for America, an industry group.",
      "At the behest of Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke and some other Republicans, lawmakers stripped a provision that would have sold or transferred about 460,000 acres (186,155 hectares) of federal land in Nevada and Utah to local governments or private entities.",
      "The proposal exposed sharp divisions between Western Republicans who say the federal government controls too much of their states and others such as Zinke, a former Interior secretary in Trump\u2019s first term whose state is protective of access to lands for hunting and recreation.",
      "\u201cOnce the land is sold, we will never get it back,\u201d Zinke said after the provision\u2019s removal. \u201dPublic access, sportsmanship, grazing tourism \u2014 our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.\u201d",
      "The land sales had been inserted in an early version of the bill following a late-night committee vote, despite earlier pledges from Republican leaders that land sales were off the table.",
      "Supporters said the sales would generate revenue and ease growth pressures by creating room for more and cheaper housing in booming Western cities such as Las Vegas, Reno, Nevada and St. George, Utah. Those communities are hemmed in by federal property, which makes up 80% of the land in Nevada and 63% in Utah. Some states in the Midwest and East have 1% or less federal land by comparison.",
      "A spokesperson for Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who sponsored the bid to sell federal lands in his state, said his office was \u201cexploring all options\u201d to make the transfers happen.",
      "Housing advocates had cautioned federal land is not universally suitable for affordable housing, and some of the parcels to be sold were far from developed areas.",
      "Tracy Stone-Manning, president of the Wilderness Society and a former director of the Bureau of Land Management Bureau under Biden, said she appreciated Zinke\u2019s work to prevent the public lands sale.",
      "But she added that the bill was still a \u201cbig giveaway\u201d to the private sector. \u201cBy opening hundreds of millions of acres to drilling, mining and logging to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, this bill harms the tens of millions of people who like to hike, recreate or find solace in the outdoors,\u201d she said.",
      "At the same time the bill slashes support for clean energy, it paves the way for oil, gas and coal.",
      "Through the bill, natural gas pipeline developers can pay a $10 million fee for expedited permitting, and applicants for a potential liquefied natural gas export site can pay a $1 million fee to be deemed in the \u201cpublic interest,\u201d circumventing what is usually a regulatory challenge.",

      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose. The average rate ticked up to 6.01% from 5.92% last week. It\u2019s down from 6.24% a year ago, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including global demand for U.S. Treasurys, the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions and bond market investors\u2019 expectations about the economy and inflation.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, which it set in mid-January. The average rate\u2019s low point so far was five weeks ago, when it briefly dropped to 6.62%. It\u2019s now at its highest level since Feb. 13, when it averaged 6.87%.",
      "The elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have discouraged home shoppers, leading to a lackluster start to the spring homebuying season, even as the inventory of homes on the market is up sharply from last year. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last month to the slowest pace for the month of April going back to 2009.",
      "The recent rise in mortgage rates reflects moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which had mostly fallen after climbing to around 4.8% in mid-January, began rising March amid investor anxiety over the Trump administration's trade war. It rose again last week after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade dispute, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve won\u2019t have to cut interest rates  as deeply as expected this year in order to shield the economy from the damage of tariffs.",

      "\u201cSince mortgage rates closely track the 10-year yield, this upward pressure has translated into increased borrowing costs for homebuyers, which means higher mortgage rates,\u201d said Jiayi Xu, an economist at Realtor.com.",
      "The increase in mortgage rates is discouraging some would-be homebuyers during what\u2019s traditionally the busiest period of the year for home sales. Last week, mortgage applications fell 5.1% from a week earlier as home loan borrowing costs increased, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Applications for a loan to buy a home were still up 13% from a year earlier.",
      "Economists expect mortgage rates to remain volatile in coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain between 6% and 7% this year.",

      "Increased scrutiny of childhood vaccines \u2014 credited with saving millions of people from deadly diseases \u2014 figures prominently in the report. It poses questions over the necessity of school mandates that require children to get vaccinated for admittance and suggestions that vaccines should undergo more clinical trials, including with placebos.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, has raised doubts about the safety of shots even as a measles outbreak has sickened more than 1,000 Americans. This week, Kennedy\u2019s health department moved to limit U.S. access to COVID-19 shots.",
      "The report does not provide any evidence that the childhood vaccine schedule, which includes shots for measles, polio and the chickenpox, is to blame for rising obesity, diabetes or autism rates, said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not as if they\u2019re positing any kind of causal link,\u201d Adalja said, adding that Kennedy is \u201cis trying to devalue vaccines in the minds of Americans.\u201d",
      "Parts of the report highlight growing factions within the Trump administration's MAHA movement, even as the report strained to appease opposing forces within the politically diverse coalition that Trump and Kennedy have fostered.",
      "The report makes dozens of references to dietary guidelines and standards in Europe, but Environmental Protection Agency head Lee Zeldin promised it would not yield more rigorous regulations.",
      "\u201cThis cannot happen through a European mandate system that stifles growth,\u201d Zeldin said in a call with reporters.",
      "Despite numerous studies and statements throughout the MAHA report that raise concerns about American food products, Trump Cabinet officials insisted during a call with reporters on Thursday that the nation's food supply is safe.",
      "The report mentions that glyphosate, a commonly used chemical sprayed on crops, may cause serious health problems, including cancer. The World Health Organization has said that the chemical is a probable carcinogen to humans, although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is unlikely.",
      "Farmers, who \u2014 alongside Republican lawmakers \u2014 hounded the Trump administration leading up to the report's release, swiftly criticized the report's comments on the chemicals.",
      "\u201cThe Make America Healthy Again Report is filled with fear-based rather than science-based information about pesticides,\u201d the National Corn Growers Association said in a statement.",
      "But Kennedy's MAHA supporters were also disappointed, saying the report didn't go far enough when it came to chemicals used on crops.",
      "\u201cIf the Trump White House and Republicans don't take pesticides and glyphosate's link to human health issues seriously, it will cost them the MAHA vote in the midterms,\u201d said Dave Murphy, a former Kennedy fundraiser who spearheaded a push for the issue to be addressed in the report.",
      "Talking about the report on Thursday, Trump reiterated his \u201clove\u201d for farmers.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins acknowledged the tight rope Trump officials are walking to keep farmers, many of them in Republican-leaning states, happy while also working to satisfy Kennedy's eclectic and health-conscious following.",
      "\u201cDo all of us agree on everything? Of course not,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cBut the place that we have landed, which is, I think all of us agree, is that this is not a binary choice between an industry, agriculture and health.\u201d",
      "The report comes out stronger, however, against ultraprocessed foods \u2014 industrially made products high in refined grains, sugar, saturated fats and additives like artificial dyes that now make up two-thirds of the diet for U.S. teens and children. Such products have been linked to a host of poor health outcomes, though documenting how they cause those problems has been notoriously difficult and time-consuming.",
      "The MAHA commission report \u201cis a pretty accurate depiction of the nutrition crisis facing our country,\u201d said Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, an expert in nutrition and policy at Tufts University.",
      "The report focuses not only on ultraprocessed foods, but also on how too few fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds and fish are present in U.S. diets, he noted. But the report leaves out excess salt, which causes harm, even in young children.",
      "The MAHA report calls on the National Institutes of Health to execute sweeping, nationwide studies of ultraprocessed foods, even as the White House has called for $18 billion to be axed from the agency's budget. An extra $500 million has been requested from Congress for Kennedy's MAHA initiative.",
      "The report raises concerns about other environmental and chemical research results, funded by corporations and industry, being skewed.",
      "But the MAHA commission's call for more neutral research comes as sweeping budget and staff cuts propelled by Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency have resulted in 20,000 jobs lost at the nation\u2019s health department and billions of dollars rescinded for research studies. The Trump administration also gutted the Environmental Public Health Tracking Program in its cuts of health-tracking programs.",
      "The report also raises concerns about the lack of physical activity among children and their prescription drug use, including antibiotics and medications used to treat attention deficit disorders.",
      "Some in the MAHA movement have raised concerns about offering medications, even over-the-counter drugs like pain relievers, to children.",
      "But Trump spent 10 minutes during Thursday's event telling MAHA supporters how he's working to lower the cost of prescription drugs. The East Room crowd, packed full of MAHA supporters that offered applause for Trump's calls to investigate chronic disease in children, responded mildly \u2014 and eventually stopped clapping entirely \u2014 as he continued to talk about lowering drug costs.",
      "\u201cI think it's going to go down as one of the most important things we've ever down because drug prices are going to go down,\u201d he said, as Kennedy looked on.",

      "The Senate has voted to block California\u2019s first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted on Thursday to block California\u2019s first-in-the nation rule banning the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, moving to kill the country's most aggressive effort to transition toward electric vehicles as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has doubled down on fossil fuels.",
      "The measure overturning the rule now goes to the White House, where Trump is expected to sign it, along with two other resolutions that would block California rules curbing tailpipe emissions in certain vehicles and smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks. All three measures were approved by the Senate on Thursday and by the House earlier this month.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state air regulators say that what Congress is doing is illegal and they will sue to keep the rules in place.",
      "\u201cThis is not about electric vehicles,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference while the Senate was still voting on the measures. \u201cThis is about polluters being able to pollute more.\u201d",
      "California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state plans to sue over the way that Republicans passed the measures blocking the emissions rules. Senate Republicans established a narrow exception to the filibuster Wednesday to clear the way for the votes.",
      "The GOP effort could have a profound impact on California\u2019s longtime efforts to curb air pollution. California makes up roughly 11% of the U.S. car market, giving it significant power to shape purchasing trends \u2014 especially because about a dozen states have already followed California's lead. Vehicles are one of the largest sources of planet-warming emissions.",
      "Senate Democrats charged that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and they say California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the votes should \u201csend a chill down the spine of legislators in every state.\"",
      "\u201cWhat we have at stake is a state\u2019s ability, it\u2019s right to make its own laws and to protect its own citizens, without having this body overturn that right,\u201d Schiff said.",
      "Republicans say the phaseout of gas-powered cars, along with other waivers that California has obtained from the EPA, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation\u2019s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate.",
      "\u201cAmerica cannot meet these impossible standards \u2013- not next year, and not in 10 years,\u201d said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the second-ranking Republican.",
      "Newsom announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.",
      "The Biden administration approved the state\u2019s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.",
      "Biden\u2019s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.",
      "Republicans have long criticized California's waivers and have worked to find a way to overturn them. The Government Accountability Office said earlier this year that California\u2019s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances with a simple majority vote not subject to the filibuster. The Senate parliamentarian agreed with that ruling, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way for the votes anyway with a workaround that established a new Senate precedent.",
      "Democrats fought those changes, which were the latest attempt to chip away at the Senate filibuster after both parties have used their majorities in the past two decades to lower the threshold for nominations. Democrats tried in 2022 to roll back the filibuster for legislation, as well, but were thwarted by members of their own caucus who disagreed with the effort.",
      "Republicans have insisted that they would not try a similar move after regaining the majority this year. But Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the move to block California\u2019s laws were a \u201cpoint of no return\u201d and called the Republicans \u201cfair weather institutionalists.\u201d",
      "Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan was the only Democrat to support the measure to block the phaseout of gas-powered vehicles. She said in a statement after the vote that she has a \u201cspecial responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.\u201d",
      "John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry association and lobby group, said there is a gap between the vehicles that car buyers are purchasing and the rules that would force a transition to electric vehicles.",

      "BELGRADE, Serbia -- The European Union\u2019s top foreign policy official said Thursday that membership candidate Serbia faces a \u201cstrategic choice\u201d of direction, just weeks after Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic defied EU warnings and attended Russia\u2019s Victory Day parade in Moscow.",
      "\u201cSerbia faces a strategic, geostrategic choice, where it wants to be,\" Kaja Kallas said during her visit to Belgrade. \u201cSerbia\u2019s European future depends on the values it chooses to uphold.\u201d",
      "Vucic's appearance in Moscow for the May 9 parade was widely condemned in Brussels, with EU officials warning that such actions seriously jeopardize Serbia\u2019s EU path. The officials said that it was inappropriate for Vucic to stand side by side with Russian President Vladimir Putin, considering Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Kallas said that she discussed the visit with Vucic.",
      "\u201cAnd I expressed my views, which are very clear,\" she said.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t understand why it is necessary to stand side by side with the person who is conducting this horrible war in Ukraine,\" she said. \"And President Vucic was explaining his side of the story. So, yes, we had a very extensive discussion about this.\u201d",
      "Vucic, a former extreme nationalist criticized at home and abroad over alleged increasingly authoritarian ways, has maintained close relations with both Russia and China, while formally saying that he wants Serbia to join the EU.",
      "Vucic has said his decision to attend Putin\u2019s military parade, which marked the World War II victory over Nazi Germany, was part of efforts to maintain \u201ctraditional friendships\u201d \u2014 Russia is a fellow Slavic and Orthodox Christian nation \u2014 while seeking EU entry.",
      "Serbia, which relies almost fully on Russia for energy, has refused to join Western sanctions on Russia over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and hasn\u2019t supported most EU statements condemning the aggression.",
      "Vucic also has been under pressure at home following six months of large anti-corruption protests that erupted after a train station tragedy in Serbia\u2019s north that killed 16 people and which many in the country blamed on state officials' graft during infrastructure construction.",
      "\u201cFrom my discussions with the Serbian political leadership, it is clear that EU membership remains a strategic goal,\u201d Kallas said. \u201cHowever, I want to emphasize that we need to see actions also to prove and support those words.\u201d",
      "\u201cReforms are how Serbia will advance along its EU path,\" Kallas added. \"There are no shortcuts for membership. Real progress must be made here in Belgrade.\u201d",
      "She said she also met the protesting \u201cyouth,\u201d referring to the students who have led months of demonstrations, and called for Serbia to make serious efforts on media freedom, combating corruption and electoral reform.",
      "\u201cThese reforms will bring real benefits for the citizens and the people of Serbia as hundreds of thousands of protesters have been demanding in recent weeks. The autonomy of the universities must be respected,\u201d she said.",

      "EU-mediated talks between the two neighboring states have been long been frozen. Kallas said normalization of relations between Serbia and Kosovo is \u201cfundamental\u201d for their European future.",
      "\u201cIt is time the two countries to overcome the past a focus on the common future,\u201d she said. \u201cI plan to invite the representatives from Belgrade and Pristina to Brussels as soon as possible to discuss the concrete steps forward.\u201d",

      "\u201cStability depends on dialogue, not confrontation,\u201d she said at a news conference.",
      "Kallas said that Brussels \u201chas begun to gradually lift measures introduced in June 2023,\u201d adding that a full lifting is \u201cconditional on sustained de-escalation in the north.\u201d",
      "Most of the ethnic Serb minority population lives in four municipalities in northern Kosovo, which has seen tensions rise in the last three years.",

      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in April, as elevated mortgage rates and rising prices discouraged prospective homebuyers during what\u2019s traditionally the busiest time of the year for the housing market.",
      "Existing home sales dropped 0.5% last month, from March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. The sales decline marks the slowest sales pace for the month of April going back to 2009 in the wake of the U.S. housing crisis. March\u2019s sales pace was also the slowest for that month going back to 2009.",
      "Sales fell 2% compared with April last year. The latest home sales fell slightly short of the 4.10 million pace economists were expecting, according to FactSet.",
      "Home prices increased on an annual basis for the 22nd consecutive month, although at the slowest rate since July 2023. The national median sales price rose 1.8% in April from a year earlier to $414,000, an all-time high for the month of April.",
      "\u201cThe affordability condition is clearly hurting the market, particularly higher mortgage rates,\u201d said Lawrence Yun, NAR\u2019s chief economist.",
      "For the past three years, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes have been at about 75% of what they were before the pandemic. The market slump began in early 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Homes sales fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, which it set in mid-January, according to mortgage buyer Freddie Mac. The average rate\u2019s low point so far was five weeks ago, when it briefly dropped to 6.62%. This week, it averaged 6.86%, its highest level since mid-February.",
      "Homes purchased last month likely went under contract in March and April, when the average rate on a 30-year mortgage ranged from 6.62% to 6.83%.",
      "High mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have frozen out many would-be homebuyers struggling to find a home they can afford.",
      "Homeownership is out of reach for many Americans after years of surging home prices. The median U.S. home sales price has jumped 53% over the past six years.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to buy at current mortgage rates are benefiting from more homes on the market when compared with recent years.",
      "There were 1.45 million unsold homes at the end of last month, a 9% increase from March, and 20.8% higher than April last year, NAR said. That's the most homes on the market since September 2020, but it's still well below the roughly 2 million homes for sale that was typical before the pandemic.",
      "The latest unsold inventory snapshot translates to a 4.4-month supply at the current sales pace, up from a 3.5-month pace at the end of April last year. Traditionally, a 5- to 6-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyers and sellers.",
      "One reason the inventory of homes for sale has been rising is that properties are taking longer to sell. Homes typically remained on the market for 29 days last month before selling, up from 26 days in April last year, NAR said.",
      "The wider selection of homes on the market likely helped boost sales among first-time homebuyers. They accounted for 34% of sales last month, the highest level since July 2020, but that is still down from the historical norm of 40%.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to sidestep mortgage rates and pay all cash for a home accounted for 25% of sales last month, down from 28% a year earlier. Investors, who account for many all-cash purchases, made up 15% of homes sold last month, down from 16% a year earlier, NAR said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Government advisers are meeting Thursday to decide if COVID-19 vaccines need updating to improve protection this fall and winter \u2014 even as a new Trump administration policy has thrown into question who may be eligible for a shot.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s outside experts have met regularly since the launch of the first COVID-19 vaccines to discuss tweaking their recipes to stay ahead of the virus. Thursday\u2019s meeting is the group's first since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "But it comes just two days after FDA leaders upended the prior U.S. policy of recommending annual COVID-19 boosters for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "Instead, the FDA said routine approval of COVID-19 boosters will be limited to seniors and to younger people who are at high risk of severe infection. Manufacturers will need to do new studies to show whether seasonal shots still benefit healthy people younger than 65.",
      "That raises big implications for next fall's vaccination campaign, with uncertainty over whether healthy people still could get a vaccine even if it's not recommended for them \u2014 or whether insurers will keep paying for the shots for everyone. Nor is it clear what the policy means for babies who have never been vaccinated.",
      "\u201cThis is a mess,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease expert. \u201cThe one thing we don't want to do is put a barrier in place that prevents parents from getting their children vaccinated if they want to.\u201d",
      "FDA's independent advisers may raise those issues Thursday, but the changes are not the focus of the meeting, which was scheduled before FDA\u2019s announcement.",
      "Instead, the panel is set to recommend whether the virus has mutated enough to warrant strain updates for shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax.",
      "\u201cWe are asking for guidance to help the FDA decide what strain to select for COVID-19 vaccines going forward,\u201d FDA vaccine chief Dr. Vinay Prasad said in comments opening the meeting. Prasad added that the agency wants \u201cto give people a little more time to digest,\u201d the new policy on vaccines and is open to feedback.",
      "Last fall\u2019s recipe was tailored to omicron descendants on the JN.1 branch of the virus family tree. Novavax brewed shots targeting the parent JN.1 variant while Pfizer and Moderna opted for a subtype called KP.2.",
      "That JN.1 family still dominates, although it continues to evolve. The question is whether last fall\u2019s shots still offer enough cross-protection or if manufacturers instead should match today\u2019s most common subtype, called LP.8.1.",
      "The World Health Organization recently said last year's version was OK but that vaccine makers could choose an update. The European Medicines Agency instead recommended targeting the newest subtype.",
      "FDA officials didn\u2019t express a preference in documents posted online ahead of Thursday\u2019s meeting. suggested earlier in the week that the government should move away from yearly updates.",
      "\u201cInstead of having a COVID-19 strategy that\u2019s year-to-year where we change things every single year, why don\u2019t we let the science tell us when to change?\u201d Prasad said.",
      "Debating that science is what the FDA's vaccine advisers do each year. If they recommend leaving the shots unchanged \u2014 and the FDA agrees \u2014 it's possible that healthy adults and children may still get access to a fall booster, since this week's policy changes suggest new studies would be required only if manufacturers switch strains or introduce a completely new vaccine. Those would be large, six-month studies, and vaccine experts question if their cost and logistics could make them unfeasible.",
      "Still, the FDA's strain decision normally isn't the final word on recommendations about who should be vaccinated.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's own advisory panel meets in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are keeping universal access or recommending vaccination for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice in getting a shot.",
      "Prasad and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary were both outspoken critics of the government\u2019s handling of COVID-19 shots during the pandemic, particularly the recommendation for use in young, healthy adults and children. Before joining government, they each garnered attention from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who built a national following by casting doubt on the safety and benefits of vaccines.",
      "In a medical journal editorial outlining the FDA\u2019s new approach, they criticized the U.S.\u2019s \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach, saying it has long been out of step with Europe and other places with more limited recommendations for boosters.",

      "Applications for jobless benefits fell by 2,000 to 227,000 for the week ending May 17, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s pretty close to the 230,000 new applications analysts forecast.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are seen as representative of U.S. layoffs and have mostly bounced around a historically healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 ravaged the economy and wiped out millions of jobs five years ago.",

      "Fed chair Jerome Powell said the potential for both higher unemployment and inflation are elevated, an unusual combination that complicates the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.",
      "Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment and the government recently reported that the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace in the first quarter of 2025. Growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the U.S. tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",
      "Trump is attempting to reshape the global economy by dramatically increasing import taxes to rejuvenate the U.S. manufacturing sector.",

      "Amber Salazar is the kind of idealist you just knew would end up running a store like Banned Wagon Books",
      "NEW YORK -- Amber Salazar is the kind of idealist you just knew would end up running a bookstore \u2014 a lifelong reader who felt angered \u201cto the core\u201d as she learned of book bans around the country.",
      "A resident of Colorado Springs, Colorado, Salazar last year opened Banned Wagon Books, a pop-up store she sets up everywhere from wineries to coffee shops, featuring such frequently censored works as Maia Kobabe's \u201cGender Queer,\u201d Angie Thomas' \u201cThe Hate U Give\u201d and Toni Morrison's \u201cBeloved.\u201d",
      "\u201cI decided that no matter what it looked like, I was going to open a bookstore so that I could contribute in some small way and stand up for intellectual freedom in the U.S.,\u201d explains Salazar, 33, who donates 5% of her profits to the American Library Association and other organizations opposing bans. \u201cSince we were coming out of the pandemic at that time, I started thinking about ways to combine my love of literature and passion for intellectual freedom with my appreciation for the small businesses in my city who weathered some difficult storms through shutdowns and supply chain concerns.\u201d",
      "Salazar is among a wave of new \u2014 and, often, younger \u2014 owners who have helped the independent book community dramatically expand, intensify and diversify. Independent bookselling is not a field for fortune seekers: Most local stores, whether run by retirees, bookworms or those switching careers in middle age, have some sense of higher purpose. But for many who opened in recent years, it's an especially critical mission. Narrative in Somerville, Massachusetts, identifies as \u201cproudly immigrant-woman owned & operated, with an emphasis on amplifying marginalized voices & experiences.\u201d In Chicago, Call & Response places \u201cthe voices of Black and other authors of color at the center of our work.\u201d",
      "Independent stores will likely never recover their power of 50 years ago, before the rise of Barnes & Noble superstores and the online giant Amazon.com. But the days of industry predictions of their demise seem well behind. In 2016, there were 1,244 members in the American Booksellers Association trade group, at 1,749 locations. As of this month, the ABA has 2,863 individual members, at 3,281 locations. And more than 200 stores are in the process of opening.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, this kind of energy,\u201d says association CEO Allison Hill, remembering how, during the pandemic, she feared that the ABA could lose up to a quarter of its membership. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us would have predicted this a few years ago.\u201d",
      "Hill and others acknowledge that even during an era of growth, booksellers remain vulnerable to political and economic challenges. Costs of supplies remain high and could grow higher because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. ABA President Cynthia Compton, who runs two stores in the Indianapolis area, says that sales to schools are down because censorship laws have made educators more cautious about what they purchase.",
      "The ABA\u2019s own website advises: \u201cPassion and knowledge have to be combined with business acumen if your bookstore is to succeed.\u201d",
      "Salazar herself is part of an Instagram chat group, Bookstores Helping Bookstores, with such like-minded sellers as the owners of The Crafty Bookstore in Bloomington, Indiana, \u201cspecializing in Indie books & custom bookish accessories,\u201d and the Florida-based Chapter Bound, an online store with a calling \u201cto connect great books with great people \u2014 at prices everyone can afford.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the age of social media, people are craving genuine connection and community,\u201d Salazar says. \u201cAnd books often provide a catalyst to that feeling of community.\u201d",
      "Stephen Sparks, who is 47 and since 2017 has owned Point Reyes Books northwest of San Francisco, believes that the pandemic gave sellers of all ages a heightened sense of their role in the community and that the return of Trump to the White House added new urgency. Sales are up 20% this year, he says, if only because \u201cduring tough times, people come to bookstores.\u201d",
      "The younger owners bring with them a wide range of prior experience. Salazar had worked in retail management for nine years, switched to property and casualty insurance sales \u201cin search of advancement opportunity\u201d and, right before she launched her store, was a business process owner, \u201ca blend of project management, customer and employee experience management.\u201d",
      "Courtney Bledsoe, owner of Call & Response, had been a corporate attorney before undertaking a \u201cfull career shift\u201d and risking a substantial drop in income.

      "A Thai court has ordered exiled former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to pay more than $304 million to compensate for losses incurred by a money-losing rice farming subsidy program that her government had implemented more than a decade ago",
      "BANGKOK -- A Thai court on Thursday ordered exiled former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra to pay more than 10 billion baht ($304 million) to compensate for losses incurred by a money-losing rice farming subsidy program that her administration had implemented more than a decade ago.",
      "The Supreme Administrative Court partially reversed a 2021 court ruling that cleared her. It found her guilty of severe negligence in relation to rice sales to other countries and said she failed to act on many government agencies\u2019 warnings of possible corruption.",
      "She was ordered to pay half of the damages estimated at more than 20 billion baht ($608 million). The court annulled a 2016 order by the Finance Ministry for her to pay 35.7 billion baht ($1.1 billion) in compensation, saying Yingluck was not proven directly responsible for the alleged corruption.",
      "The rice subsidy program was a flagship policy that helped Yingluck\u2019s Pheu Thai Party win the 2011 general election. Under the program, the government paid farmers about 50% more than they would have received on the global market, with the intention of driving up prices by warehousing the grain.",
      "But other rice-producing countries captured the international rice market by selling at competitive prices. Thailand as a result lost its position as the world\u2019s leading rice exporter and large amounts of rice sat unsold in government warehouses.",
      "After the ruling, Yingluck posted on her Facebook page that she had no intention to cause damages and was being held responsible \u201cfor a debt I did not cause.\u201d",
      "Her lawyer Norrawit Larlaeng said her legal team plans to request a retrial. He said that the government had already sold the leftover rice from the subsidy program for around 200 billion baht ($6.08 billion), which covers all damages estimated by the Finance Ministry.",
      "Yingluck, the first female prime minister of Thailand, came to power in 2011, five years after her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was toppled in a coup and fled abroad. Yingluck also was forced out by a military coup in 2014, and fled the country in 2017, ahead of a court verdict. She's been living in exile since then.",
      "Thaksin, a highly popular but divisive political figure, returned home in 2023 before being granted clemency in a corruption trial because of his age and health.",
      "Thailand's current Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra is Thaksin's daughter.",
      "Last year, Yingluck was cleared by a court on unrelated charges of mishandling funds for a government project in 2013. In December 2023, the court also cleared her of abuse of power in connection with a personnel transfer she had overseen.",

      "House Republicans have taken a major step forward on President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans early Thursday took a major step forward on President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, approving a legislative package that combines tax breaks, spending cuts, border security funding and other priorities.",
      "House committees labored for months on the bill, which underwent late changes to win over holdouts in the Republican conference. It exceeds 1,000 pages and is titled the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d a nod to Trump himself.",
      "Republicans made one last round of revisions before the bill reached the House floor, boosting the state and local tax deduction to win over centrists and speeding up the work requirements in Medicaid to win over those who didn\u2019t believe the bill did enough to curb spending.",
      "Here's a look at what's in the legislative package, which is expected to undergo more changes when it goes to the Senate.",
      "Republicans look to make permanent the individual income and estate tax cuts passed in Trump\u2019s first term, in 2017, plus enact promises he made on the 2024 campaign trail to not tax tips, overtime and interest on some auto loans.",
      "To partially offset the lost revenue, Republicans propose repealing or phasing out more quickly the clean energy tax credits passed during Joe Biden's presidency, helping to bring down the overall cost of the tax portion to about $3.8 trillion.",
      "The bill includes a temporary boost in the standard deduction \u2014 a $1,000 increase for individuals, bringing it to $16,000 for individual filers, and a $2,000 boost for joint filers, bringing it to $32,000. The deduction reduces the amount of income that is actually subject to income tax.",
      "There is also a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 for 2025 through 2028. It then returns to $2,000 and will increase to account for inflation.",
      "The estate tax exemption rises to $15 million and is adjusted for inflation going forward.",
      "One of the thorniest issues in negotiations had been how much to raise the state and local tax deduction, now capped at $10,000. That's been a priority of New York lawmakers. The bill increases the \u201cSALT\u201d cap to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000, with the cap phasing downward for those with higher incomes. Also, the cap and income threshold will increase 1% annually over 10 years.",
      "Several of the provisions Trump promised in the campaign would be temporary, lasting roughly through his term in office. The tax breaks for tips, overtime and car loan interest expire at the end of 2028. That's also the case for a $4,000 increase in the standard deduction for seniors.",
      "Among the various business tax provisions, small businesses, including partnerships and S corporations, will be able to subtract 23% of their qualified business income from their taxes. The deduction has been 20%",
      "Businesses will temporarily be allowed to fully expense domestic research and development costs in the year they occur and the cost of machinery, equipment and other qualifying assets. This encourages businesses to invest in ways that enhances their productivity.",
      "House Republicans would reduce spending on food aid, what is known as the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program, by about $267 billion over 10 years.",
      "States would shoulder 5% of benefit costs, beginning in fiscal 2028, and 75% of the administrative costs. Currently, states pay none of the benefit and half of the administration costs.",
      "Republicans also are expanding the work requirements to receive food aid. Under current law, able-bodied adults without dependents must fulfill work requirements until they are 54, and that would change under the bill to age 64.",
      "Also, some parents are currently exempt from work requirements until their children are 18; that would change so only those caring for a dependent child under the age of 7 are exempt.",
      "A focal point of the package is nearly $700 billion in reduced spending in the Medicaid program, according to CBO.",
      "To be eligible for Medicaid, there would be new \u201ccommunity engagement requirements\u201d of at least 80 hours per month of work, education or service for able-bodied adults without dependents. The new requirements would begin on Dec. 31, 2026. People would also have to verify their eligibility for the program twice a year, rather than just once.",
      "Republicans are looking to generate savings with new work requirements. But Democrats warn that millions of Americans will lose coverage.",
      "A preliminary estimate from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the proposals would reduce the number of people with health care by 8.6 million over the decade.",
      "Republicans are also using the package to reward allies and disadvantage political foes.",
      "The package would eliminate a $200 tax on gun silencers that has existed since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934. The elimination of the tax is supported by the NRA.",
      "The group Giffords, which works to reduce gun violence, said silencers make it more difficult to recognize the sound of gunfire and locate the source of gunshots, impairing the ability of law enforcement to respond to active shooters.",
      "Republicans are also looking to prohibit Medicaid funds from going to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion care. Democrats say defunding the organization would make it harder for millions of patients to get cancer screenings, pap tests and birth control.",
      "The bill originally called for \u201cMAGA\u201d accounts, shorthand for Trump's signature line, \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d But in a last-minute revision, the bill changed the name to \u201cTrump\u201d accounts.",
      "For parents or guardians who open new \u201cTrump\u201d accounts for their children, the federal government will contribute $1,000 for babies born between Jan. 1, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2028.",
      "Families could add $5,000 a year, with the account holders unable to take distributions before age 18. Then, they could access up to 50% of the money to pay for higher education, training and first-time home purchases. At age 30, account holders have access to the full balance of the account for any purpose.",
      "The legislation would provide $46.5 billion to revive construction of Trump\u2019s wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and more money for the deportation agenda.",
      "There's $4 billion to hire an additional 3,000 new Border Patrol agents as well as 5,000 new customs officers, and $2.1 billion for signing and retention bonuses. There's also funds for 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.",
      "It includes major changes to immigration policy, imposing a $1,000 fee on migrants seeking asylum \u2014 something the nation has never done, putting it on par with few others, including Australia and Iran.",
      "Overall, the plan is to remove 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers.",
      "There's also nearly with $150 billion in new money for the Defense Department and national security.",
      "It would provide $25 billion for Trump's \u201cGolden Dome for America,\u201d a long-envisioned missile defense shield, $21 billion to restock the nation's ammunition arsenal, $34 billion to expand the naval fleet with more shipbuilding and some $5 billion for border security.",
      "It also includes $9 billion for servicemember quality of life-related issues, including housing, health care and special pay.",
      "A wholesale revamping of the student loan program is key to the legislation, providing $330 billion in budget cuts and savings.",
      "The proposal would replace all existing student loan repayment plans with just two: a standard option with monthly payments spread out over 10 to 25 years and a \u201crepayment assistance\u201d plan that is generally less generous than those it would replace.",
      "Among other changes, the bill would repeal Biden-era regulations that made it easier for borrowers to get loans canceled if their colleges defrauded them or closed suddenly.",
      "There would be a tax increase, up to 21%, on some university endowments.",
      "To generate revenue, one section would allow increased leasing of public lands for drilling, mining and logging while clearing the path for more development by speeding up government approvals.",
      "Royalty rates paid by companies to extract oil, gas and coal would be cut, reversing Biden\u2019s attempts to curb fossil fuels to help address climate change.",

      "The Office for National Statistics said the figure stood at an estimated 431,000 in the year, down 49.9% from 860,000 a year earlier. That's the biggest percentage decline since the height of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, and the largest numerical drop for any 12-month period.",
      "Britain has relied on people coming into the country legally to contribute to economic growth, certainly in the decades after World War II, when millions arrived to help rebuild the country. And for years, it wasn't much of a political issue and on the periphery of debate.",
      "But it has become a politically toxic issue over the past 20 years or so, and played a key role in the Brexit vote of 2016, when Britain voted to leave the European Union. Membership of the EU comes with the obligation to offer free movement to all citizens of the 27-country bloc.",
      "But immigration figures have gone up, not down, post-Brexit.",
      "The anti-immigration party Reform U.K. won big in recent local elections and is ahead in many opinion polls. Its argument is that too-high immigration is impacting on public services, housing and societal cohesion as a whole.",
      "The figures released Thursday do not include those arriving in the U.K. by unauthorized means to seek asylum, many in flimsy, small boats across the English Channel. Though that number is far lower \u2014 some 37,000 people crossed the English Channel on small boats last year \u2014 it's amplified the heat surrounding the debate.",
      "A more detailed look at Thursday's figures shows that the biggest contributor to the fall was a sharp decline in immigration, with the number of people coming into the U.K. below 1 million for the first time in around three years. However, the statistics agency also found that emigration swelled back to 2017 levels.",
      "The number of arrivals in the U.K. surged from 2022 onward, driven by many factors, including the more than 200,000 people fleeing Russia's war in Ukraine and more than 150,000 from Hong Kong on special overseas visas.",
      "The period covered by the latest estimates follows the introduction in early 2024 by the then Conservative government of restrictions on people eligible to travel to the U.K. on work or study visas. Though the Conservatives, now the main opposition party, have sought to claim credit for the decline, one of the main reasons they were swept from power after 14 years was the increase in net migration levels to record highs.",
      "In August, weeks after the Labour government took office, the country was convulsed by anti-immigration riots in which mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers were attacked.",
      "Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer is seeking to get net migration levels down further and earlier this month set out a series of measures aimed at reducing further the number of people moving long term to the U.K.",

      "His plan includes reforming work and study visas and requiring a higher level of English across all immigration routes. Experts think that could reduce the number by a further 100,000 a year.",

      "The civil war in Myanmar, maritime disputes in the South China Sea and U.S. tariff hikes will top the agenda of a two-day Southeast Asian summit next week",
      "PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia -- The civil war in Myanmar, maritime disputes in the South China Sea and U.S. tariff hikes will top the agenda of a two-day Southeast Asian summit next week, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said.",
      "The meeting in Malaysia, the current chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, on Monday will be followed by a summit on Tuesday with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and leaders from the Gulf Cooperation Council comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The GCC already has strong links with the U.S. and \u201cwants to be close to China too,\u201d Anwar said. \u201cWe want to have that synergy to enhance trade investments, more effective collaboration,\u201d Anwar said in a media briefing late Wednesday.",
      "ASEAN countries, many which rely on exports to the U.S., have been hit by U.S. tariffs ranging from 10% to 49%. U.S. President Donald Trump last month announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs, prompting countries including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam to swiftly begin trade negotiations with Washington.",
      "Anwar said the U.S. has promised to review Malaysia's case \u201csympathetically.\u201d He said ASEAN is also working together to see how it can negotiate with the U.S. as a bloc. At the same time, he said that ASEAN must build its economic resilience by deepening links with other partners such as China, India and the European Union.",
      "Anwar said the U.S.-China rivalry would not split the bloc as the region continues to engage both superpowers. He also downplayed territorial disputes between ASEAN members and China in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety, and Myanmar's conflict since the 2021 military takeover.",
      "Anwar met last month with Myanmar military chief Gen. Ming Aung Hlaing in Bangkok and held virtual talks with the opposition National Unity Government. Even though the talks were focused on humanitarian aid following a devastating earthquake in March that killed more than 3,700 people, Anwar said he hopes they could eventually push a peace process forward.",
      "Min Aung Hlaing has been barred from attending ASEAN meetings after the military refused to comply with ASEAN\u2019s peace plan, which includes delivery of humanitarian aid and negotiations. Opponents and critics of the military government say aid is not freely allowed into areas not under the army\u2019s control, and accuse the army of violating its self-declared ceasefire with dozens of airstrikes.",

      "But Thursday night\u2019s dinner for the 220 biggest investors in the $TRUMP meme coin has raised uncomfortable questions about potentially shadowy buyers using the anonymity of the internet to buy access to the president.",
      "While Democrats charge that Trump is using the power of the presidency to boost profits for his family business, even some pro-Trump crypto enthusiasts worry that the president\u2019s push into meme coins isn't helping their efforts to establish the credibility, stability and legitimacy they had thought his administration would bring to their businesses.",
      "After feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, the industry has quickly become a dominant political force, donating huge sums to help Trump and crypto-friendly lawmakers. But that's also served to tether the industry \u2014 sometimes uncomfortably \u2014 to a president who is using crypto as a platform to make money for his brand in unprecedented ways.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s distasteful and an unnecessary distraction,\u201d said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter and partner at the crypto investment firm Castle Island Ventures, who said the president is \u201chugging us to death\u201d with his private crypto businesses. \u201cWe would much rather that he passes common-sense legislation and leave it at that.\u201d",
      "At the swanky Crypto Ball held down the street from the White House three days before he took office on Jan. 20, Trump announced the creation of the meme coin $TRUMP as a way for his supporters to \u201chave fun.\u201d",
      "Meme coins are the crypto sector\u2019s black sheep. They are often created as a joke, with no real utility and prone to extremely wild price swings that tend to enrich a small group of insiders at the expense of less sophisticated investors.",
      "The president's meme coin is different, however, and has a clear utility: access to Trump. The top 25 investors of $TRUMP are set to attend a private reception with the president Thursday, with the top four getting $100,000 crypto-themed and Trump-branded watches.",
      "Trump\u2019s meme coin saw an initial spike in value, followed by a steep drop. The price saw a significant increase after the dinner contest was announced. Its creators, which include an entity controlled by the Trump Organization, have made hundreds of millions of dollars by collecting fees on trades.",
      "First lady Melania Trump has her own meme coin, and Trump\u2019s sons, Eric and Don Jr. \u2014 who are running the Trump Organization while their father is president \u2014 announced they are partnering with an existing firm to create a crypto mining company.",
      "The Trump family also holds about a 60% stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that provides yet another avenue where investors are buying in and enriching the president\u2019s relatives. World Liberty has launched its own stablecoin, USD1. The project got a boost recently when World Liberty announced an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s becoming a salesman-in-chief,\u201d said James Thurber, an American University professor emeritus who has long studied and taught about corruption around the world. \u201cIt allows for foreign influence easily. It allows for crypto lobbying going on at this dinner, and other ways. It allows for huge conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big crypto fan,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One during last week\u2019s trip to the Middle East. \u201cI\u2019ve been that from the beginning, right from the campaign.\u201d",
      "That wasn\u2019t always true. During his first term, Trump posted in July 2019 that cryptocurrencies were \u201cnot money\u201d and had value that was \u201chighly volatile and based on thin air.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade,\u201d he added then. Even after leaving office in 2021, Trump told Fox Business Network that bitcoin, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency, \u201cseems like a scam.\u201d",
      "Trump began to shift during a crypto event at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in May 2024, receiving assurances that industry backers would spend lavishly to get him reelected. Another major milestone came last June, when Trump attended a high-dollar fundraiser at the San Francisco home of David Sacks.",
      "He further warmed to the industry weeks later, when Trump met at Mar-a-Lago with bitcoin miners. The following month, he addressed a major crypto conference in Nashville, promising to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet.\u201d",
      "Those close to Trump, including his sons and billionaire Elon Musk, helped further push his embrace of the industry. Sacks is now the Trump administration\u2019s crypto czar, and many Cabinet members \u2014 including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 have long been enthusiastic crypto boosters.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have faith in the dollar,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a 2023 interview. \u201cI\u2019m bullish on bitcoin.\u201d",
      "Many top crypto backers were naturally wary of traditional politics, but gravitated toward Trump last year. They bristled at Democratic President Joe Biden 's Securities and Exchange Commission aggressively bringing civil suits against several major crypto companies.",
      "Since Trump took office, many such cases have been dropped or paused, including one alleging that Justin Sun, a China-born crypto entrepreneur, and his company engaged in market manipulation and paid celebrities for undisclosed promotions.",
      "Sun, who once paid $6.2 million for a piece of art involving a banana taped to a wall, and then ate the banana, helped the Trumps start World Liberty Financial with an early $75 million investment.",
      "Sun has disclosed on social media that he is the biggest holder of $TRUMP meme coins and is attending Thursday\u2019s dinner.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry,\u201d Sun said.",
      "Trump has signed executive orders promoting the industry, including calls to create a government bitcoin reserve. In March, Trump convened the first cryptocurrency summit at the White House.",
      "But some of the industry\u2019s biggest names, often brash and outspoken, have kept mostly mum on Trump\u2019s meme coins and other projects.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to really comment on President Trump\u2019s activity,\u201d Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said at a recent public event.",
      "Meanwhile, a top legislative priority for crypto-backers, a bill clarifying how digital assets are to be regulated, has advanced in the Senate. But some Democrats have tried to stall other pro-crypto legislation over the president's personal dealings.",
      "\u201cNever in American history has a sitting president so blatantly violated the ethics laws,\u201d Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts said during a contentious House hearing earlier this month.",
      "The White House referred questions about dinner attendees to the Trump Organization, which didn't provide a list of who is coming.",

      "It\u2019s crunch time for the maker of Levi\u2019s and Wrangler jeans in Kenya\u2019s capital",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- It's crunch time for the maker of Levi's and Wrangler jeans in Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi. Hundreds of sewing machines whir in a crowded, air-conditioned factory. On another floor, workers pack clothes destined for the U.S. market.",
      "The fate of about 16,000 workers in the factory at the United Aryan export processing zone hangs in the balance. In September, a duty-free trade agreement between Kenya and the United States could expire under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, or AGOA.",
      "The factory's founder, Pankaj Bedi, said manufacturers would be unable to compete well in the U.S. market if the AGOA agreement is not renewed, due to the difficult business environment in sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Without AGOA \u2014 meant to benefit African nations that meet certain U.S. expectations in areas including governance and human rights \u2014 many Kenyan goods would no longer have duty-free access to the U.S. market. And they would be exposed to the uncertainty of the Trump administration\u2019s global tariff campaign.",
      "It's a concern across the continent. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking to journalists after his Oval Office meeting with President Donald Trump, noted that AGOA is \u201cgoing to be further discussed ... it is top of mind for them as well\u201d in the U.S. administration.",
      "Bedi said his business has benefited from 25 years of the AGOA agreement but will not survive if the deal is not extended again.",
      "\u201cThis time around, we are hoping that President Trump will pass it for a longer period, then a long-term strategy can come in play,\" he said. The longest extension has been for a decade.",
      "In making his pitch, Bedi said he believes that Africa offers the perfect alternative sourcing to Asia with its large and youthful workforce. Seventy percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa are under 30, according to the United Nations.",
      "\u201cI think the real shift of supply chain will happen, and Africa is the last frontier. We cannot go to the moon and start manufacturing there,\" Bedi said.",
      "Kenya\u2019s government would not comment on the deal or why it might be under threat.",
      "Economist Wangari Muikia said the new U.S. tariffs reflect a shift towards reviving American manufacturing, \u201cconsistent with Trump\u2019s priority to re-shore jobs,\u201d but warned that ending AGOA may \u201cstrain diplomatic ties and weaken American soft power.\u201d",
      "African governments have promoted AGOA as a major job creation avenue.",
      "In Kenya, AGOA has led to the creation of 66,000 jobs since the program began in 2000, according to government statistics published in 2024. Kenya\u2019s overall unemployment rate is 12.7%, but the rate among those under 35 is 67% \u2014 part of a wider issue for much of Africa\u2019s booming young population.",
      "In 2023, Kenya\u2019s total exports under AGOA including agricultural products, apparel and handicrafts were worth $510 million, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. United Aryan said it exports an average of 8 million jeans annually from Kenya to the U.S.",
      "But some African governments and leaders have objected to AGOA's conditions. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni criticized the program after it was used in 2023 to pressure him on his stance on homosexuality.",
      "Kenya\u2019s former ambassador to the U.N., Martin Kimani, said in an interview with The Associated Press that he believes AGOA\u2019s unpredictability has not been good for the economy.",
      "\u201cThe real measure of a trade regime is its predictability and its integration into long-term production,\" he said. \u201cThe tariffs and the program\u2019s upcoming expiration signal that AGOA is not a stable foundation for African industrial growth.\u201d",
      "If Kenya\u2019s AGOA deal isn\u2019t extended, the country will need to look for alternative markets like the African Continental Free Trade Area to ensure jobs are not lost and manufacturers keep exporting goods, said economist James Shikwati, founder and director of The Inter Region Economic Network.",
      "The continental free trade area has shortcomings that include underdeveloped infrastructure that makes it expensive to transport goods, mistrust that makes it hard for some countries to be fully open to trading with neighbors and a lack of strong institutions that can mediate trade disputes.",
      "Judging by the Trump administration\u2019s recent trade-related policies, every trade partner will need to reevaluate its engagement with the U.S., Shikwati added.",
      "For those whose jobs could be affected, there is concern.",
      "United Aryan employee Valdes Samora hopes to keep the sewing machines humming, and that livelihoods will not be lost after September.",

The work requirement had been set to begin on Jan. 1, 2029.

      "\u2014 The revised bill quadruples the cap on the state and local tax deduction to $40,000 for households with incomes up to $500,000, with the deduction gradually phasing down for taxpayers above that income threshold. Also, the cap and income threshold will increase 1% annually over 10 years, which is generally below the rate of inflation. Increasing what is known as the SALT cap was a big issue that divided the Republican conference. The current cap is $10,000. GOP leaders agreed to a higher amount to win over support from Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California.",

      "Senate Republicans have voted to establish a new precedent that will allow them to roll back clean air standards in California, including a rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Wednesday voted to establish a new precedent that will allow them to roll back vehicle emission standards in California, including a rule phasing out the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035.",
      "The winding series of Senate procedural votes that went late into the evening could have profound implications for California\u2019s longstanding efforts to reduce air pollution. It also established a new, narrow exception to the Senate filibuster even as Republicans have insisted that they won\u2019t try to change Senate rules.",
      "Democrats strongly objected to the move, delaying the votes for hours as Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., cleared the way procedurally for Republicans to bring up three House-passed resolutions that would block the rules. The Senate could pass the resolutions later this week.",
      "At issue are the three California rules \u2014 phasing out gas-powered cars, cutting tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and curbing smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",
      "Republicans say the phase out of gas-powered cars, along with the other rules, is costly for consumers and manufacturers, puts pressure on the nation\u2019s energy grid and has become a de facto nationwide electric vehicle mandate. Democrats charge that Republicans are acting at the behest of the oil and gas industry and say that California should be able to set its own standards after obtaining waivers from the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Thune said this week that the waivers \u201cgo far beyond the scope Congress contemplated in the Clean Air Act\u201d and said they \u201cendanger consumers, our economy and our nation\u2019s energy supply.\u201d",
      "Also at issue is the Senate as an institution, and longstanding filibuster rules that both parties have rolled back over the last two decades. While the Republicans\u2019 effort is narrow, it is one of several increasingly partisan efforts to push legislation through the Senate on party-line votes.",
      "Through the series of votes Wednesday, Republicans set precedent for the Senate to reject the state EPA waivers with a simple majority vote. They made that move even after the Senate parliamentarian agreed with the Government Accountability Office that California\u2019s policies are not subject to the Congressional Review Act, a law that allows Congress to reject federal regulations under certain circumstances.",
      "\u201cRepublicans tonight cross a point of no return for the Senate, expanding what this chamber can do at a majority threshold,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor as he moved to delay the votes. He called the Republicans \u201cfair-weather institutionalists.\u201d",
      "Both parties have made major moves to roll back the filibuster \u2014 which requires a 60-vote threshold \u2014 in recent years.",
      "Democrats voted in 2013, under President Barack Obama, to lower the vote threshold to a simple majority for all presidential nominees, with the exception of the Supreme Court. In 2017, during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, Republicans rolled back the remaining filibuster rules to confirm Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, a rule that Democrats maintained in confirming Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022. That same year, Democrats unsuccessfully attempted to roll back the legislative filibuster but were thwarted by some in their own party who opposed the move.",
      "Republicans have argued this week that they are simply reinforcing Senate rules, and federal laws, that are already in place.",
      "\u201cWe are not talking about doing anything to erode the institutional character of the Senate; in fact, we are talking about preserving the Senate\u2019s prerogatives,\" Thune said.",
      "The votes to roll back California standards come after years of Republican efforts to block them. The Trump administration in 2019 revoked California\u2019s ability to enforce its own emissions standards, but President Joe Biden later restored the state\u2019s authority.",
      "Republicans have argued that the rules effectively dictate standards for the whole country, imposing what would eventually be a nationwide electric vehicle mandate. Around a dozen states have already followed California\u2019s lead.",
      "California for decades has been given the authority to adopt vehicle emissions standards that are stricter than the federal government\u2019s. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced plans in 2020 to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles within 15 years as part of an aggressive effort to lower emissions from the transportation sector. Plug-in hybrids and used gas cars could still be sold.",
      "The Biden administration approved the state\u2019s waiver to implement the standards in December, a month before Trump returned to office. The California rules are stricter than a Biden-era rule that tightens emissions standards but does not require sales of electric vehicles.",
      "Biden\u2019s EPA said in announcing the decision that opponents of the California waivers did not meet their legal burden to show how either the EV rule or a separate measure on heavy-duty vehicles was inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.",
      "Newsom has evoked Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, who signed landmark environmental laws, as he has fought congressional Republicans and the Trump administration on the issue.",
      "\u201cThe United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,\u201d he said this week.",

      "Asian shares have followed Wall Street lower after shares slumped under pressure from the bond market due to worries over U.S. debt",
      "TOKYO -- Asian shares fell Thursday after Wall Street slumped under pressure from the Treasury bond market and worries about surging U.S. debt.",
      "U.S. futures were little changed, while Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 shed 1.0% in afternoon trading to 36,944.55.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng lost 0.9% to 23,615.21, while the Shanghai Composite edged down 0.1% to 3,383.10.",
      "Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.5% to 8,342.80. South Korea's Kospi dropped 1.1% to 2,595.69.",
      "Rising yields for U.S. Treasury bonds are a canary in the coal mine, Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. still has the biggest markets, the deepest liquidity, and the dollar\u2019s inertia working in its favor. But even inertia can\u2019t outrun compound interest and structural deficits forever,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The declining U.S. dollar also weighed on regional markets, according to some analysts, because some Asian nations have significant holdings in dollars.",
      "A weak dollar also hurts Asian exporters, such as Japanese automakers and electronics companies, by reducing the value of their overseas earnings when they are converted into yen.",
      "In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 143.27 Japanese yen from 143.68 yen. It had been trading at 150 yen levels a year ago. The euro cost $1.1335, up from $1.1330.",
      "Investors remain worried over President Donald Trump's actions, including tariff policies that directly affect Asian companies and decisions on major legislation such as a funding bill now in Congress.",
      "\u201cU.S. equities slumped in a \u2018Sell America\u2019 move as things turned ugly on Trump\u2019s \u2018big, beautiful tax bill.\u2019 \u201d said Tan Jing Yi, analyst at Mizuho Bank in Singapore.",
      "On Wednesday, shares tumbled on Wall Street after the U.S. government released the results for its latest auction of 20-year bonds.",
      "The government regularly sells such bonds, which is how it borrows money to pay its bills. In this auction, the U.S. government had to pay a yield as high as 5.047% to attract enough buyers to lend it a total of $16 billion over 20 years.",
      "That helped push up yields for all kinds of other Treasurys, including the more widely followed 10-year Treasury. Its yield climbed to 4.59% from 4.48% late Tuesday and from just 4.01% early last month. That\u2019s a notable move in the bond market.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 1.6% for a second straight drop  after breaking a six-day winning streak, closing at 5,844.61.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.9% to 41,860.44, while the Nasdaq composite sank 1.4% to 18,872.64.",
      "Stocks had been drifting only modestly lower early in the day, after Target and other retailers gave mixed forecasts for upcoming profits amid uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war.",
      "Treasury yields have been on the rise in part because of concerns  that the tax cuts currently under consideration  in Washington could pile trillions of more dollars onto the U.S. government\u2019s debt.",
      "Bond yields have been on the rise recently for developed economies around the world as governments borrow more to pay their bills while central banks like the Federal Reserve have cut back on their own holdings of government bonds.",
      "When the U.S. government has to pay more interest to borrow money, that can push interest rates higher for U.S. households and businesses too, including for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.",
      "That in turn can slow the economy. Higher yields can also make investors less inclined to pay high prices for stocks and other kinds of investments.",
      "A growing number of companies have recently said tariffs and uncertainty about the economy are making it difficult to guess what the upcoming year will bring. Others, including Walmart, have said they\u2019ll have to raise prices to offset Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "U.S. stocks had recently recovered most of their steep losses from earlier in the year after Trump delayed or rolled back many of his stiff tariffs. Investors are hopeful that Trump will lower his tariffs more permanently after reaching trade deals with other countries.",
      "In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 11 cents to $61.68 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 5 cents to $64.96 a barrel.",

      "Tech and music industry leaders testified about the dangers of deepfakes made with artificial intelligence on Wednesday, urging lawmakers to pass legislation that would protect people's voices and likenesses from being replicated without consent, while allowing use of the tech responsibly.",
      "Speaking to members of the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on privacy, technology, and the law, executives from YouTube and Recording Industry Association of America as well as country music singer Martina McBride, championed the bipartisan No Fakes Act, which seeks to create federal protections for artists\u2019 voice, likeness and image from unauthorized AI-generated deepfakes.",
      "The group argued that Americans across the board \u2014 whether teenagers or high-profile music artists \u2014 were at risk of their likenesses being misused. The legislation, reintroduced in the senate last month, would combat deepfakes by holding individuals or companies liable if they produced an unauthorized digital replica of an individual in a performance.",
      "\u201cAI technology is amazing and can be used for so many wonderful purposes,\u201d McBride told the panel. \u201cBut like all great technologies, it can also be abused, in this case by stealing people\u2019s voices and likenesses to scare and defraud families, manipulate the images of young girls in ways that are shocking to say the least, impersonate government officials, or make phony recordings posing as artists like me.\u201d",
      "The No Fakes Act would also hold platforms liable if they knew a replica was not authorized, while excluding certain digital replicas from coverage based on First Amendment protections. It would also establish a notice-and-takedown process so victims of unauthorized deepfakes \u201chave an avenue to get online platforms to take down the deepfake,\u201d the bill's sponsors said last month.",
      "The bill would address the use of non-consensual digital replicas in audiovisual works, images, or sound recordings.",
      "Nearly 400 artists, actors and performers have signed on in support of the legislation, according to the Human Artistry Campaign, which advocates for responsible AI use, including LeAnn Rimes, Bette Midler, Missy Elliott, Scarlett Johansson and Sean Astin.",
      "The testimony comes two days after President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act, bipartisan legislation that enacted stricter penalties for the distribution of non-consensual intimate imagery, sometimes called \u201crevenge porn,\u201d as well as deepfakes created by AI.",
      "Mitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA, said that the No Fakes act is \u201cthe perfect next step to build on\u201d that law.",
      "\u201cIt provides a remedy to victims of invasive harms that go beyond the intimate images addressed by that legislation, protecting artists like Martina from non-consensual deepfakes and voice clones that breach the trust she has built with millions of fans,\u201d he said, adding that it \u201cempowers individuals to have unlawful deepfakes removed as soon as a platform is able without requiring anyone to hire lawyers or go to court.\u201d",
      "Suzana Carlos, head of music policy at YouTube, added that the bill would protect the credibility of online content. AI regulation should not penalize companies for providing tools that can be used for permitted and non-permitted uses, she said in written testimony, prior to addressing the subcommittee.",
      "The legislation offers a workable, tech-neutral and comprehensive legal solution, she said, and would streamline global operations for platforms like YouTube while empowering musicians and rights holders to manage their IP. Platforms have a responsibility to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content, she added.",
      "\u201cYouTube largely supports this bill because we see the incredible opportunity to of AI, but we also recognize those harms, and we believe that AI needs to be deployed responsibly,\u201d she said.",

      "Short-term lender Klarna says more customers are having trouble repaying their \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d loans",
      "NEW YORK -- More Klarna customers are having trouble repaying their \u201cbuy now, pay later\" loans, the short-term lender said this week. The disclosure corresponded with reports by lending platforms Bankrate and LendingTree, which cited an increasing share of all \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d users saying they had fallen behind on payments.",
      "The late or missed installments are a sign of faltering financial health among a segment of the US population, some analysts say, as the nation's total consumer debt rises to a record $18.2 trillion and the Trump administration moves to collect on federal student loans.",
      "Shoppers who opt to finance purchases through BNPL services tend to be younger than the average consumer, and a study from the Federal Reserve last year said Black and Hispanic women were especially likely to use the plans, which customers of all income levels are increasingly adopting.",
      "\u201cWhile BNPL provides credit to financially vulnerable consumers, these same consumers may be overextending themselves,\u201d the authors of the Federal Reserve study wrote. \u201cThis concern is consistent with previous research that has shown consumers spend more when BNPL is offered when checking out and that BNPL use leads to an increase in overdraft fees and credit card interest payments and fees.\"",
      "As Klarna grows its user base and revenue, the Swedish company said its first-quarter consumer credit losses rose 17% compared to the January-March period of last year, to $136 million.",
      "A company spokesperson said in a statement that the increase largely reflected the higher number of loans Klarna made year over year. The percentage of its loans at a global level that went unpaid in the first quarter grew from 0.51% in 2024 to 0.54% this year, and the company sees \u201cno sign of a weakened U.S. consumer,\u201d he said.",
      "Buy now, pay later plans generally let consumers split payments for purchases into four or fewer installments, often with a down payment at checkout. The loans are typically marketed as zero-interest, and most require no credit check or a soft credit check.",
      "BNPL providers promote the plans as a safer alternative to traditional credit cards when interest rates are high. The popularity of the deferred payment plans, and the expanding ways customers can use them, have also sparked public attention.",
      "When Klarna announced a partnership with DoorDash in March, the news led to online comments about Americans taking out loans to buy takeout food. Similar skepticism emerged when Billboard revealed that more than half of Coachella attendees used installment plans to finance their tickets to the music festival.",
      "An April report from LendingTree said about four in ten users of buy now, pay later plans said they had made late payments in the past year, up from one in three last year. According to a May report from Bankrate, about one in four users of the loans chose them because they were easier to get than traditional credit cards.",
      "The six largest BNPL providers \u2014 Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal, Sezzle, and Zip \u2014 originated about 277.3 million loans for $33.8 billion in merchandise in 2022, or an amount equal to about 1% of credit card spending that year, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The federal agency said this month it did not intend to enforce a Biden-era regulation that was designed to put more boundaries around the fintech lenders.",
      "The rule treated buy now, pay later loans like traditional credit cards under the Truth In Lending Act, requiring disclosures, refund processing, a formal dispute process and other protections.",
      "The regulation, which took effect last year, also prevented borrowers from being forced into automatic payments or charged with multiple fees for the same missed payment.",
      "The Trump administration said its non-enforcement decision came \u201cin the interest of focusing resources on supporting hard-working American taxpayers\u201d and that it would \u201cinstead keep its enforcement and supervision resources focused on pressing threats to consumers, particularly servicemen and veterans.\u201d",
      "Consumer advocates maintain that without federal oversight, customers seeking refunds or in search of clear information about BNPL fee structures and interest rates will have less legal recourse.",
      "Industry watchers point to consumers taking out loans they can't afford to pay back as a top risk of BNPL use. Without credit bureaus keeping track of the new form of credit, there are fewer safeguards and less oversight.",
      "Justine Farrell, chair of the marketing department at the University of San Diego\u2019s Knauss School of Business, said that when consumers aren't able to make loan payments on time, it worsens the economic stress they're already experiencing.",
      "\u201cConsumers\u2019 financial positions feel more spread thin than they have in a long time,\u201d said Farrell, who studies consumer behavior and BNPL services. \u201cThe cost of food is continuing to go up, on top of rent and other goods ... so consumers are taking advantage of the ability to pay for items later.\"",
      "The Consumer Federation of America and other watchdog organizations have expressed concern about the rollback of BNPL regulation as the use of the loans continues to rise.",
      "\u201cBy taking a head-in-the-sand approach to the new universe of fintech loans, the new CFPB is once again favoring Big Tech at the expense of everyday people,\u201d said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve states on Wednesday urged a federal court to strike down President Donald Trump's sweeping taxes on imports, saying he had exceeded his authority, left U.S. trade policy dependent on his whims and unleashed economic chaos.",
      "They are challenging tariffs that Trump imposed last month on most of the countries in the world in an effort to reverse America's massive and longstanding trade deficits. They are also targeting levies the president had earlier plastered on imports from Canada, China and Mexico to combat the illegal flow of immigrants and the synthetic opioids across the U.S. border.",
      "A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York on Wednesday heard arguments in the states\u2019 case. Last week, the trade court held a hearing in a similar challenge to Trump\u2019s tariffs brought by five small businesses.",
      "The court specifically deals with civil lawsuits involving international trade. Its decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington and ultimately to the Supreme Court, where the legal challenges to Trump\u2019 tariffs are widely expected to end up.",
      "At least seven lawsuits are challenging the levies, the centerpiece of Trump's trade policy.",
      "Declaring that the United States\u2019 trade deficits add up to a national emergency, Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEPPA) and rolled out 10% tariffs on many countries on April 2 \u2014 \"Liberation Day,'' he called it. He imposed stiffer \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 tariffs of up to 50% on countries that sell more goods to the United States than the U.S. sells them. (Trump later suspended those higher tariffs for 90 days.)",
      "The states argue that the emergency economic powers act does not authorize the use of tariffs. Even if it did, they say, the trade deficit does not meet the law's requirement that an emergency be triggered only by an \u201cunusual and extraordinary threat.'' The U.S. has run a trade deficit with the rest of the world for 49 consecutive years. \u201cThis is not an unusual problem,\u2019\u2019 Brian Marshall, an Oregon state attorney, told the judges Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration argues that courts approved President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the language used in IEPPA.",
      "Brett Shumate, the assistant U.S. attorney general representing the administration, argued Wednesday that only Congress, and not the courts, can determine the \u201cpolitical'' question of whether the president's rationale for declaring an emergency complies with the law. That argument led Judge Jane Restani to ask if courts were helpless to block the president's emergency declarations no matter how \u201dcrazy'' they were.",
      "Trump's Liberation Day tariffs shook global financial markets and led many economists to downgrade the outlook for U.S. economic growth. So far, though, the tariffs appear to have had little impact on the world's largest economy.",
      "The 12 states pursuing the case are Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont.",

      "That means they are starting to get more points from other players. Dallas won three of those games, including the second-round finale over top-seeded Winnipeg in Game 6, then the opener in the Western Conference final rematch with Edmonton after a franchise playoff-record five goals in the third period. Three of those came on power plays.",
      "\u201cEveryone was talking about our lack of secondary scoring. The last round ... none of our guys were going to have big numbers in the Winnipeg series,\u201d said coach Pete DeBoer, noting the Jets being the league's top defensive team. \u201cI really felt confident that they were going to get going because even in that Winnipeg series, particularly late in that series, Game 6, I started to see some real signs of creating some real chances ... signs we were going to get some production.\"",
      "The Stars certainly got some chances and production late in the 6-3 victory over Edmonton in Game 1 on Wednesday night. They have the opportunity Friday night to take a 2-0 lead for the first time in 12 playoff series since 2020.",
      "Dallas overcame a multigoal deficit in the third period and won in regulation for the second time this postseason, becoming the first NHL team ever to do that in the same postseason. The Stars' other late comeback was in the first round against Colorado, when Rantanen had a hat trick as part of a four-point third period in Game 7 against his former team.",
      "Matt Duchene finally got his first goal of these playoffs. His tiebreaker against the Oilers was the third consecutive power-play goal in the first six minutes of the third period for Dallas, which was 0 for 14 with a man advantage in a six-game series loss last year.",
      "Esa Lindell also got his first goal. So did Miro Heiskanen, though the standout defenseman played for only the fourth time since Jan. 28. He missed the final 32 regular-season games and first 10 in the playoffs because of left knee surgery.",
      "\u201cReally good for 40 (minutes) and really bad for 20. Ultimately, that\u2019s what it came down to,\u201d Edmonton center Connor McDavid said Thursday. \u201cWhere it got away from us, obviously (was) the kill. A two-goal lead in the third, we take a couple penalties, and we\u2019ve got to find a way to get a kill.\u201d",
      "While the Oilers certainly never anticipated to again keep Dallas completely off the board with a man advantage in another long series, they sure didn't expect to give up three in such quick order.",
      "\u201cThe more time you defend, the more time you\u2019re in a position to take penalties,\u201d Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch said. \u201cWhen they push, you\u2019re in a position to defend, and you\u2019re getting vulnerable to having to take a stick infraction or any kind of infraction. ... They're a good team 5-on-5, exceptionally well on the power play. We have to make adjustments to one, get better on the penalty kill, but also giving them fewer opportunities.\"",
      "Rantanen remains the NHL leader this postseason with his nine goals and 20 points, even with only two assists in the past four games.",
      "That followed a remarkable run when he had a part in an NHL-playoff record 13 consecutive goals for a team. He had back-to-back games with four-point periods against Colorado, his former team, then had another three-goal game in the second-round opener against the Jets.",
      "Leon Draisaitl (six goals) and Connor McDavid (three goals), the 100-point teammates in the regular season, both have 19 points in the playoffs. Draisaitl had a goal and two assists in Game 1 against the Stars, while McDavid had two assists.",

      "GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- It would be tough to top the month Florida coach Todd Golden has enjoyed since winning the national championship.",
      "Golden and the Gators visited the White House on Wednesday, a trip that included an invitation to the Oval Office. He landed one of the top guards in the transfer portal, Arkansas\u2019 Boogie Fland. He threw out the first pitch at a Chicago Cubs game. He received the Winged Foot Award at the New York Athletic Club \u2014 along with a yearlong membership to the famed golf club. And he signed a six-year, $40.5 million contract extension.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d Golden said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s been really awesome getting a lot of these rewards and opportunities because we won. We want to take advantage of it. There\u2019s no guarantee that you\u2019ll ever get this opportunity again. We\u2019re very mindful of that, how hard it is.\u201d",
      "The whirlwind started when Florida rallied from a 12-point deficit in the second half to shock Houston 65-63 in San Antonio on April 7. Golden quickly started to reshape Florida\u2019s roster to replace his entire starting backcourt: Walter Clayton Jr., Alijah Martin and Will Richard.",
      "He landed Princeton\u2019s Xaivian Lee, a 6-foot-4 Toronto native who averaged 16.9 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.5 assists a game last season. He added guard AJ Brown from Ohio University a week later.",
      "But the biggest addition came Tuesday, when Fland signed paperwork to play for the Gators. Fland essentially replaces Denzel Aberdeen, who was expected to step into a starting role but left Florida for Kentucky.",
      "Fland averaged 13.5 points, 5.1 assists, 3.2 rebounds and 1.5 steals for the Razorbacks last season. The freshman from New York averaged nearly 32 minutes a game.",
      "Now, Lee and Fland will be paired together in an offense that could be even more diverse than the one that set the top two scoring marks in school history the last two years behind Clayton.",
      "\u201cI see it working really, really well,\u201d Golden said. \u201cWhen you have two point guards that are out there making plays, I think it makes your offense really dynamic. So we\u2019re excited. \u2026 They\u2019re both going to have the ball in their hands a ton, being able to play out of the ball screen, being able to push in transition, weapons that teams are going to have to account for.\u201d",
      "With most of Florida\u2019s frontcourt returning \u2014 Golden is \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d Alex Condon will be back after going through the NBA's pre-draft process \u2014 the Gators should be a popular pick to repeat as champs.",
      "\u201cOnce we get this new group together, we\u2019ll obviously kind of keep this past season\u2019s success in the equation because we want to try to continue our program at that level,\u201d Golden said. \u201cBut this new group will have a lot to live up to.\u201d",
      "The Gators will reconvene in Gainesville for summer workouts beginning June 9.",
      "Their trip to the White House was the final gathering for the group. Florida flew players, coaches and staff on a 30-person charter to Washington, D.C., and arranged to have everyone else meet them in the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "Clayton traveled from California. Olivier Rioux, the world\u2019s tallest teenager at 7 feet, 9 inches, made the trip from Canada. Both guys who transferred \u2014 Aberdeen and Indiana\u2019s Sam Alexis \u2014 also rejoined the team along with former assistant coaches Kevin Hovde (now Columbia\u2019s head coach) and John Andrzejek (now Campbell\u2019s head coach). Each of them got their picture taken with President Trump.",
      "\u201cThat was something, again, that these guys will have the rest of their lives,\u201d Golden said.",
      "The 39-year-old Golden probably won\u2019t be in Gainesville for the rest of his career, but he made it clear he has no plans to leave for the NBA \u201canytime soon\u201d despite his new contract including a much lower buyout if he leaves for the pros.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s more of just kind of keeping that opportunity potentially available down the road,\u201d he said. \u201cThese contracts, it\u2019s like real-life stuff, so you got to make sure that you give yourself a little bit of opportunity.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the college game, I\u2019m here at Florida for a long time. It\u2019s everything I need, everything my family needs.\u201d",

      "CHICAGO -- The Chicago Blackhawks hired Jeff Blashill on Thursday, giving him a second chance to prove himself as a head coach in the NHL.",
      "Blashill, a 51-year-old Michigan native, coached the Detroit Red Wings for seven seasons. He was let go after the team went 32-40-10 during the 2021-22 season.",
      "While Blashill had an underwhelming stay with Detroit, finishing with a 204-261-72 record, he has a player development background that likely was appealing for the rebuilding Blackhawks. He has coached in the AHL and USHL, along with the college ranks.",
      "Blashill, a former college goaltender for Ferris State, spent the last three seasons as an assistant to Jon Cooper with the Tampa Bay Lightning.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s thrived when in a position to develop young players and has shown he\u2019s capable of blending that into overall team success, a vision and philosophy we share for where we are today and where we see our team in the future,\" general manager Kyle Davidson said in a release. \"We couldn\u2019t be more excited for what\u2019s to come under Jeff\u2019s direction.\u201d",
      "The previous four coaches for Chicago \u2014 Anders Sorensen, Luke Richardson, Derek King and Jeremy Colliton \u2014 had never been a head coach in the NHL when they got the job with the Blackhawks.",
      "Chicago went 25-46-11 this year, finishing last in the Central Division and No. 31 in the NHL for the second straight season.",
      "Davidson fired Richardson in December, and Sorensen was promoted from the minors to serve as the team\u2019s interim coach for the rest of the season.",
      "Sorensen was a candidate for the full-time job, but he is expected to remain with the franchise in some capacity.",
      "\u201cWe love Anders,\u201d Davidson said at the team\u2019s end-of-season media availability in April. \u201cHe\u2019s been part of the organization for some time. He\u2019s a great hockey mind, he\u2019s a great person and those are the type of people we want in our organization.\u201d",
      "Blashill inherits a team with the makings of what looks like a good young nucleus, led by Connor Bedard. It has two first-round selections in each of the next two drafts, to go along with salary-cap flexibility for free agency.",
      "Artyom Levshunov, Colton Dach, Sam Rinzel, Oliver Moore and Ryan Greene each made their NHL debut this year, ramping up hope for the future.",
      "But the Blackhawks averaged just 2.73 goals this season and allowed 3.56 goals per game, 31st in the NHL behind only San Jose. The team has made just one postseason appearance since 2017, and that was the expanded playoff format after the 2020 season was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Blashill steps into his new job amid preparations for the franchise\u2019s centennial 2025-26 season.",

    "story": [
      "There will be an unfamiliar uncertainty at the French Open when the year's second Grand Slam tournament begins in Paris on Sunday",
      "PARIS -- For quite some time, there's usually been a sense of certainty at the French Open.",
      "That was particularly so on the men's side, with Rafael Nadal ruling over the red clay of Roland-Garros the way no one has dominated any tournament in tennis history. He would go there, he would win nearly every match he played \u2014 how's 112-4 for a career record? \u2014 and he would head home with another trophy, 14 in all.",
      "Simultaneously simple and spectacular. So, too, albeit over a much shorter span, is Iga Swiatek's recent control over the women's event, claiming four of five championships, including the past three.",
      "And now? As play begins Sunday, things are less clear, and not just because the 38-year-old Nadal is no longer competing and will be honored that day at Court Philippe-Chatrier. The owner of 22 Grand Slam titles retired last season, playing for the final time at the Davis Cup. His final French Open ended with a loss to Alexander Zverev last May and his final Roland-Garros appearance ended with an exit in singles against Novak Djokovic at the Summer Olympics, followed by an exit in doubles alongside Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "\u201cWill it be very interesting? I think so,\u201d said Grigor Dimitrov, a quarterfinalist at last year\u2019s French Open and previously a semifinalist at the other majors. \u201cCould we see potentially some different winners and different results? Absolutely.\u201d",
      "He was speaking specifically about the men's bracket. But he could have been talking about the women, too.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s ... 20 different people that you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they end up winning the tournament,\u201d said Madison Keys, the American whose first Slam trophy arrived at the Australian Open in January. \u201cPart of it is because we\u2019ve kind of lost some of our legends, obviously. Like, there\u2019s no longer Serena Williams in every draw, where you just assume she\u2019s going to win.\"",
      "Swiatek, 23, did hold that status for a while but she's been through a trying spell since last year's triumph in Paris. Not only hasn't she lifted a trophy since then, but she hasn't reached a final \u2014 and even clay presents problems. She was eliminated by Danielle Collins in her second match at the Italian Open, after a 6-1, 6-1 loss to 2023 U.S. Open winner Coco Gauff at the Madrid Open, where she also dropped a 6-0 set to Keys.",
      "And that's to say nothing of the off-court matter of a doping case in which Swiatek essentially was cleared but did serve an oddly timed suspension.",
      "Ah, yes, doping. It's a big topic in tennis lately, in large part because of what happened with former No. 1 Swiatek \u2014 she's now down to No. 5, behind Aryna Sabalenka, Gauff, Jessica Pegula and Jasmine Paolini \u2014 and men's No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who served his own, much-scrutinized, three-month ban.",
      "The deal he worked out with the World Anti-Doping Agency after it appealed the 23-year-old Italian's original exoneration allowed Sinner to play at the Australian Open, where he earned his third title in the past five majors, then return to competition at the Italian Open, where he was the runner-up to Alcaraz.",
      "So Sinner is in the mix at the French Open, but a notch below defending champion Alcaraz, who dealt with muscle issues in both legs recently before looking in Rome like he is back to his best. Still, he's not a lock the way Nadal was, while three-time major finalist Alexander Zverev is as inconsistent as possible lately, and 24-time Slam champ Djokovic ended a three-match losing streak this week at the Geneva Open tune-up event.",
      "\u201cKind of new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. It\u2019s a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it\u2019s kind of a challenge for me, mentally, to really face these kind of sensations on the court, going out early now, regularly,\u201d Djokovic said after an opening exit in Madrid.",
      "\u201cBut that\u2019s, I guess, the circle of life and the career. Eventually, it was going to happen. ... Grand Slams is where I really want to play the best tennis,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to do that in Roland-Garros, but I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d",
      "For a change, no one can be sure what's to come in Paris.",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Roger Penske personally told Will Power about the firings of Team Penske's top three executives \u2014 a decision Power said his boss made after a sleepless night contemplating how to handle a cheating scandal ahead of the Indianapolis 500.",
      "\u201cI know it was very tough for him. He said that. He said he didn\u2019t sleep the night before because he had to make a very hard decision,\u201d Power said Thursday, one day after the shock dismissals of team president Tim Cindric, IndyCar managing director Ron Ruzewski and IndyCar general manager Kyle Moyer.",
      "Penske cleaned house after the cars for both Power and two-time defending Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden failed inspection ahead of Sunday's final round of qualifying. The cars were found to have modified a spec part \u2014 the rear attenuator is a safety part and IndyCar said it has found no evidence the Team Penske filling a seam on it provided a competitive advantage.",
      "Newgarden declined to discuss the situation Thursday.",

My goodness, I\u2019ve been enjoying being here this whole time. I look forward to it every year, as we all do. Ready to go to work with our group. Proud of everything that we have done up to this point. Ready to go racing. So that\u2019s what I got to say.\u201d",
      "It was the second major technical violation for Team Penske in just over a year. The team last year was found to have illegal access to its push-to-pass system at times the drivers should not have been able to gain the additional boost of horsepower. Newgarden was stripped of last year's season-opening victory once IndyCar discovered the team was illegally using the software.",
      "Power expressed sympathy for Penske, who owns the three-car race team, IndyCar, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500. Penske confirmed to new television partner Fox Sports that IndyCar is exploring an independent governing body that does not consist of Penske employees.",
      "\u201cI feel bad for him. He\u2019s in a very tough spot in that situation,\u201d Power said of Penske. \"You could tell it was heavy on him. Tough, tough for him to have to do that. I think Roger moves forward very quickly. He makes decisions. He moves forward. Doesn\u2019t dwell on it.",
      "\u201cStarts looking at what is absolutely best for the team and everyone to move forward. That\u2019s Roger. That\u2019s why he\u2019s so successful,\u201d Power continued. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to sit and spend a month worrying about what happened. I think he\u2019s \u2018How can we fix this and let\u2019s move forward and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u2019\u201d",
      "Team Penske earlier Thursday announced the personnel that has been adjusted for its three cars ahead of Sunday's 109th running of \u201cThe Greatest Spectacle in Racing.\u201d Penske has won the race a record 20 times.",
      "Newgarden, who is trying to become the first driver to win three consecutive Indy 500s, will have Luke Mason as his strategist and Raul Prados as lead engineer. As part of the penalties levied on the team, he was dropped to 32nd on the starting grid and no driver has ever won from the last row.",
      "\u201cYou can win this race from any seat in the house. There\u2019s no bad seat in this house,\u201d Newgarden said. \u201cI like the challenge of coming from 32nd. We do have a great car. It just seems to be getting better every year. I\u2019m trying to protect that right now. It\u2019s one of these things where every day changes a little bit at the Speedway. You have to stay on top of it. Sunday is really going to be the day that counts. We have to make sure we\u2019re in the right place for that day. If we can do that, we should be in a good spot.\u201d",
      "Scott McLaughlin, who crashed early Sunday and didn't participate in the final rounds of qualifying, will start from 12th with Ben Bretzman as his strategist and Malcolm Finch as lead engineer.",
      "Power, who is in the final year of his contract at Penske and was dropped to last in the 33-car field, will have Jonathan Diuguid as strategist and David Faustino as lead engineer.",
      "He believes Penske was forced into the firings by the external pressure from other team owners who are furious Team Penske has had major technical violations in two consecutive seasons. He also said the attenuator modification gave him no advantage and felt good people lost their jobs over the incident.",
      "Cindric had been with Penske since 2000.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a shock and a pity. They\u2019re all extremely good at their job,\u201d Power said. \u201cIt was just the pressure from outside. I guess Roger had to make a tough decision, but I can tell you these were very credible people. They really were. As you know, the infraction was very minor. It wasn\u2019t a performance gain.\u201d",

      "\u201cCraig is an inspiring and engaging leader, who brings a unique mix of executive leadership experience, deep relationships in the golf industry, and a genuine commitment to elevating women and girls through golf.\u201d",
      "Prior to his two years at the PGA of America, Kessler was CEO of Buff City Soap when it expanded from 100 to 260 stores, and he was COO of Topgolf. He also spent six years as an operating partner in private equity, first with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and later with Providence Equity.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about leading a sports organization. It\u2019s about redefining what\u2019s possible,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cThis role is deeply personal to me, not just as a professional opportunity but as a chance to make a difference in the world and create new opportunities for others.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- Carlos Alcaraz will open his defense of the French Open title against veteran Kei Nishikori and said he's \u201cexcited\u201d to be back in Paris on the back of an excellent clay-court season.",
      "Alcaraz has been the dominant player in the weeks leading to Roland-Garros and is the clear-cut favorite after claiming trophies in Barcelona and Rome. Nishikori is a former top-five player who has been struggling on the dirt in recent years.",
      "Alcaraz holds a 15-1 record on clay this season. Having moved back to No. 2 in the rankings, he can't play top-ranked Jannik Sinner before the final in Paris because they are on opposite sides of the draw.",
      "\u201cIt's been a great clay season so far,\u201d Alcaraz said after Thursday's draw in Paris. \u201cI'm excited. The confidence is really high right now.\u201d",
      "Together, Alcaraz or Sinner have won the last five Grand Slam titles.",
      "Back from his three-month doping suspension, Sinner pushed Alcaraz when they met in the Rome final this month, yet lost in straight sets. Sinner opens against local hope Arthur Rinderknech.",
      "Alcaraz beat Sinner over five sets in the French Open semifinals last year. Alcaraz then successfully defended his Wimbledon title for his fourth Grand Slam trophy. Sinner has won only one of his 19 career titles on clay, in Umag, Croatia, in 2022 \u2014 when he beat Alcaraz in the final.",
      "Novak Djokovic, who finally won a match on clay this year at the Geneva Open on Wednesday, will face Mackenzie McDonald of the United States in the first round. The 24-time Grand Slam singles champion won the Paris Olympics gold medal last August at Roland-Garros but has struggled on clay since then.",
      "Sinner could run into No. 5 seed Jack Draper in the quarterfinals, with other possible matchups featuring Alexander Zverev (3) vs. Djokovic (6), Taylor Fritz (4) vs. Lorenzo Musetti (8), and Alcaraz vs. Casper Ruud (7).",
      "In the women's draw, four-time champion Iga Swiatek is still searching for her best form.",
      "She has dropped outside the top four and has not won a title or reached a final since her victory at Roland-Garros last year. Seeded No. 5 in Paris, Swiatek will open her campaign against Rebecca Sramkova, ranked No. 41. She could meet former U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu in the second round.",
      "\u201cI'm proud of my achievements here,\u201d Swiatek said. \u201cI'm working hard to be ready. For sure this season had more ups and downs than the years before. But I know my game is here.\u201d",
      "No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka faces Kamilla Rakhimova while No. 2 Coco Gauff will take on Olivia Gadecki. An interesting matchup will pit No. 10 Paula Badosa against four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka.",
      "The possible women's quarterfinals are Sabalenka against No. 8 Qinwen Zheng, last-year's runner-up Jasmine Paolini against Swiatek, Jessica Pegula (3) vs. Mirra Andreeva (6), and Gauff against Madison Keys (7)",
      "The French Open starts on Sunday and concludes on June 8.",

      "It was a zero-sum game Tottenham won 1-0 on Wednesday: Winner goes into the Champions League \u2014 plus the UEFA Super Cup game in August \u2014 and loser is out of Europe next season and gets nothing.",
      "United lost a drab match despite, as soccer finance expert Kieran Maguire noted on Thursday, having higher revenue than Tottenham and spending 64% more on wages for a more expensively acquired squad of players. Tottenham also beat United twice in the Premier League this season, and in the domestic League Cup.",
      "\u201cIf I was teaching this at management school (I) would conclude that there is something seriously wrong with the culture of the organization \u2026 which is set by senior management,\u201d Maguire wrote on X.",
      "Beyond the loss of sporting opportunities and reputational prestige, the club owned by the Glazer family from the United States and British billionaire industrialist Jim Ratcliffe has short and longer-term financial hits ahead.",
      "No Champions League play next season is an instant loss of at least 80 million euros ($90 million), and approaching 150 million euros ($169 million) for a run deep into the knockout stage.",
      "United also misses out on the 4 million euros ($4.5 million) Tottenham will get from UEFA for playing the Super Cup against the Champions League titleholder \u2014 either Inter Milan or Paris Saint-Germain \u2014 on Aug. 13 at Udinese\u2019s stadium in Italy. The winner gets a bonus of 1 million euros ($1.1 million).",
      "After failing to qualify for the 2025 Club World Cup \u2014 which has a $1 billion prize fund from FIFA and should pay more than $100 million to a successful European team \u2014 United is now far behind in qualifying for the 2029 edition.",
      "European teams qualify for the FIFA event only by being in the Champions League, either winning the title or building consistent results over four seasons.",
      "United already will miss the entire first half of the 2024-28 qualifying period, and it is hard to project the team that last won the Premier League 12 years ago both qualifying for and then winning a Champions League title within three years.",
      "One clear solution to growing financial issues and the ability to comply with Premier League rules is selling the club\u2019s best players, like captain Bruno Fernandes and out-of-favor forward Marcus Rashford, or its homegrown prospects. Some already earn high wages which are problematic for potential buyers.",
      "A talent drain risks speeding a spiral of decline on and off the field if coach Ruben Amorim is left trying to rebuild with a weaker pool of players.",
      "While United is still one of Europe's highest-earning clubs, UEFA's annual research shows its advantage is in decline, even though revenue was a club record 661.8 million pounds ($887 million) last year.",
      "A UEFA chart showed that over five years from 2019-24 \u2014 pre-COVID-19 through to the post-pandemic recovery in the soccer industry \u2014 United\u2019s revenue grew at a slower rate than all of its biggest English rivals except Chelsea.",
      "Revenue now risks dropping, and another income cut is coming from falling to 16th in the Premier League standings with one round left on Sunday.",
      "Premier League prize money based on final position in the standings means dropping from eighth a year ago to 16th is a difference of 22 million pounds ($29.5 million) less.",
      "It all adds up to another loss-making season after a 113.2 million pounds ($152) deficit last season. The three previous years totaled losses of 236 million pounds ($316 million).",
      "The league\u2019s profit and sustainability rules (PSR) allow clubs to lose 105 million pounds ($140.7 million) over a three-year period or face sanctions, though United can cite some exemptions.",
      "Ratcliffe, who has operational control despite being a minority shareholder, is already the public face of unpopular cuts to jobs and staff benefits, and rising ticket prices for fans.",
      "\u201cThis is not sustainable,\" the club told fans in January, \"and if we do not act now we are in danger of failing to comply with PSR/FFP (financial fair play) requirements in future years and significantly impacting our ability to compete on the pitch.\u201d",
      "The club's share price was around $13.30 on the New York Stock Exchange in early trading Thursday, having dropped by about $1 during the second half of the final played in Bilbao, Spain. Shares peaked this season in December, after a 2-1 win at Manchester City, at more than $18.40.",

      "\u201cEverybody wanted me to do it like last year at some different point, but it\u2019s got to feel right and it felt right at the time,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cIf I would have known it was a 2, I would not have done it. So I might have wasted it.\u201d",
      "Miller flashed the choke signal to Knicks superfan Spike Lee while leading a rally in Game 5 of the 1994 Eastern Conference finals. The Hall of Fame guard scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to put the Pacers up 3-2 in the series, though New York rallied to win the next two games.",
      "Pacers coach Rick Carlisle wasn't worried about Haliburton inciting the crowd the way Miller loved to during the fierce rivalry of the 1990s.",
      "\u201cListen, players can do what they want and it\u2019s an emotional thing. It\u2019s not a big deal,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. We got to go out there, the place is unlikely to be any louder than it was tonight.\u201d",
      "After Haliburton scored 26 points to lead the Pacers past the Knicks last year in Game 7 of the East semifinals at MSG, he wore a sweatshirt featuring Miller's choke pose to his postgame press conference.",
      "Miller was on the crew calling the game for TNT on Wednesday. Haliburton said they communicate often and though weren't able to speak immediately after the game, they did make eye contact.",
      "\u201cDefinitely a special time, and yeah, really cool he was in the building for that,\u201d Haliburton said.",

      "Thoroughbred horses on a sprawling Kentucky farm are helping men trying to carve out clean and sober lives",
      "NICHOLASVILLE, Ky. -- Jaron Kohari never thought his path to sobriety would involve horses.",
      "The 1,000-pound animals unnerved him upon his arrival at a farm outside Lexington that teaches horsemanship to addicts, with the prospects of a job and a future if they get clean. But in short order they were making him feel content, the same emotion he used to chase with alcohol and drugs.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not used to caring for anything,\u201d said Kohari, a 36-year-old former underground coal miner from eastern Kentucky. \u201cYou\u2019re kind of selfish and these horses require your attention 24/7, so it teaches you to love something and care for it again.\"",
      "Frank Taylor\u2019s idea for the Stable Recovery program was born six years ago out of a need for help on his family\u2019s 1,100-acre farm that has foaled and raised some of racing's biggest stars in the heart of Kentucky horse country.",
      "The area is also home to America\u2019s bourbon industry and racing has long been associated with alcohol.",
      "\u201cIf a horse won, I drank a lot,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf a horse lost, I drank a lot.\u201d",
      "He believes his own consumption had contributed to a close family member\u2019s alcoholism. He quit and said he\u2019s been sober for five years.",
      "The basic framework for the program at Taylor Made Farm came from a restaurant he frequents whose owner operates it as a second-chance employment opportunity for people in recovery. Taylor thought something similar would work on his farm, given the physical labor involved in caring for horses and the peaceful atmosphere.",
      "Taylor just had to convince his three brothers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty radical idea because we\u2019re dealing with million-dollar horses and a lot of million-dollar customers and to say, \u2018Hey, I want to bring in some alcoholics, some felons, some heroin addicts, some meth addicts, whatever.\u2019 There was a laundry list of things that could go wrong,\u201d he recalled.",
      "His brothers\u2019 response?",
      "\u201cFrank, we think you\u2019re nuts.\"",
      "He reminded them the farm\u2019s mission statement includes living Christian values while serving customers and making a profit. They agreed to let him try it for 90 days, with the promise he would shut it down if anything went wrong.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s gone perfectly, but it\u2019s been so much more good than bad,\u201d Taylor said. \"The industry\u2019s really embraced it, the community around Lexington and all over the country have really embraced it, and we\u2019ve had fantastic results.\"",
      "Taylor said 110 men have successfully completed the program, which requires participants to be 30 days sober before they start.",
      "Funded by donations, Stable Recovery does no advertising. Colleagues in the racing industry contact Taylor about potential participants. Sobriety homes and judges in the area also refer men, with the program offered as an alternative to jail.",
      "It doesn\u2019t charge its participants until they start earning money once they begin working on the farm.",
      "At that point, they pay $100 a week for food, housing, clothing and transportation. They earn $10 an hour the first 90 days, then get a raise to $15 to $17 an hour.",
      "The goal is to keep men in the program for a year as opposed to other recovery programs that run for 30, 60 or 90 days.",
      "That allows bonds to form among the group, instills confidence and gives the men time to rebuild their lives and relationships with their families.",
      "But for every success story, there are some who don\u2019t last.",
      "\"They come in here and they think that they\u2019re ready and they\u2019re really not ready,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a gift of desperation to where they\u2019ve got to change and they\u2019ve hit the bottom and they have to be willing to do a lot of little stuff that\u2019s aggravating and challenging.\u201d",
      "That includes rising at 4:30 a.m., cleaning their room, keeping the public areas spotless. There are Alcoholic Anonymous meetings at 6 a.m. and work hours run from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. four days a week. Life on the farm involves grooming the horses, getting them out of their stalls and into the pastures daily, visits from veterinarians and farriers, and farm maintenance.",
      "The other days the men attend therapy offsite or visit doctors in an effort to build their sobriety. Stable Recovery partners with an outpatient treatment program that provides classes and therapists and both sides keep in constant communication.",
      "At night, the men take turns making dinner for the group and then it\u2019s lights out at 9 p.m.",
      "Always waiting for them are the horses, their big dark eyes staring from their stalls. The animals are barometers for how their human handlers are feeling each day.",
      "\u201cI think the horse is the most therapeutic animal in the world,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThere\u2019s other animals like dogs that are very good, but there\u2019s something about a horse, like Winston Churchill said, \u2018The outside of a horse is good for the inside of a man.'\"",
      "New arrivals often have nothing to be proud of and are weary of being judged by their families, their communities and the legal system. They\u2019re depressed, anxious, sometimes suicidal.",
      "\u201cBeing around a horse early in recovery, it\u2019s a difference-maker,\u201d said Christian Countzler, CEO and co-founder of Stable Recovery who said he overcame his own addictions to alcohol and drugs.",
      "\u201cWithin days of being in a barn around a horse, he\u2019s smiling, he\u2019s laughing, he\u2019s interacting with his peers. A guy that literally couldn\u2019t pick his head up and look you in the eye is already doing better,\u201d he said.",
      "Kohari said he had been in and out of treatment since he was 18, failing numerous times to kick the lure of alcohol and then heroin, fentanyl and meth, before coming to Taylor Made Farm.",
      "\u201cI was just broken,\u201d Kohari said. \u201cI just wanted something different and the day I got in this barn and started working with the horses, I felt like they were healing my soul.\u201d",
      "After completing the program, he worked at WinStar Farm before returning to Taylor Made Farm as a coordinator for a barn full of pregnant mares.",
      "Stable Recovery helps the men get a job in the industry after 90 days when they graduate from its School of Horsemanship. Participants don't have to work in the industry but the majority want to.",
      "Among other successful graduates are the sons of two racing industry veterans.",
      "Blane Servis, a recovering alcoholic, is an assistant trainer to Brad Cox in Kentucky. Servis\u2019 father, John, trained 2004 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Smarty Jones.",
      "Will Walden beat a 12-year heroin addiction to become a trainer. His father, Elliott Walden, is president and CEO of racing operations for WinStar Farm. He previously trained Victory Gallop to a win in the 1998 Belmont Stakes.",
      "Once the younger Walden, Tyler Maxwell and Mike Lowery had gotten clean, they asked Taylor to find someone to buy 10 horses so they could train them.",
      "Unable to convince anyone, Taylor talked himself into it. He purchased 10 horses at $40,000 each.",
      "\u201cI tell my wife and she\u2019s ready to kill me,\u201d he said.",
      "He upped the ante by putting in another $400,000 to care for the horses and hire Walden and the other men to train, leaving Taylor on the hook for $800,000.",
      "His wife was still upset, so he found others to buy in for $200,000.",
      "\u201cWe lost about half our money,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cbut from that all those guys stayed sober and today Will Walden has 50 horses in training.\u201d",
      "Walden\u2019s stable earned $4.2 million last year.",
      "His filly, the aptly named Bless the Broken, recently finished third in the $1 million Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs.",
      "Maxwell is an exercise rider at WinStar Farm\u2019s training center. Lowery is the divisional broodmare manager at Taylor Made.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking to get these guys sober,\u201d Taylor said, \u201cand then you can get them in spots to work where they can advance in the industry and we\u2019re seeing that happen on a daily basis.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Tyrese Haliburton was sure his jumper as regulation ended was going in, then wasn't certain it had after it bounced high off the rim and hung in the air for what felt like an eternity.",
      "He thought it was a 3-pointer to win the game, then quickly realized it was a 2 to tie. A lot to process, followed by just one thought with overtime looming.",

      "The Pacers did, finishing off their stunning rally by beating the New York Knicks 138-135 in overtime Wednesday night in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.",

      "Haliburton then hoped he had won it with another. With the Pacers down two and time running down, he started to lose control of his dribble, regained it and dribbled back out toward the 3-point line.

      "Replay confirmed that Haliburton's toe was on the line and it was a 2-pointer that tied it at 125. Andrew Nembhard eventually made the go-ahead basket with 26 seconds remaining in OT.",
      "Game 2 is Friday night.",
      "Haliburton had 31 points and 11 assists. Nesmith finished with 30 points, going 8 for 9 from 3-point range.",

      "Another round, another comeback.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always special. It\u2019s always fun,\u201d Nesmith said. \u201cThis is what we live for.\u201d",
      "It was a thrilling start to the ninth playoff matchup between these fierce rivals from the 1990s \u2014 but a deflating finish for the Knicks in their first Eastern Conference finals game since 2000.",
      "Jalen Brunson scored 43 points and Karl-Anthony Towns had 35 points and 12 rebounds. But the Knicks couldn\u2019t protect the big lead they built while Brunson was on the bench in foul trouble in the fourth quarter and had a collapse unlike any other in the postseason.",
      "Teams leading by at least 14 points in the final 2:45 of the fourth quarter had been 994-0 since detailed play-by-play began being kept in 1997-98.",
      "\u201cGive them a lot of credit. They closed the game out like they\u2019ve been doing all playoffs,\u201d Brunson said. \u201cJust not really good on our part.\u201d",
      "The Pacers beat the Knicks in Game 7 of the East semifinals at Madison Square Garden last year, routing a team that had been decimated by injuries.",
      "This was an entirely different way to win, with the Pacers looking all but out of the game after the Knicks' 14-0 run with Brunson on the bench pushed New York's two-point lead to 108-92.",
      "Even after Nesmith started to get hot, the Knicks seemed safe when Brunson's 3-pointer made it 119-105 with 2:51 to go. But Nesmith would later hit consecutive 3s and both free throws when the Knicks fouled him intentionally so he couldn't try to tie it with another, giving Indiana the chance to tie on Haliburton's shot.",

      "Stanford advanced through stroke play with a record score to win by 27 shots and was poised to win its third NCAA title in four years and become the first team to win back-to-back since the move to match play in 2017.",

      "Stanford didn't go down without a might fight.",
      "Xu, who missed a 4-foot putt to fall behind for the first time all match, answered with a 15-foot birdie on the par-3 16th and a wedge to 10 feet for birdie on the 17th to regain control. They halved the 18th hole, giving Xu a 1-up victory and team score at 2-all.",
      "It came down to the final match that Dianna Lee once had firmly in her grasp. Revuelta bogeyed the 11th and 12th holes to fall 3 down with five holes to play, But she won the 14th with a par and holed a 15-foot birdie putt on the 15th to get within one.",
      "Lee was in a back bunker, blasted out to 7 feet and missed her par putt on the 16th. Revuelta, however, pulled her 4-foot par putt to stay 1 down. On the next hole, Lee had a 12-foot birdie putt to win the match and pulled it, running it nearly 5 feet by. Miss that and the match was all square. She holed it to stay 1 up going to the 18th.",
      "The par-5 closing hole amounts to a wedge contest with a stream guarding the green. Both players had about 18 feet. Lee's uphill putt spun hard off the left lip and rolled 5 feet by. Revuelta left her downhill putt short, setting up Lee with 5 feet for the win.",
      "This time, she made it and the celebration was on for Northwestern, which had reached the final once before in 2017 before losing to Arizona State.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school\u2019s ability to enroll international students",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's administration escalated its standoff with Harvard University on Thursday, revoking the school's ability to enroll international students.",
      "The government told Harvard's thousands of current foreign students that they must transfer to other schools or they will lose their legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The move could significantly affect the university, which enrolls nearly 6,800 international students, most of them in graduate programs. Those students may now have to scramble to figure out their next steps.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security took this latest step because Harvard refused to comply with requests to produce records about its foreign students, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a letter. Noem accused Harvard of \u201cperpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies and employs racist \u2018diversity, equity and inclusion\u2019 policies.\u2019\u201d Harvard said the action is unlawful and undermines the school\u2019s research mission.",
      "Here's what to know about how this decision affects international students and what legal authority Noem has to take the step.",
      "The U.S. government has authority over who comes into the country. The Department of Homeland Security oversees which colleges are part of the Student Exchange and Visitor Program, and on Thursday it said it would remove Harvard. The program gives colleges the ability to issue documentation to foreign students admitted to the schools. Then, the students apply to obtain visas to study in the United States.",
      "Students who completed their degrees this semester will be allowed to graduate. Noem's letter said the changes would take effect for the 2025-2026 school year. Harvard's Class of 2025 is expected to graduate next week.",
      "However, students who have yet to complete their degree need to transfer to another university, Noem said, or they'll lose their legal permission to remain in the U.S.",
      "No, not unless the government changes its decision or a court steps in. For now, Noem said Harvard could restore its status as a host institution for foreign students if it complied with a list of demands within 72 hours. Those demands include requests for a range of records, such as disciplinary records for international students, plus audio and video recordings of protest activity.",
      "Harvard previously declined to provide those records. The university said Thursday it was working to provide guidance to affected students.",
      "Harvard's battle with the Trump administration dates to early April. The storied institution became the first elite college to refuse to comply with the government's demands to limit pro-Palestinian protests and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion policies. That kicked off a series of escalating actions against Harvard. Various federal agencies, including DHS and the National Institutes of Health, have cut their grant funding to Harvard, significantly impacting research projects conducted by faculty. Harvard has sued the administration, seeking to end the grant freeze.",
      "The administration first threatened to revoke Harvard's ability to host international students back in April. Trump also has said Harvard should lose its tax-exempt status. Doing so would strike at the school's ability to fundraise, as wealthy donors often give to tax-exempt institutions to lower their own tax burdens.",

      "The 10,000 bitcoin that software developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid for two Papa John\u2019s pizzas delivered to his Florida home on May 22, 2010, were worth about $41 at the time. Today they\u2019re worth $1.1 billion, as bitcoin hits record high prices.",
      "Several cryptocurrency companies are announcing promotions and other celebrations to mark Bitcoin Pizza Day. Bitget, a cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it\u2019s giving away pizzas to more than 2,000 people at gatherings held around the world.",
      "Here\u2019s the backstory of Bitcoin Pizza Day:",
      "The first bitcoin was created in early 2009 by the digital currency\u2019s still unknown creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. It started as a passion project for libertarian-minded computer nerds who wanted to create a digital payment system that didn\u2019t rely on a third party \u2013 like a government or financial institution \u2013 for transactions.",
      "Hanyecz was an early enthusiast and became active on an early bitcoin internet message board, offering technical advice on how to \u201cmine\u201d bitcoin more effectively.",
      "Central to bitcoin\u2019s technology is the process through which transactions are verified and then recorded on what\u2019s known as the blockchain. Computers connected to the bitcoin network race to solve complex mathematical calculations that verify the transactions, with the winner earning newly minted bitcoins as a reward in a process known as mining.",
      "In the early days, enthusiasts could mine bitcoin through their home computers and Hanyecz accumulated thousands of the new digital asset. Nowadays, mining bitcoin has become a highly competitive field with multi-billion-dollar companies using specialized computers in entire data centers to acquire new bitcoins.",
      "In the early days, no one quite knew what to do with the bitcoin they were mining. On May 18, 2010, Hanyecz tried an experiment and posted a message offering 10,000 bitcoins for pizza.",
      "\u201cI like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that,\u201d Hanyecz wrote.",
      "Three days later, Hanyecz wondered if he needed to up the price.",
      "\u201cSo nobody wants to buy me pizza? Is the bitcoin amount I\u2019m offering too low?\u201d he wrote.",
      "But the next day, Hanyecz said he\u2019d successfully traded his bitcoin for pizza. Another bitcoin enthusiast from California had paid for the Papa John\u2019s pizza in exchange for the cryptocurrency, according to a book about bitcoin's early history, \u201cDigital Gold.\u201d",
      "\u201cA great milestone reached,\u201d said another early bitcoin enthusiast on the message board congratulating Hanyecz.",
      "It did not take long for bitcoin to take off after the first pizza deal. Bitcoin started getting more publicity and grew, thanks in part to the popularity of an online black-market site, Silk Road, which only accepted bitcoin.",
      "By February 2014, with bitcoin trading at around $600, Hanyecz marveled at what the digital currency had become.",
      "\u201cI mean people can say I\u2019m stupid, but it was a great deal at the time,\u201d Hanyecz wrote on the bitcoin message board. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could have known it would take off like this.\u201d",
      "Five years later, when bitcoin was trading as high as $11,000, Hanyecz reflected on what buying that first pizza meant for bitcoin.",
      "\u201cIt made it real for some people, I mean it certainly did for me,\u201d Hanyecz said on the television show \u201c60 minutes.\u201d",
      "Hanyecz has largely stayed out of the public spotlight in recent years and efforts to contact him by The Associated Press were unsuccessful.",
      "After many years of fits and starts, bitcoin now appears firmly entrenched in the mainstream financial system. While it hasn\u2019t taken off as a way to pay for everyday items like pizza, bitcoin has found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value.",
      "Retirement accounts can buy bitcoin ETFs, more and more companies buy bitcoin as corporate treasuries, and President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a government reserve of bitcoin.",
      "Bitcoin was trading at about $111,000 on Thursday morning \u2014 a new record. That price gives it a market cap of more than $2 trillion, or about the same as Amazon.",

      "Butler Snow lawyers repeatedly apologized during the hearing.",
      "They said a firm partner, Matt Reeves, used ChatGPT to research supporting case law but did not verify the information before adding it to two filings with the federal court. Those citations turned out to be \u201challucinations\u201d \u2014 meaning incorrect citations \u2014 by the AI system, they said. Four attorneys signed the filings with the information, including Reeves.",
      "\u201cButler Snow is embarrassed by what happened here, which was against good judgment and firm policy. There is no excuse for using ChatGPT to obtain legal authority and failing to verify the sources it provided, even if to support well founded principles of law,\u201d firm lawyers wrote in a response to the judge.",

      "Alabama has paid millions of dollars to the firm to defend the state prison system and its officials in lawsuits. That includes representing the state as a defendant in a Department of Justice lawsuit alleging that male inmates live in violent and cruel conditions.",
      "The filings in question were made in a lawsuit filed by an inmate who was stabbed on multiple occasions at the William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Jefferson County. It alleges that prison officials are failing to keep inmates safe.",
      "Manasco also questioned Bill Lunsford, head of the Butler Snow division that handles prison litigation, who signed the filings. Alabama's attorney general has appointed Lunsford as a deputy attorney general because he represents the state in court.",
      "Lunsford wrote in a response to the judge that he scanned over the documents before filing them but did not do a detailed review since it had been reviewed by Reeves. He told the judge that the firm has been proactive in warning lawyers about the limitations of artificial intelligence.",

      "New research finds clownfish shrink their bodies to survive warming oceans",
      "NEW YORK -- To survive warming oceans, clownfish cope by shrinking in size.",
      "Scientists observed that some of the orange-striped fish shrank their bodies during a heat wave off the coast of Papa New Guinea. Fish that slimmed were more likely to survive.",
      "Heat waves are becoming more common and intense underwater due to climate change. Warmer water temperatures can bleach sea anemones that clownfish call home, forcing them to adapt to stay alive.",
      "Scientists monitored and measured 134 colorful clownfish in Kimbe Bay during an intense heat wave in 2023 that's still bleaching corals worldwide. They found that 101 clownfish decreased in length on one or more occasions from heat stress.",
      "\u201cWe were really shocked at first when we saw that they were shrinking at all,\u201d said study author Morgan Bennett-Smith with Boston University. The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "Though scientists don\u2019t yet know how clownfish shrink, one idea is that they could be reabsorbing their own bone matter. It\u2019s possible the smaller stature may help the clownfish save energy during a stressful scorch since smaller fish need less food.",
      "Certain clownfish breeding pairs also synced their shrink to boost their survival odds. The females adjusted their size to stay bigger than their partners, keeping the female-dominated social hierarchy intact, researchers said.",
      "Other animals also decrease in size to beat the heat. Marine iguanas get smaller during El Ni\u00f1o events that usher warm waters into the Galapagos. But this coping strategy hadn't yet been spotted in coral reef fish until now.",
      "\u201cThis is another tool in the toolbox that fish are going to use to deal with a changing world,\u201d said Simon Thorrold, an ocean ecologist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who was not involved with the new study.",
      "The tactic helps clownfish weather heat waves in the short-term, but it's not yet clear how the fish will fare if they have to keep it up in the years to come, Thorrold said.",
      "Researchers found the shrinking was temporary. Clownfish possessed the ability to \u201ccatch up\u201d and grow back when their environment got less stressful, showing how living things are staying flexible to keep up with a warming world, said study author Melissa Versteeg with Newcastle University.",
      "\u201cThese natural systems really are under stress, but there's a capacity for incredible resilience,\u201d Versteeg said.",

    "story": [
      "Half of U.S. states now have laws banning or regulating cellphones in schools, with more likely to follow",
      "ATLANTA -- Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023.",
      "Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place, with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly\u2019s Education Committee, on May 13 called phones \u201ca cancer on our kids\u201d that are \u201cdriving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\u201d",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\u201cThis is a not just an academic bill,\u201d Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \u201cThis is a mental health bill. It\u2019s a public safety bill.\u201d",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \u201ca huge win.\"",
      "\u201cTeachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group\u2019s political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\u201d Hoffman said.",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\u201cIt was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\u201cIt is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\u201d Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",
      "\u201cProviding some specific money for this would kind of ease some of those implementation challenges,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201dThat said, most states have not.\"",

      "Google on Tuesday unleashed another wave of artificial intelligence technology to accelerate a year-long makeover of its search engine that is changing the way people get information and curtailing the flow of internet traffic to websites.",
      "The next phase outlined at Google's annual developers conference includes releasing a new \u201cAI mode\u201d option in the United States. The feature makes interacting with Google's search engine more like having a conversation with an expert capable of answering questions on just about any topic imaginable.",
      "AI mode is being offered to all comers in the U.S. just two-and-half-months after the company began testing with a limited Labs division audience.",
      "Google is also feeding its latest AI model Gemini 2.5, into its search algorithms and will soon begin testing other AI features, such as the ability to automatically buy tickets to concerts and conduct searches through live video feeds.",
      "The expansion builds upon a transformation that began a year ago with the introduction of conversational summaries called \u201cAI overviews\u201d that have been increasingly appearing at the top of its results page and eclipsing its traditional rankings of web links.",
      "About 1.5 billion people now regularly engage with \u201cAI overviews,\u201d according to Google, and most users are now entering longer and more complex queries.",
      "\u201cWhat all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said before a packed crowd in an amphitheater near the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters.",
      "Although Pichai and other Google executives predicted AI overviews would trigger more searches and ultimately more clicks to other sites, it hasn't worked out that way so far, according to the findings of search optimization firm BrightEdge.",
      "Clickthrough rates from Google's search results have declined by nearly 30% during the past year, according to BrightEdge's recently released study, which attributed the decrease to people becoming increasingly satisfied with AI overviews.",
      "The decision to make AI mode broadly available after a relatively short test period reflects Google's confidence that the technology won't habitually spew misinformation that tarnishes its brand's reputation, and acknowledges the growing competition from other AI-powered search options from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity.",
      "The rapid rise of AI alternatives emerged as a recurring theme in legal proceedings that could force Google to dismantle parts of its internet empire after a federal judge last year declared its search engine to be an illegal monopoly.",
      "In testimony during a trial earlier this month, longtime Apple executive Eddy Cue said Google searches done through the iPhone maker's Safari browser have been declining because more people are leaning on AI-powered alternatives.",
      "And Google has cited the upheaval being caused by AI's rise as one of the main reasons that it should only be required to make relatively minor changes to the way it operates its search engine because technology already is changing the competitive landscape.",
      "But Google's reliance on more AI so far appears to be enabling its search engine to maintain its mantle as the internet's main gateway \u2014 a position that's main reason its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., boasts a market value of $2 trillion.",
      "During the year ending in March, Google received 136 billion monthly visits, nearly 29 times more than ChatGPT, according to data compiled by onelittleweb.com.",
      "Even Google's own AI mode acknowledged that the company's search engine seems unlikely to be significantly hurt by the shift to AI technology when a reporter from The Associated Press asked whether its introduction would make the company even more powerful.",
      "\u201cYes, it is highly highly that Google's AI mode will make Google more powerful, particularly in the realm of information access and online influence,\u201d the AI mode responded. The feature also warns web publishers should be concerned about AI mode reducing the traffic that they get from search results.",
      "Google's upcoming tests in its Labs division foreshadow the next wave of AI technology likely to be made available to the masses.",
      "Besides using its Project Mariner technology to test the ability of an AI agent to buy tickets and book restaurant reservations, Google will also experiment with searches done through live video and an opt-in option to give its AI technology access to people's Gmail so it can learn more about a user's tastes and interests. Other features on this summer's test list include a \u201cDeep Search\u201d option that will use AI to dig even deeper into complex topics and another tool that will produce graphical presentations of sports and finance data.",
      "Google is also introducing its equivalent of VIP access to all its AI technology with an \u201cUltra\u201d subscription package that will cost $250 per month and include 30 terabytes of storage, too. That's a big step beyond Google's previous top-of-the-line AI \u201cpro\u201d package that cost $20 per month and included two terabytes of storage. \u2014\u2014",

      "HONG KONG -- Shares in CATL, the world\u2019s largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, jumped more than 16% Tuesday in its Hong Kong trading debut after it raised about $4.6 billion in the world\u2019s largest initial public offering this year.",
      "The solid reception for the Chinese company, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., in Hong Kong suggests there is still an appetite among international investors for leading Chinese manufacturers despite trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.",
      "It sold more than 135 million shares at their maximum offer price, 263 Hong Kong dollars ($33.6) each. Its shares rose after they started trading at 296 Hong Kong dollars ($37.80), 12.5% higher than their offer price. They closed 16.4% higher.",
      "CATL also has shares listed in Shenzhen, a business hub neighboring Hong Kong. They initially fell but then edged 1.2% higher.",
      "A supplier to automakers like Tesla, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Ford, Toyota and Honda, CATL held a nearly 38% global market share for EV batteries in 2024, its listing documents showed.",
      "The company has faced pressure from the U.S. In January, the U.S. Defense Department added it to a list of companies it says have ties to China\u2019s military, an accusation that CATL denied. It called the inclusion a \u201cmistake.\u201d",
      "In April, John Moolenaar, chairperson of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, wrote to the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America to demand that the two American banks withdraw from their work on CATL's IPO. But the two banks stayed on.",
      "In the U.S., Ford Motor Co. is licensing technology from CATL to build batteries, but the plan faces resistance from some Republican lawmakers, who have expressed concern that the Chinese company could benefit from U.S. tax dollars.",
      "Because the U.S. has listed CATL as having ties to the U.S. military, the share offering excluded onshore U.S. investors. However, many large U.S. institutional investors have offshore accounts that allowed them to participate.",
      "The company said it plans to use most of the net proceeds from its IPO to build its factory in Hungary, meant to bring it closer to the manufacturing facilities of its main European customers.",
      "Government officials, including Hong Kong\u2019s Financial Secretary Paul Chan, attended its gong-striking ceremony in the city\u2019s vibrant business district, Central, on Tuesday. The company's chairman Robin Zeng said his business is committed to becoming a zero-carbon technology company.",
      "\u201cListing in Hong Kong means we are more broadly integrated into the global capital markets, and it\u2019s also a new starting point for us to promote the global zero-carbon economy,\u201d Zeng said.",
      "Zeng, who trained as a physicist, helped found Amperex Technology Ltd. in 1999. It mainly was engaged in research and development and manufacturing of consumer lithium batteries. The company was sold to Tokyo-listed TDK Corporation in 2005, but Zeng continued to oversee the firm's management until 2017, its listing documents say.",
      "In 2011, a team led by Zeng founded CATL, headquartered in the businessman's hometown of Ningde in Fujian province in southeast China. The literal meaning of the company's Chinese name is \u201cNingde Era.\"",
      "CATL says it has the broadest coverage of EV battery users globally, with its batteries installed in over 17 million EVs, or one in every three EVs worldwide, as of the end of 2024.",
      "Terence Chong, executive director of the Lau Chor Tak Institute of Global Economics and Finance at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said Hong Kong hasn\u2019t seen an IPO of this size in a while and the listing may boost such activity in the city.",
      "The exclusion of U.S. investors had little impact since there was sufficient demand for CATL's offering, he said.",

      "The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate has voted to move forward with legislation to regulate a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins, two weeks after Democrats blocked the measure.",
      "Monday\u2019s 66-32 procedural vote keeps one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top legislative priorities on track for passage and highlights the growing political strength of the cryptocurrency industry, which spent heavily in last year\u2019s election and has amassed a large war chest for next year\u2019s midterms. Several Democrats reversed and voted to move forward with the legislation after negotiations with Republicans in recent days.",
      "The fate of the legislation, which would regulate how stablecoin issuers operate in the U.S., had been uncertain in recent weeks despite early bipartisan support. Senate Democrats blocked it earlier this month in part over concerns about how Trump and his family were benefiting from private crypto endeavors, including a newly launched stablecoin.",
      "Republicans won support from Democrats after strengthening regulations on foreign issuers, beefing up enforcement and barring large tech companies like Meta and Google from issuing their own stablecoins. The Senate will now consider the bill and could vote on final passage as soon as this week, depending on the number of amendments offered by Democrats and Republicans.",
      "Still, Democrats were divided on the legislation. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others have said the bill could help Trump enrich himself and needs stronger protections.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the final bill does nothing \u2014 nothing \u2014 to rein in the President\u2019s crypto corruption,\u201d Warren said ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. She said the legislation would \u201caccelerate Trump\u2019s corruption by supercharging the size of the stablecoin market\u201d and make Trump \u201cthe regulator of his own financial product.\u201d",
      "Negotiators added tougher ethics rules for members of Congress and the executive branch, including preventing members of Congress from issuing stablecoins. But Warren and several other Democrats said it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cThis Congress should be a check on the president,\u201d Warren said.",
      "The bill would aim to create a federal framework to regulate the stablecoin industry, which is currently governed by a patchwork of existing federal and state laws.",
      "Stablecoins are a fast-growing corner of the cryptocurrency industry that have produced enormous profits for some of the major players involved. They offer a buffer from cryptocurrency\u2019s notorious volatility because they are pegged to real-world assets, like U.S. dollars or gold. Typically, that means a single stablecoin is worth $1, making them a much more reliable digital asset for commercial transactions than other forms of crypto.",
      "The move to regulate the industry has been bipartisan, but Trump\u2019s involvement in the crypto industry complicated the legislation\u2019s path. Trump launched a meme coin earlier this year that has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. And he is set to attend a dinner May 22 that\u2019s open to almost anyone who buys enough of the coins.",
      "Another Trump-family linked crypto venture called World Liberty Financial recently announced that it was issuing its own stablecoin, called USD1. The stablecoin got a huge boost when World Liberty Financial announced last week that an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates would be using $2 billion worth of USD1 to purchase a stake in Binance, the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "A former skeptic turned zealous promoter, Trump has promised to usher in a golden age for the cryptocurrency industry. His administration has already taken many early actions without Congress to boost crypto, including establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve and undoing previous enforcement actions. But Trump needs Congress to get some of his and the deep-pocketed industry\u2019s top priorities passed, including enacting the stablecoin legislation.",
      "Democratic supporters of the legislation argued that Congress can\u2019t step aside just because of Trump\u2019s involvement in the market.",
      "\u201cThe stablecoin market has reached nearly $250 billion and the U.S. can\u2019t afford to keep standing on the sidelines,\u201d said Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, one of the lead Democratic negotiators on the legislation. \u201cWe need clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has signed the Take It Down Act into law",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Monday signed into law the Take It Down Act, a measure that imposes penalties for online sexual exploitation that first lady Melania Trump helped usher through Congress, and he had her sign it, too, despite what sounded like a mild objection on her part.",
      "\u201cC'mon, sign it anyway,\u201d the president told his wife. \u201cShe deserves to sign it,\u201d he said.",
      "After she added her signature, the president showed the document bearing both of their names to the audience at the signing ceremony in the White House Rose Garden. Melania Trump's signature is merely symbolic because first ladies are not elected and have no formal role in the signing of legislation.",
      "In March, Melania Trump used her first public appearance since resuming the role of first lady to travel to Capitol Hill to lobby House members to pass the bill following its approval by the Senate.",
      "At a signing ceremony, she called the new law a \u201cnational victory\u201d that will help protect children from online exploitation, including through the use of artificial intelligence to make fake images.",
      "\u201cAI and social media are the digital candy for the next generation, sweet addictive and engineered to have an impact on the cognitive development of our children,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unlike sugar, these new technologies can be weaponized, shape beliefs and, sadly, affect emotions and even be deadly.\u201d",
      "The president said the proliferation of images made using AI means that \u201ccountless women have been harassed with deepfakes and other explicit images distributed against their will.\u201d He said what's happening is \u201cjust so horribly wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, we're making it totally illegal,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The bill makes it a federal crime to \u201cknowingly publish\u201d or threaten to publish intimate images without a person\u2019s consent, including AI-created \u201cdeepfakes.\u201d Websites and social media companies will be required to remove such material within 48 hours after a victim requests it. The platforms must also take steps to delete duplicate content.",
      "Many states have already banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn, but the Take It Down Act is a rare example of federal regulators imposing on internet companies.",
      "The bill, sponsored by Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, passing the House in April by a 409-2 vote and clearing the Senate by unanimous consent.",
      "But the measure isn't without critics. Free speech advocates and digital rights groups say the bill is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate images, including legal pornography and LGBTQ content. Others say it could allow the government to monitor private communications and undermine due process.",
      "The first lady appeared at a Capitol Hill roundtable with lawmakers and young women who had explicit images of them put online, saying it was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d to see what teenagers and especially girls go through after this happens to them. She also included a victim among her guests for the president's address to a joint session of Congress the day after that meeting.",
      "After the House passed the bill, Melania Trump said the bipartisan vote was a \u201cpowerful statement that we stand united in protecting the dignity, privacy and safety of our children.\u201d",
      "Her advocacy for the bill is a continuation of the Be Best campaign she started in the president's first term, focusing on children's well-being, social media use and opioid abuse.",
      "In his speech to Congress in March, the president said he looked forward to signing the bill.",
      "\u201cAnd I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d he said, adding, that there's nobody who \"gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody.\u201d",

      "Scientists have found evidence of monkey kidnappings in Panama",
      "WASHINGTON -- A baby howler monkey clung to the back of an older male monkey, its tiny fingers grasping fur. But they're not related and not even the same species.",
      "Scientists spotted surprising evidence of what they describe as monkey kidnappings while reviewing video footage from a small island of Panama. The capuchin monkeys were seen carrying at least 11 howler babies between 2022 and 2023.",
      "\u201cThis was very much a shocking finding,\u201d said Zo\u00eb Goldsborough, a behavioral ecologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Germany. \u201cWe\u2019ve not seen anything like this in the animal kingdom.\"",
      "The monkeys' motivations remain under investigation. Capuchins are house cat-size monkeys found in South America and Central America. They are long-lived, clever and learn new behaviors from each other. One group of capuchins in Panama has even learned to use stone tools to crack open nuts and seafood.",
      "Goldsberg and other researchers at Max Planck and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute had set up more than 80 cameras to study capuchin tool use, but were surprised to see the first howler babies appear in early 2022.",
      "The footage showed the capuchins walking and pounding their stone tools with baby howlers on their backs. But cameras did not capture the moments of abduction, which scientists said likely happened up in the trees, where howlers spend most of their time.",
      "\u201cOur window into this story is constrained,\u201d said co-author Margaret Crofoot of Max Planck and the Smithsonian. The findings were published Monday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "In most or all cases, the baby howlers died, researchers said. Infant howler monkeys would normally be carried by their mothers while still nursing. All the babies in the video -- from a few weeks to a few months in age -- were too young to be weaned.",
      "\u201cA hopeful part of me wants to believe some escaped and went back to their mothers, but we don\u2019t know,\" said Crofoot.",
      "The videos recorded a few instances of young capuchin males still carrying howler babies that had died, likely from starvation. Many animals -- from gorillas to orcas -- have been observed carrying their own dead offspring, though scientists aren\u2019t sure the reasons.",
      "Why did the capuchin males do it? There were no signs of deliberate aggression toward the babies and they weren\u2019t eaten, ruling out predation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all spent hours wracking our brains why they would do this,\u201d said Goldsborough.",
      "The first baby-snatcher may have had a confused \u201ccaring motivation,\u201d or parental instinct, because he showed gentleness interacting with the infants, she said. Then four other males copied his actions.",
      "The researchers said they don't believe the capuchins harmed the babies on purpose. So far, only one group of capuchins has been known to kidnap.",
      "The research shows the \u201cremarkable behavioral variation across social groups of the same species,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France, who was not involved in the study.",

      "Health agencies working under Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. clinched the political support needed to become the nation\u2019s top health official by pledging to work within the decades-old federal system for approval and use of vaccines. Yet his regulators are promising big changes that cloud the outlook for what shots might even be available.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration will soon \u201cunleash a massive framework\u201d for how vaccines are tested and approved, according to Commissioner Marty Makary. Details aren't yet public but the plan is being overseen by the agency's new vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, an outspoken critic of the FDA's handling of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "Makary and other Trump administration officials already have taken unprecedented steps that raise uncertainty about next fall's COVID-19 vaccinations, including delaying FDA scientists' full approval of Novavax's shot \u2014 and then restricting its use to people at higher risk from the virus. They've also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products requiring extra testing.",
      "The changes cross multiple health agencies.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn't yet acted on an influential advisory panel's recent recommendations on use of a new meningitis shot or broader RSV vaccination. A meeting of Kennedy's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d allies was recently told to expect an end to COVID-19 booster recommendations for children \u2014 something that vaccine advisory panel was supposed to debate in June. And researchers around the country lost National Institutes of Health funding to study vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\u201cI think you have to assume that RFK Jr.\u2019s intention is to make it harder for vaccines to come to market,\u201d said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a vaccine expert at Johns Hopkins University. The changes are \u201clooked at suspiciously because this is someone with a proven track record of evading the value of vaccines.\u201d",
      "In a Senate health committee hearing last week, Kennedy wrongly claimed that the only vaccines tested against a placebo, or dummy shot, were for COVID-19.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the committee, briefly interrupted the hearing to say, \u201cFor the record, that\u2019s not true\" \u2014 pointing to placebo-controlled studies of the rotavirus, measles and HPV vaccines.",
      "Concerned by rhetoric about how vaccines are tested, a group of doctors recently compiled a list of more than 120 vaccine clinical trials spanning decades, most of them placebo-controlled, including for shots against polio, hepatitis B, mumps and tetanus.",
      "\u201cIt directly debunks the claim that vaccines were never tested against placebo,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, a Stanford University infectious disease physician who\u2019s helping lead the project.",
      "Antivaccine groups argue that some substances scientists call a placebo may not really qualify, although the list shows simple saline shots are common.",
      "Sometimes a vaccine causes enough shot-site pain or swelling that it\u2019s evident who\u2019s getting the vaccine and who\u2019s in the control group \u2014 and studies might use another option that slightly irritates the skin to keep the test \u201cblinded,\u201d Scott explained.",
      "And when there\u2019s already a proven vaccine for the same disease, it\u2019s unethical to test a new version against a placebo, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t always expect placebo-controlled trials,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that be communicated clearly to the public, but it\u2019s challenging especially when there\u2019s so much noise in social media and so much misinformation.\u201d",
      "The administration's promise of a new vaccine framework comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where FDA advisers will discuss updating COVID-19 shots for this fall and winter.",
      "The FDA\u2019s credibility has long rested on the independence of its scientific decisions. While the agency is led by a handful of political appointees, approval decisions are almost always handled by career scientists.",
      "But that standard appears to be shifting. FDA staffers were poised to approve Novavax\u2019s vaccine early last month but the decision was delayed by administration officials, including Makary, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss agency matters. The shot was approved late Friday with unusual restrictions.",
      "Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg \u2014 a political appointee serving as Makary's special assistant \u2014 was involved in the unprecedented demand that Novavax conduct a new clinical trial of its shot after approval, according to the people. The requirement came shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign.",
      "Hoeg \u2014 along with Makary and Prasad \u2014 spent much of the COVID-19 pandemic criticizing the FDA\u2019s handling of booster shots, particularly in children and young adults. All three were co-authors of a 2022 paper stating that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more harm than benefit.",
      "Novavax isn\u2019t the only vaccine manufacturer already affected by changing attitudes at FDA. Earlier this month, Moderna pushed back the target date for its new COVID-and-flu combination vaccine to next year after the FDA requested additional effectiveness data.",
      "As the FDA\u2019s top official overseeing vaccines, Prasad is now in position to reverse what he recently called \u201ca number of missteps\u201d in how the FDA assessed the benefits and risks of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "He questioned how much benefit yearly vaccinations continue to offer. In a podcast shortly before assuming his FDA job, Prasad suggested companies could study about 20,000 older adults in August or September to show if an updated vaccine prevented COVID-related hospitalizations.",
      "There is \u201clegitimate debate about who should be boosted, how frequently they should be boosted and the value of boosting low-risk individuals,\u201d said Hopkins' Adalja. But he stressed that CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has the proper expertise to be making those decisions.",
      "And other experts say simply updating the strain that a COVID-19 vaccine targets doesn't make it a new product \u2014 and real-world data shows each fall's update has offered benefit.",
      "\"The data are clear and compelling\u201d that vaccination reduces seniors' risk of hospitalization and serious illness for four to six months, said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher.",
      "Nor could that kind of study be accomplished quickly enough to get millions of people vaccinated before the yearly winter surge, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief.",
      "\"You'd always be doing clinical trials and you'd never have a vaccine that was up to date,\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted",
      "ATLANTA -- President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order seeking to overhaul how U.S. elections are run includes a somewhat obscure reference to the way votes are counted. Voting equipment, it says, should not use ballots that include \u201ca barcode or quick-response code.\u201d",
      "Those few technical words could have a big impact.",
      "Voting machines that give all voters a ballot with one of those codes are used in hundreds of counties across 19 states. Three of them -- Georgia, South Carolina and Delaware -- use the machines statewide.",
      "Some computer scientists, Democrats and left-leaning election activists have raised concerns about their use, but those pushing conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election have been the loudest, claiming without evidence that manipulation has already occurred. Trump, in justifying the move, said in the order that his intention was \u201cto protect election integrity.\u201d",
      "Even some election officials who have vouched for the accuracy of systems that use coded ballots have said it\u2019s time to move on because too many voters don\u2019t trust them.",
      "Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Democrat Jena Griswold, decided in 2019 to stop using ballots with QR codes, saying at the time that voters \u201cshould have the utmost confidence that their vote will count.\u201d Amanda Gonzalez, the elections clerk in Colorado\u2019s Jefferson County, doesn't support Trump's order but believes Colorado's decision was a worthwhile step.",
      "\u201cWe can just eliminate confusion,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cAt the end of the day, that\u2019s what I want -- elections that are free, fair, transparent.\u201d",
      "Whether voting by mail or in person, millions of voters across the country mark their selections by using a pen to fill in ovals on paper ballots. Those ballots are then fed through a tabulating machine to tally the votes and can be retrieved later if a recount is needed.",
      "In other places, people voting in person use a touch-screen machine to mark their choices and then get a paper record of their votes that includes a barcode or QR code. A tabulator scans the code to tally the vote.",
      "Election officials who use that equipment say it\u2019s secure and that they routinely perform tests to ensure the results match the votes on the paper records, which they retain. The coded ballots have nevertheless become a target of election conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cI think the problem is super exaggerated,\u201d said Lawrence Norden of the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cI understand why it can appeal to certain parts of the public who don\u2019t understand the way this works, but I think it\u2019s being used to try to question certain election results in the past.\u201d",
      "Those pushing conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election have latched onto a long-running legal battle over Georgia's voting system. In that case, a University of Michigan computer scientist testified that an attacker could tamper with the QR codes to change voter selections and install malware on the machines.",
      "The testimony from J. Alex Halderman has been used to amplify Trump\u2019s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, even though there is no evidence that any of the weaknesses he found were exploited.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, has defended the state's voting system as secure. In March, the judge who presided over Halderman's testimony declined to block the use of Georgia\u2019s voting equipment but said the case had \u201cidentified substantial concerns about the administration, maintenance and security of Georgia\u2019s electronic in-person voting system.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election executive order is being challenged in multiple lawsuits. One has resulted in a preliminary injunction against a provision that sought to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.",
      "The section banning ballots that use QR or barcodes relies on a Trump directive to a federal agency, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, which sets voluntary guidelines for voting systems. Not all states follow them.",
      "Some of the lawsuits say Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to direct the commission because it was established by Congress as an independent agency.",
      "While the courts sort that out, the commission\u2019s guidelines say ballots using barcodes or QR codes should include a printed list of the voters\u2019 selections so they can be checked.",
      "Trump\u2019s order exempts voting equipment used by voters with disabilities, but it promises no federal money to help states and counties shift away from systems using QR or barcodes.",
      "\u201cIn the long run, it would be nice if vendors moved away from encoding, but there\u2019s already evidence of them doing that,\u201d said Pamela Smith, president of the group Verified Voting.",
      "Kim Dennison, election coordinator of Benton County, Arkansas, estimated that updating the county's voting system would cost around $400,000 and take up to a year.",
      "Dennison said she has used equipment that relies on coded ballots since she started her job 15 years ago and has never found an inaccurate result during postelection testing.",
      "\u201cI fully and completely trust the equipment is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to be doing and not falsifying reports,\u201d she said. \u201cYou cannot change a vote once it\u2019s been cast.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s Luzerne County, voting machines that produce a QR code will be used in this year\u2019s primary. But officials expect a manufacturer\u2019s update later this year to remove the code before the November elections.",
      "County Manager Romilda Crocamo said officials had not received any complaints from voters about QR codes but decided to make the change when Dominion Voting Systems offered the update.",
      "The nation\u2019s most populous county, Los Angeles, uses a system with a QR code that it developed over a decade and deployed in 2020 after passing a state testing and certification program.",
      "The county\u2019s chief election official, Dean Logan, said the system exceeded federal guidelines at the time and meets many of the standards outlined in the most recent ones approved in 2021. He said postelection audits have consistently confirmed its accuracy.",
      "Modifying or replacing it would be costly and take years, he said. The county\u2019s current voting equipment is valued at $140 million.",
      "Perhaps nowhere has the issue been more contentious than Georgia, a presidential battleground. It uses the same QR code voting system across the state.",
      "Marilyn Marks, executive director of the Coalition for Good Governance, a lead plaintiff in the litigation over the system, said her group has not taken a position on Trump's executive order but said the federal Election Assistance Commission should stop certifying machines that use barcodes.",
      "The secretary of state said the voting system follows Georgia law, which requires federal certification at the time the system is bought. Nevertheless, the Republican-controlled legislature has voted to ban the use of QR codes but did not allocate any money to make the change \u2014 a cost estimated at $66 million.",
      "Republicans said they want to replace the system when the current contract expires in 2028, but their law is still scheduled to take effect next year. GOP state Rep. Victor Anderson said there is no realistic way to \u201cprevent the train wreck that\u2019s coming.\u201d",

      "NEW DELHI -- The Indian space agency\u2019s mission to launch into orbit a new Earth observation satellite failed after the launch vehicle encountered a technical issue during the third stage of flight, officials said Sunday.",
      "The EOS-09 Earth observation satellite took off on board the PSLV-C61 launch vehicle from the Sriharikota space center in southern India on Sunday morning.",

      "Fortnite says it\u2019s unavailable on Apple\u2019s iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe",
      "NEW YORK -- Fortnite says it's now unavailable on Apple's iOS globally because the tech giant blocked a bid to rerelease the popular video game for iPhone users in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 marking the latest twist in a yearslong feud.",
      "Apple pulled Epic Games-owned Fortnite from its app store back in 2020, just two years after the widely-popular, multiplayer survival game had launched on iOS and garnered millions of users. iPhone players in the U.S. have been locked out since, although Apple users in the EU had been able to download the game through an alternative store over the last nine months.",
      "Following years of a tense litigation, a recent court ruling was set to clear the way for Fortnite to finally return to iOS users in the U.S., too. But the video game said early Friday that a move from Apple has prevented that \u2014 and, as a result, Fortnite says it's now dark on iOS globally.",
      "\u201cApple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the U.S. App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union,\" Fortnite wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cSadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.\"",
      "In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Apple said it had asked Epic Sweden to resubmit the app update \u201cwithout including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.\u201d Sweden is where Epic\u2019s developer account for its alternative app store is based.",
      "But, Apple added, it \"did not take any action to remove the live version of Fortnite from alternative distribution marketplaces.\u201d",
      "Epic did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "In the U.S., Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple back in 2020, alleging the technology trendsetter was illegally using its power to gouge game makers. After a monthlong trial in 2021, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against most of Epic\u2019s claims, but ordered Apple to loosen its previously-exclusive control over the payments made for in-app commerce and allow links to alternative options in the U.S. for the first time \u2014 threatening to undercut sizable commissions that Apple had been collecting from in-app transactions for over a decade.",
      "After exhausting an appeal that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Apple last year introduced a new system that opened the door for links to alternative payment options while still imposing a 27% commission on in-app transactions executed outside its own system.",
      "Epic fired back by alleging Apple was thumbing its nose at the legal system, reviving another round of court hearings that lasted nearly a year before Gonzalez Rogers delivered a stinging rebuke last month \u2014 which held Apple in civil contempt and banned the company from collecting any commission on alternative payment systems.",
      "That ruling cleared the way for Epic to finally return to the iPhone app store in the U.S., a reinstatement the video game maker was anticipating before Apple\u2019s latest move.",
      "Fortnite's availability in the EU, meanwhile, is under an alternative store for iPhone users \u2014 now called the Epic Games Store. Apple cleared the way for this last year under new regulatory pressures. Prior to Friday, Fortnite and other Epic games had been available for download on iPhones using this store in the EU since August 2024.",
      "Before the companies' prolonged legal battle, Epic launched Fortnite on iOS in April 2018. Between then and its August 2020 removal, 116 million users accessed Fortnite on iOS devices, company filings note \u2014 raking in a daily average of about 2.5 million players, which represented about 10% of Fortnite's total daily traffic at the time.",

      "A couple was killed after leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum.",
      "After two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot outside the Capital Jewish Museum, questions were being raised Thursday about whether there was sufficient security at the event Wednesday nght.",
      "It is unclear whether the museum provided the type of security that experts ABC News spoke with said is routine, especially with diplomats and officials in attendance.",
      "Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela A. Smith confirmed during a news conference Thursday afternoon there were private security officers working the event but said neither on- or off-duty MPD officers were there.",
      "\"We are working to reopen the museum in the coming days, with all necessary security in place, so we can return to telling the story of Jewish Washington for thousands of visitors from around the world,\" Capital Jewish Museum Executive Director Beatrice Gurwitz said.",
      "Former acting Homeland Security Undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis John Cohen, an ABC News contributor, said that even though the shooting of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim occurred close to the Washington FBI Field Office, \"that shouldn't be confused as an increased security.\"",
      "\"What this situation does illustrate is that we are in a period of heightened threat -- part of that threat is directed at the Jewish community -- and that facilities associated with the Jewish community, faith-based communities need to have put in place security measures to protect those people who are visiting those locations, whether it's for services or for educational activities or special events, such as the one that occurred last night,\" he said.",
      "Speaking to reporters outside the Capital Jewish Museum Thursday morning, Attorney General Pam Bondi acknowledged she did not know of the event's security posture before the shooting occurred.",
      "But when asked by ABC News if there had been a \"a security failure\" given the proximity of the FBI's Washington Field Office, Bondi denied any lapse in security.",
      "\"I don't think anyone would have expected what happened last night,\" Bondi said. \"They were in an event, a beautiful event. People were -- it was a dressy event. They were dressed up, they were all together and just celebrating.",
      "\"But no, I think law enforcement were on the scene immediately because of that, and the great men and women of the FBI are doing an incredible job, as well as Metropolitan police,\" she added. \"Our [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] agents were out here. Our U.S. Marshals were out here working hand in hand with the mayor and the police chief, who I cannot say enough good about right now.\"",
      "Former Deputy Special Agent in Charge Derek Meyer, of the Secret Service's Chicago Field Office, noted that \"private entities with internal security operations often supplement their existing posture with extra security during special events or when they encounter a specific threat or concerns.\"",
      "\"Those without existing security will typically hire security or off-duty law enforcement for major events, holidays, during times of civil unrest and when they learn of a direct threat,\" he added.",
      "\"Typically, off-duty law enforcement officers operate under the licensing of a private security company, subject to specific regional statutes and regulations,\" Meyer said. \"In this capacity, these officers are empowered to detain individuals whom they directly observe committing crimes or if they have reasonable grounds to believe a crime has occurred. After detention, the custody of individuals is promptly transferred to on-duty law enforcement upon their arrival.\"",
      "Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said the event did not fall into the city's \"special events\" category in which local and federal law enforcement would have a \"stood-up posture.\"",
      "\"This was a relatively small event at a museum, so MPD or the government agencies wouldn't stand up additional resources unless they were requested or unless we got a call for service,\" Bowser said. However, she noted that the local and federal government do have grant programs that \"have helped institutions, faith institutions and others who have been concerned about violence, antisemitism or other hateful speech and rhetoric.\"",
      "\"And very recently we have issued grants and we have issued grants over the last several years to those institutions to harden their security and cameras and additional security, and I believe that the museum has done some of those things,\" she added.",

    "summary": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial recap day 13: 2nd week of testimony concludes with Kid Cudi describing alleged car bombing",
    "story": [
      "The jury was released for an extended Memorial Day weekend break on Thursday.",
      "The musician and actor Kid Cudi took the stand on Thursday in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs sex trafficking and racketeering trial to testify that the rap mogul, in a fit of rage and jealousy, broke into his home and he believed coordinated the firebombing of his high-end sports car.",
      "The testimony in the star-studded trial could play a critical role as prosecutors attempt to build a case that Combs used violence and threats to run a criminal enterprise that he used to hurt his rivals and protect the entertainment and cultural kingdom he had built.",
      "Kid Cudi, whose legal name is Scott Mescudi, told jurors that he briefly dated star witness and Combs' ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura in 2011. The romance was called off, according to his testimony, because of Combs' threats, but Mescudi said he suspected that Combs nevertheless coordinated the firebombing of his car to send a message to the rival musician.",
      "\"I knew Sean Combs was violent,\" said Mescudi, adding that Ventura confided in him that Combs \"would hit her, sometimes kick her.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers have denied that he had any involvement in the alleged firebombing, and Mescudi testified that Combs said he was unaware of the incident when they met in 2012 to hash out their differences. Mescudi elicited a few laughs from the courtroom as he described how he met Combs in an exclusive club in Los Angeles, finding the rap mogul \"staring out the window with his hands behind his back like a Marvel supervillain.\"",
      "Prosecutors have alleged that Combs committed multiple crimes, including arson, to orchestrate a sprawling criminal conspiracy. Combs has denied the charges against him and pleaded not guilty. The trial ended its third week Thursday, as the judge released the jury for an extended Memorial Day weekend break.",
      "Kid Cudi says he believes Combs torched his car, broke into his home",
      "Mescudi's relationship with Ventura was brief, but it was marked by violent threats from Combs that prompted him and Ventura to stop seeing one another, according to Mescudi.",
      "After starting a romance with the singer and model who was involved with Combs on-and-off for years, Mescudi said he received an abrupt phone call from Ventura to warn that Combs had learned they were seeing each other.",
      "\"I was confused but she asked me to pick her up. She sounded really stressed on the phone, scared, nervous. So I went to go pick her up,\" Mescudi testified, saying that he soon received a call from Combs' assistant informing him that Combs had broken into his home.",
      "\"I said, 'M\u2014----, you in my house?' And he said, 'What's up?' 'Are you in my house? I just want to talk to you. I'm on my way over right now,'\" he testified.",
      "Mescudi said he quickly drove to his home but did not find Combs, though there were traces of his visit. He said the Christmas gifts he bought for his family had been opened and his dog was locked in the bathroom.",
      "Mescudi said he and Ventura eventually broke up because \"things were getting out of hand\" and he felt concerned for their safety.",
      "During her testimony last week, Ventura said that Combs threatened to hurt her and Mescudi if their relationship continued and vowed to blow up the car of the rival rapper. Mescudi testified that he suspected Combs followed through with the threat in early 2012, telling jurors that someone had cut the soft top of his Porsche open and placed a lit molotov cocktail inside. Jurors were shown the results of that episode when prosecutors entered into evidence multiple photos of the charred vehicle.",
      "Mescudi said he met to talk with Combs about the incident a few days later at SoHo House Los Angeles. His goal was to reconcile, but Combs claimed he did not know about the firebombing.",
      "\"We stood up, shook hands and as I was shaking his hand I said 'What are we going to do about my car?'\" Mescudi said. \"He looked right back at me, very cold stare, and said 'I don't know what you're talking about.''",
      "Years later, Mescudi said he ran into Combs once again at Soho House, where Combs said he wanted to \"apologize for everything.\"",
      "Combs' assistant says he quit after witnessing abuse",
      "The trial started Thursday with a return to the witness stand of Combs' personal assistant, George Kaplan. Testifying under an immunity deal so he cannot be prosecuted for anything he admits to, Kaplan said he left after 15 months because he could no longer continue \"fixing\" problems for Combs after the mogul's repeated acts of violence.",
      "Kaplan testified that he saw Combs become violent on three occasions, including one episode when he was summoned to Combs' bedroom only to find Ventura crying and bruised in bed. He also recounted seeing Combs holding a whisky glass over Ventura's head during a flight to Las Vegas and another instance in 2015 when a \"very angry\" Combs threw apples at another one of his girlfriends.",
      "\"I was not comfortable being aligned with the physical behavior I had seen pieces of during the course of the months,\" Kaplan said, explaining his decision to leave Combs' staff.",
      "Because working for Combs was his first professional job, Kaplan said he didn't feel like he could intervene, worried that he might blow what he thought could be his door into the entertainment industry.",
      "\"In my heart of hearts I knew what was happening and I felt an element of guilt that I didn't do anything to stop it,\" he told jurors.",
      "Fourth witness says she witnesses Combs abuse Ventura",
      "Prosecutors called makeup artist Mylah Morales to testify about a 2010 incident when Combs allegedly assaulted Ventura in their hotel suite. According to Morales, Combs stormed into the room they rented at the Beverly Hills Hotel after a night out.",
      "\"Where the f\u2014- is she?\" Combs allegedly shouted before he walked into the bedroom where Ventura was and closed the door, according to Morales' testimony.",
      "Morales said she heard \"yelling and screaming\" before Combs exited the hotel room. She said Ventura had a swollen eye, busted lip, and \"knots on her head\" after the incident.",
      "According to Morales, Ventura stayed with her for a few days to recover after the incident. Morales testified that a friend who was a doctor checked on Ventura to see if she had a concussion and suggested she visit an emergency room, according to her testimony, but Ventura allegedly said it was \"her wish not to go to the ER.\"",
      "On cross-examination, Combs' lawyers highlighted that Morales did not directly witness the alleged assault because she was outside the bedroom.",
      "The testimony from Morales marks the fourth witness to tell the jury that they saw Combs commit acts of violence towards women. Earlier witnesses Dawn Richard and Kerry Morgan alleged they witnessed Combs abuse Ventura, and Kaplan testified that he said he saw Combs be violent to Ventura and another woman.",
      "Prosecutors move down their witness list",
      "Federal prosecutors called two additional witnesses on Thursday afternoon, including a federal agent who conducted an analysis of electronic devices belonging to Ventura and the manager of a luxury hotel in Beverly Hills.",
      "The general manager of the L'Ermitage Beverly Hills, Frederick Zemmour, said Combs frequently stayed at the hotel, and his guest profile noted some characteristics that other witnesses said were features of the drug-fueled sex parties called \"freak offs\" that Combs would host.",
      "\"Always spills candle wax on everything and uses excessive amounts of oil, place rooms out of order upon departure for deep cleaning,\" Zemmour said, citing notes the hotel kept on Combs.",
      "When Ventura testified last week, she said Combs often booked rooms at L'Ermitage Beverly Hills to host \"freak offs.\" She recounted one instance when Combs allegedly requested she get into a blowup pool that was filled with \"lube and oil.\"",
      "\"Did you want to get into a pool of baby oil?\" prosecutor Emily Johnson asked.",
      "\"No, especially not in a hotel room like that. It was such a mess,\" Ventura said on the stand.",

      "The judge's ruling blocks the government from firing half the DOE's workforce.",
      "A federal judge in Boston has blocked the Trump administration from attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "U.S. District Judge Myong Joun issued a preliminary injunction Thursday that bars the Trump administration from firing half the Department of Education's workforce.",
      "The order from Judge Joun -- a Biden appointee -- also prohibits the Department of Education from transferring the management of federal student loans to the Small Business Administration.",
      "The decision marks the first time a federal judge has determined the Trump administration's sweeping changes to the Department of Education are unlawful.",
      "For now, the order puts a stop to the Trump administration's effort to fire more than 2,000 Department of Education employees, transfer federal student loan obligations, and otherwise implement the president's March 20 executive order to \"take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.\"",
      "Madi Biedermann, Department of Education deputy assistant secretary for communications, said the agency\u2019s reduction-in-force was lawful and called Joun a far-left judge who \u201coverstepped\u201d his authority.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind,\u201d Biedermann wrote in a statement to ABC News. \u201cThis ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families. We will immediately challenge this on an emergency basis.\u201d",
      "A group that includes several state attorneys general, schools, and nonprofits challenged Trump's efforts to reduce the size of the Department of Education last month, arguing the president cannot unilaterally shut down a federal department created by Congress.",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the efforts to reduce the Department of Education would make it more efficient, and were separate from Trump's vow to abolish the department.",
      "Judge Joun was unconvinced. His decision offered a blistering assessment of the Trump administration's claim that recent changes to the Department of Education are to improve efficiency, rather than carry out Trump's vow to abolish the Department outright.",
      "\"The idea that Defendants' actions are merely a 'reorganization' is plainly not true,\" he wrote.",
      "The changes imposed by Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Judge Joun wrote, \"effectively impossible for the Department to carry out its statutorily mandated functions.\"",
      "Though Trump has the authority to remove executive officers, the president does not have the power to dismantle entire federal departments outright, he wrote. He also cast doubt on the claim that the legislative effort to abolish the Department of Education was separate from his executive actions.",
      "\"Not only is there no evidence that Defendants are pursuing a 'legislative goal' or otherwise working with Congress to reach a resolution, but there is also no evidence that the RIF has actually made the Department more efficient. Rather, the record is replete with evidence of the opposite,\" the judge wrote, referring to the \"reduction in force\" firings.",
      "\"Consolidated Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the Department will not be able to carry out its statutory functions -- and in some cases, is already unable to do so -- and Defendants have proffered no evidence to the contrary,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Today's order means that the Trump administration's disastrous mass firings of career civil servants are blocked while this wildly disruptive and unlawful agency action is litigated,\" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which represented several of the plaintiffs. \"Instead of taking a wrecking ball to our nation's best values and our chance at a better future, this administration should be focused on how to improve education and opportunities for all.\"",
      "\"Today, the court rightly rejected one of the administration's very first illegal, and consequential, acts: abolishing the federal role in education,\" American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said of the ruling. \"The vast majority of Americans and states like Massachusetts, with the highest NAEP scores, want to keep the education department because it ensures all kids, not just some, can get a shot at a better life.\"",
      "The injunction comes as Education Secretary Linda McMahon resumed calls to downsize the department during the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2026 budget hearing on Capitol Hill. McMahon defended President Trump\u2019s $12 billion dollar cut to the department in his skinny budget proposal and McMahon stressed her \u201cfinal mission\u201d to uncreate the agency must be done in a \u201clawful fashion.\u201d",
      "The injunction is good news for some former Department of Education employees who spoke to ABC News.",
      "Kishia Kegler, one of hundreds of fired civil servants whose official separation starts in June, told ABC News she is committed to returning as appeals play out.",
      "\u201cStudents and families need the services that the Department of Education provides,\u201d Kegler said in a statement. \u201cIt's been broken since this unlawful takeover and dismantling began. I'm still committed to this work.\u201d",

    "summary": "Newly sworn-in Social Security chief Frank Bisignano, who previously was a Wall Street executive, told staffers he had to Google the SSA job when it was offered to him.",
    "story": [
      "ABC News obtained audio of Frank Bisignano's staff meeting with managers.",
      "The newly sworn-in head of the Social Security Administration told agency staff this week that when he was first offered the job in the Trump administration, he wasn't familiar with the position and had to look it up online.",
      "Frank Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive, said during a town hall with Social Security managers from around the country on Wednesday that he wasn't seeking a position in the Trump administration when he received a call about leading the SSA.",
      "\"So, I get a phone call and it's about Social Security. And I'm really, I'm really not, I swear I'm not looking for a job,\" Bisignano said, according to an audio recording of the meeting obtained by ABC News. \"And I'm like, 'Well, what am I going to do?' So, I'm Googling Social Security. You know, one of my great skills, I'm one of the great Googlers on the East Coast.\"",
      "\"I'm like, 'What the heck's the commissioner of Social Security?'\" said Bisignano, who now oversees one of the largest federal agencies that's responsible for distributing retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "\"Put that as the headline for the Post: 'Great Googler in Chief. Chief in Googler' or whatever,\" said Bisignano, who throughout the meeting repeatedly bemoaned media leaks from within the agency.",
      "While Bisignano, who previously served as chairman and CEO of financial technology company Fiserv Inc., brings experience managing large organizations and overseeing complex payment systems to his new role, he has no prior history working in government or with the Social Security system.",
      "A Social Security official told ABC News that Bisignano is \"working to transform the agency into a premier service organization.\"",
      "\"He is visiting offices and meeting employees to hear their ideas for how the agency can better serve customers in-person, on the telephone, and online,\" the official said. \"As the Commissioner evaluates the agency, he has been clear that SSA will have the right staffing to deliver Americans their hard-earned benefits.\"",
      "\"Clearly, Commissioner Bisignano was poking fun at himself so that everyone in the room felt comfortable having an open conversation about improving service for the American people,\" the official added.",
      "White House spokesperson Liz Huston, in a statement to ABC News, said, \"Commissioner Bisignano brings a valuable and much-needed outside perspective to the Social Security Administration. Commissioner Bisignano's proven success in the financial services industry uniquely positions him to lead the Trump Administration's commonsense efforts to modernize the agency and improve its efficiency.\"",
      "In Wednesday's 90-minute call, Bisignano sought to calm concerns about the future of the agency amid recent leadership turnover and scrutiny from Elon Musk's government-slashing Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "He told the managers in the meeting that Social Security was \"not going away,\" adding that President Trump also agrees with that.",
      "\"This is America's, you know, safety net -- it's not going away. And hopefully you hear me say this every day,\" he said. \"You know who wants me to tell people that? Guess. The president.\"",
      "\"I've gotten notes about, 'Will the turmoil of the last five months end? Are you here to cause more turmoil?'\" he said. \"I don't think it's the turmoil of the past five months, although I will be the fifth since, you know, November, right?\" Bisignano said, referring to being the fifth person put in charge of the critical agency since Trump was reelected in November.",

      "Bisignano told the managers that they needed to believe that DOGE was \"helping to make things better\" even if \"it may not feel that way.\"",
      "\"Who's heard of DOGE? Raise your hand, right? Your bias has to be, because mine is, DOGE is helping make things better. It may not feel that way, but don't believe everything you read.\"",
      "He said DOGE would be involved in rebuilding the Social Security website and integrating artificial intelligence into the agency's phone support systems.",
      "The head of the agency also told managers that the SSA must adopt a \"digital-first\" mindset to meet the expectations of the American public, comparing the agency to how consumers interact with tech giants like Amazon.",
      "\"You're competing with experiences that people have with Amazon, right? So if I could get something done at Amazon, why can't I get something done the same way with Social Security? That's how people think.\"",
      "Bisignano's officially joins the agency following months of upheaval at the SSA, which has seen a revolving door of leadership amid DOGE's sweeping efforts to overhaul the agency by modernizing its operations and cutting costs. Among the changes DOGE is pushing are staff reassignments, digital infrastructure overhauls, and the controversial outsourcing of certain administrative functions, according to sources.",
      "Bisignano also said he does not intend to implement reductions in force, or RIFs, at the agency, at least for now. \"I have no intent to RIF people, OK? Because that's the big question,\" he said.",
      "When the Wall Street veteran was named Trump's pick to lead the agency, he faced backlash from Democrats and activists who claimed his selection threatened the future of the Social Security program. In early May, lawmakers, union leaders, and activists protested his selection outside the U.S. Capitol ahead of the Senate vote on his nomination.",
      "On Wednesday's call, Bisignano appeared to revel in the news.",
      "\"Did you guys know there was a protest against me? Who knows there was a protest against me?\" he said. \"I like that protest -- I want to prove them so wrong, man, this is going to be most fun I ever had.\"",
      "\"I mean, think of that -- a poor boy from Brooklyn, from a multi-generational household with a dad who worked in the federal government, and senators picketing that I'm going to ruin it,\" he said. \"No way -- make it great, right?\"",
      "Bisignano, during the call, returned several times to his concerns about leaks to the press, suggesting that he would sniff them out.",
      "\"My father was a DA and I'm a detective at heart, so I can figure stuff out,\" he said.",

      "Trump celebrated the passage of what he called \"THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL\" in a social media post, calling it the \"most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country!\"",
      "He said it fulfilled his campaign promise of \"No Tax on Tips and No Tax on Overtime.\" He also recognized the tax deductions when consumers purchase an American-made vehicle, funding for the Golden Dome defense system, and the \"TRUMP Savings Accounts\" incorporated in the legislation.",
      "\"Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Leadership, and thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill!,\" Trump wrote.",

      "The \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" passed early Thursday morning by a single vote after marathon talks this week. It now heads to the Senate.",
      "The legislation extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boost spending for the military and border security -- while making some cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other assistance programs.",
      "It will also add about $3.8 trillion to the federal government's $36.2 trillion in debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).",
      "The CBO's preliminary analysis of the bill, requested by House Democrats and completed before it was passed by the House, estimated the lowest-income Americans will see their resources decrease while the country's highest earners would see an increase.",
      "\"This is not one big, beautiful bill. It's ugly,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote in a post on X on Thursday morning.",
      "\"There's nothing beautiful about stripping away people's healthcare, forcing kids to go hungry, denying communities the resources they need, and increasing poverty,\" the New York Democrat said.",

      "\"Unfortunately, we are here today discussing a bill that would make that American dream harder to reach for millions by increasing costs for families, hardworking American families, and gutting the things that they would need to survive and thrive,\" Jeffries said.",
      "On Medicaid, the Republican bill would implement new work requirements -- targeting able-bodied adults and immigrants, among other beneficiaries -- to kick in no later than the end of 2026 (three years earlier than originally proposed). It also incentivizes states to not expand Medicaid. The CBO estimated it would result in $698 billion less in federal subsidies because of changes to the Medicaid program.",
      "The early CBO estimates put the number of people who could lose coverage at more than 8 million -- but that number continues to fluctuate and the CBO has not yet released its final score of the GOP bill as it continues to be negotiated.",
      "Republicans have defended the moves as trying to remove \"waste, fraud and abuse\" within the program amid a broader administration effort to find savings within the federal government. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Thursday called the work requirements \"commonsense\" and claimed changes to Medicaid will protect benefits for the \"most vulnerable Americans.\"",
      "On SNAP, the megabill would cut the nutrition assistance program by $230 billion, according to CBO estimates. Millions of Americans rely on SNAP for benefits to supplement their grocery budget to afford nutritious food. Adults between the ages of 55 and 64, as well as children, would face additional work requirements to qualify for SNAP benefits.",
      "Several Democrats accused Republicans of rushing the bill in overnight hearings and session to hide such potential impacts from the public.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, during the House Rules Committee's 1 a.m. hearing, asked Republicans what they were \"afraid of.\"",
      "\"It's a simple question that speaks to the heart of what's going on here, and one that I'm going to keep on asking: if Republicans are so proud of what is in this bill, then why are you trying to ram it through in the dead of night?\" he said.",
      "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, called the GOP bill \"Robin Hood in reverse\" during a speech on the House floor Wednesday.",
      "\"This is fiscal engineering to reduce the role of government in the lives of the American people where it most needed, where it is most needed,\" Pelosi said. \"This is Robin Hood in reverse ... Taking resources from where it is most needed, people who need it most, and giving it those who need it less: the billionaires in America. This is shameful and it is a fraud.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the White House and Republicans are touting the elimination of taxes on tips and overtime pay, a key pledge during Trump's 2024 campaign to provide relief to working-class families. The elimination applies to workers who make less than $160,000 a year.",
      "The current bill raises the deduction limit of state and local taxes from federal income tax filings from $10,000 to $30,000 for joint filers making less than $400,000 per year.",
      "Trump's tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would be made permanent and the bill does not include a tax increase on the wealthiest earners.",
      "One notable change hammered out in negotiations among Republicans was raising the SALT deduction to $40,000 for incomes under $500,000 -- a substantive change from the $10,000 cap that was implemented in the 2017 tax law.",
      "The White House on Thursday promoted the bill as \"the largest tax cut in American history for middle-class families, the working class and small businesses.\"",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's Army parade includes 34 horses, two mules, one wagon and a dog named Doc Holliday.",
    "story": [
      "Doc is part of an Army horse cavalry unit from Texas.",
      "When the Army celebrates its 250th birthday on June 14, a date that just so happens to be President Donald Trump's 79th birthday, the streets of Washington, D.C., will be filled with marching troops and tanks as World War II airplanes and Vietnam War-era helicopters swoop overhead.",
      "Also included in the parade will be 34 horses, two mules, one wagon and a dog.",
      "Army Col. Kamil Sztalkoper, a spokesman for the III Armored Corps, said the dog is a Blue Heeler (aka an Australian Cattle Dog) named \"Doc Holliday\" -- likely a nod to the famous gunslinger played by Val Kilmer in the movie \"Tombstone.\"",
      "Doc joined the Army's 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment at Fort Cavazos, Texas, more than two years ago as a young puppy, Sztalkoper said. Part of the unit, which is used mostly for community events, is a wagon pulled by two mules. Doc rides in the back of the wagon.",
      "\"This is nothing for him. He's used to parades,\" said Sztalkoper, noting that Doc has participated twice already in the Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. And while Doc falls \"definitely in the sweet and playful category,\" Sztalkoper said he \"knows his place very well when it's time for the parade.\"",
      "Doc and his unit plan to depart Texas on June 10 so they can reach Washington in time to participate in the Army parade four days later.",
      "Doc's trip to the nation's capital is part of a massive effort underway by the Army -- and Trump -- to mark the service's milestone birthday with a weeklong festival and parade that includes some 6,700 soldiers. Planning for the celebration has been under way for close to two years, according to officials. It wasn't until this year following Trump's inauguration, however, that officials began exploring options to make the event even bigger with a parade.",
      "Trump had sought a military parade in his first term, but the effort was scrapped after costs topped $90 million.",
      "The final cost of this year's event is unknown. While the Army is estimated to spend up to $45 million to deploy troops and equipment, the celebration is expected to require considerable security on par with a large-scale event like the Super Bowl or presidential inauguration.",
      "Though Army officials said there are no plans for any of the eight bands participating in the parade to sing \"happy birthday\" to Trump, the Golden Knights will parachute onto the White House Ellipse and offer the president a folded American flag. After the parade, Trump will also administer the constitutional oath to 250 Army enlistees.",
      "\"It is a lot of money, but I think that amount of money is dwarfed by 250 years of service and sacrifice that American soldiers have given this country,\" Army spokesman Steve Warren said.",
      "\"We're looking at this as an opportunity to really strengthen the connection between America and her Army,\" he added. \"So, yeah, it's a lot of money, but it pales in comparison to what we're selling.\"",
      "The event isn't the first military parade in Washington, though it is likely to be the biggest. The U.S. military under President George H.W. Bush held a victory parade in June 1991 following the Persian Gulf War.",
      "Army officials said the parade is designed to tell the history of the Army, starting with troops wearing Revolutionary War garb. As the parade enters the World War II era, troops will march alongside period jeeps and an M4 Sherman tank while a B-25 Mitchell bomber aircraft, Douglas C-47 Skytrain transport plane and four North American P-51 Mustang fighter-bombers buzz overhead. More recent conflicts will be represented with Army UH-1 Huey, AH-1 Cobra, AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook helicopters.",
      "Also included in the parade are 28 M1 Abrams tanks, 28 Stryker vehicles and six Paladin self-propelled howitzers.",
      "The Army on Wednesday began loading the tanks on to rail cars from its base in Fort Cavazos to make the trek to Washington, D.C. in coming weeks. The tanks will be shipped to Jessup, Maryland, before being loaded onto trucks and driven to a staging area in Washington near the Lincoln Memorial.",

    "summary": "The top investors in President Trump's meme coin are attending an exclusive gala with the president -- but some critics are blasting it as a brazen pay-for-play event.",
    "story": [
      "Investors pumped millions into the coin for a chance to attend the gala.",
      "Hundreds of the top investors in President Donald Trump's cryptocurrency meme coin gathered Thursday for an exclusive black-tie dinner with the president -- what some critics are condemning as a brazen pay-for-play event meant to enrich the most powerful man in the world.",
      "Among those spotted arriving at the event were Lamar Odom of the NBA and \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" fame, cryptocurrency mogul Justin Sun and Kendall Davis, an Austin-based cryptocurrency investor, who told ABC News that he \"came here to advocate for things to be done right in the crypto space.\"",
      "Two hundred and twenty cryptocurrency traders, including many from overseas, pumped tens of millions of dollars into Trump's meme coin to gain admission to the gala through a contest that awarded invitations to the top investors -- with at least some of the funds flowing directly into the Trump family's coffers.",
      "Promoted on the coin's website as the \"most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the world,\" the glitzy affair at Trump's private golf club in Northern Virginia Thursday night was headlined by the president himself.",
      "Critics of the gala, including some Republican lawmakers and cryptocurrency industry advocates, have lambasted the arrangement as an opportunity for the president and his family to improperly benefit personally from his position of power.",
      "Outside of the event, dozens of protesters -- including Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- were seen bearing signs that read, \"America is not for sale,\" \"No King\" and\u00a0\"Stop Trump's Crypto Corruption,\" and chanting slogans of a similar sentiment as attendees made their way into the venue.",
      "\"It definitely seems like Trump is selling access to the president through his meme coin, and that money is going directly to his pocket,\" said Molly White, an engineer and crypto researcher who has closely followed Trump's various crypto ventures. \"[Trump] is really using cryptocurrency to boost his personal wealth in ways that he really had not previously done.\"",
      "Trump's meme coin -- a type of digital currency that's often based on an internet meme -- was launched in January, on the eve of his inauguration, and the coin's value immediately soared past $75 per token. But the coin, known as $TRUMP, suffered a precipitous drop in the ensuing weeks, bottoming out in April at around $7.",
      "That's when the gala was announced, framed online as an \"intimate private dinner\" where top investors in $TRUMP would \"hear first-hand President Trump talk about the future of crypto.\" The top 25 investors, the advertisement said, would also receive a \"special VIP tour\" and an exclusive reception with the president before the dinner.",
      "By the following day, the value of the coin ballooned by more than 55%. It then proceeded to fluctuate as those looking to secure admission to the gala bought up the coin and others looking to profit off the hype proceeded to sell",
      "As investors jockeyed for a spot on the venture's online leaderboard, the top 220 collectively spent upwards of $140 million for a seat at the table on Thursday, according to an analysis by the data analytics firm Nansen.",
      "Several investors said the opportunity to rub shoulders with the commander-in-chief -- and, in some cases, promote their business before the most powerful man in the world -- was worth the price of admission.",
      "Cherry Hsu, an executive at a Singapore-based blockchain startup called MemeCore, said the company's co-founder, known online as \"Ice,\" would attend the gala on the firm's behalf after MemeCore finished second in the competition. Hsu told ABC News that \"Ice\" was eager to speak with Trump about \"balancing regulation with decentralization\" in cryptocurrencies, and that their major investment in Trump's meme coin was directly tied to the opportunity to interact with the president.",
      "\"We want to sit next to Trump, if possible,\" she said. \"I think it will be interesting.\"",
      "Like \"Ice,\" most of the other gala attendees remain shrouded in mystery -- their identities hidden behind three-or four-letter pseudonyms connected to their cryptocurrency wallets -- and appear to be located outside the United States. At least 20 of the top 25 investors appear to be foreign-based, according to analysis from the left-leaning nonprofit research group Accountable.US.",
      "Among those who attended are an Australian entrepreneur, a New York-based crypto enthusiast, and Justin Sun, a controversial Chinese crypto mogul who has brokered deep business ties with the Trump family. In addition to his multimillion-dollar investment in $TRUMP, Sun has also invested $75 million in World Liberty Financial, another Trump-backed crypto venture. One month after that investment, SEC lawyers under the Trump administration moved to halt an alleged fraud case against Sun.",

    "story": [
      "After a bitter loss to President Donald Trump, former Vice President Kamala Harris is thinking hard about her next job",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Many of Kamala Harris\u2019 supporters and detractors alike think she'd have better odds running for California governor rather than president a third time.",
      "There are several reasons for Harris to make a bid to replace term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom. She would immediately become the early front-runner instead of entering a presidential primary with a dozen or more serious contenders. No other candidate in California could match her r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of having served as San Francisco district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president.",
      "Beyond being expected to make a decision by the end of summer, Harris said little about her future. She told a crowd in Orange County in April: \u201cI\u2019ll see you out there. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d",
      "Newsom has predicted that Harris would top the field in a contested primary but added, \u201cif she runs.\u201d",
      "To run for governor, \u201cyou have to have a burning \u2018Why?\u2019 \u201d Newsom said on the \u201cNext Up with Mark Halperin\u201d podcast.",
      "\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t enunciate that, the answer is \u2018No,\u2019\u201d Newsom added. \u201cWhy the hell would you want this job?\u201d",
      "Here are some reasons why she might want it \u2014 and why she might not. Her office did not respond to requests for comment for this story.",
      "Harris would have to convince national Democrats that she's the face of the party\u2019s future, despite losing to President Donald Trump last fall. She's also tied to former President Joe Biden, whom Democrats are increasingly criticizing as new books drive further discussion about his age and physical and mental readiness during his time in office.",
      "The 2028 presidential contest is expected to attract a large field, likely to include Newsom. Any candidate will have to unify a fractious Democratic Party with low approval ratings and struggling to slow Trump\u2019s agenda in Washington.",
      "Democratic consultant Bill Burton, who was national press secretary for former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, said Harris would enter a presidential primary with a proven fundraising network, strong recognition with voters and the experience of operating in a Trump-fueled media environment.",
      "But the looming question for Democrats is likely to be, \u201cWho is the best person to stand up to the MAGA movement and exhibit a strength that is going to need to be really formidable?\u201d Burton said.",
      "Could Harris make that case? Some think her time has passed.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s had her chance,\u201d Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cVoters want authentic outsiders who will shake up our broken political system and challenge an economic status quo rigged for billionaires against working people,\" Green added. \u201cThat\u2019s why Kamala Harris lost, and it\u2019s why Democrats must turn elsewhere for leadership.\u201d",
      "Harris calls herself a proud daughter of California, and after serving as vice president and in the Senate, she doesn\u2019t need to chase another title. That said, California is one of the world\u2019s largest economies by itself, and its governor becomes, by default, a national figure.",
      "She would most likely run as a proven hand with the experience to lead California\u2019s tussles with Trump \u2014 the state is known as the epicenter of the so-called Trump resistance \u2014 while dealing with its many problems, among them homelessness and a punishing cost of living.",
      "In her San Francisco speech last month, she said the nation was witnessing a \u201cwholesale abandonment\u201d of American ideals under Trump.",
      "The contest to replace Newsom in California is crowded, with leading candidates including former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Biden administration health secretary Xavier Becerra.",
      "It\u2019s expected that at least some of her rival Democrats would bow out rather than compete against her, including Porter, who in 2012 was appointed by then-attorney general Harris to be the state\u2019s independent bank monitor in a multibillion-dollar nationwide mortgage settlement.",
      "Democratic consultant Roger Salazar, who was a delegate in the party\u2019s 2024 presidential convention, said Harris would stand better odds in a race for governor in her home state.",
      "With multiple election wins in California, \u201cthere is just more certainty,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cI think she\u2019s got a leg up right now, but this race hasn\u2019t solidified\u201d with the primary more than a year away.",
      "How will voters view her? As a favorite daughter of California returning home? Or a two-time presidential also-ran looking for a soft landing?",
      "Republican consultant Kevin Madden, who was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, was dubious about her chances in either race. It's unusual for a candidate to capture the presidency after two losses \u2014 Biden was one example.",
      "As for governor, \u201cthe California electorate is about as ideal as it gets for Harris, but nothing about her current electoral record indicates that primary or general election candidates should be scared off,\u201d Madden added.",
      "Unlike many other states, California doesn't automatically advance a Democrat and a Republican to the November election.",
      "The state\u2019s open primary system has tormented many candidates \u2014 critics call it the \u201cjungle primary.\u201d All candidates appear on a single ballot, regardless of party, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election.",
      "The system can lead to strategic gambles. Last year\u2019s U.S. Senate race included three prominent Democrats \u2014 U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Porter and Barbara Lee. Schiff ran TV ads in the primary that spotlighted Republican Steve Garvey, presumably a weaker contender in the general election than either of his Democratic rivals. Garvey ended up advancing to November, where he was soundly defeated by Schiff, who now holds the seat.",
      "But Harris could come out of the June 2, 2026, primary facing a Democrat who ends up criticizing her in much the same way she'd have faced in a 2028 bid.",
      "San Francisco-based Democratic consultant Eric Jaye recalled another Californian who, after losing a presidential race, sought to rebound in his home state: Richard Nixon. After being narrowly defeated in the 1960 election by then-Sen. John F. Kennedy, Nixon lost the 1962 race for California governor. (Of course, Nixon ended up winning the White House six years later.)",
      "While Harris is a favorite with Democrats, a slice of the electorate has deeply negative views of her, Jaye noted. That doesn\u2019t leave her with many voters to gain, and the Democratic primary vote could be divided among multiple candidates.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s in any way guaranteed that she would win,\u201d Jaye said. \u201cShe\u2019s a highly polarizing figure.\u201d",
      "Harris would be coming home to a long list of problems.",
      "The homeless crisis is playing out daily on the streets of Los Angeles and other big cities. Newsom this month said the state is facing a $12 billion deficit and he wants to freeze enrollment in a state-funded health care program for immigrants living in California without legal status. There is a home insurance crisis and a continuing threat from destructive wildfires.",
      "And as the last election made clear, Republicans will attempt to saddle her \u2014 fairly or not \u2014 with her home state\u2019s reputation for confiscatory taxes, gas prices and utility bills, seven-figure home prices and liberal social policies.",

      "In his letter to Dr. O'Connor, Comer said they were seeking information, in part, to \"explore whether the time has come for Congress to revisit potential legislation to address the oversight of presidents\u2019 fitness to serve pursuant to its authority under Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment.\"",
      "The requests come as Biden revealed on Sunday that he was diagnosed with an \"aggressive\" form of prostate cancer.",

      "President Donald Trump, earlier this week, said Biden's cancer diagnosis was \"very sad\" -- though he also slammed his administration and questioned his use of the autopen (a mechanical device to automatically add a signature to a document that's been utilized by several past presidents, including Trump in his first term).",
      "\"The autopen. This government was illegally run for four years,\" Trump said.",
      "The House Oversight Committee previously requested that Dr. O'Connor and aides sit for interviews while Biden was president, but Biden blocked the request.",
      "\"Any continued obstruction will be met with swift and decisive action. The American people demand transparency and accountability now,\u201d Comer threatened.",

      "A Georgetown University scholar who was targeted for deportation by the Trump administration said he was terrified during his time in immigration jail",
      "ARLINGTON, Va. -- One of the lowest moments of Badar Khan Suri\u2019s two months in federal custody was being crammed onto an airplane with hundreds of other shackled prisoners.",
      "The Trump administration was trying to deport the Georgetown University scholar over statements he made against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza. The guards wouldn't say where they were headed, but the Indian national was convinced it was out of the United States.",
      "Then Khan Suri had to use the plane\u2019s bathroom. He said the guards refused to unshackle his wrists.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018No, you have to use it like this or do it in your trousers,\u2019\u201d Khan Suri recalled of the trip, taking him to a Louisiana detention center. \u201cThey were behaving as if we were animals.\u201d",
      "Khan Suri, 41, was released on bond last week as his lawsuit against the U.S.'s deportation case continues. In an interview with The Associated Press, he spoke Thursday of a cramped cell, crowded with other detainees, where he waited anxiously, fearful about what would happen next.",
      "He also addressed the Trump administration's accusations that he spread \u201cHamas propaganda.\u201d Khan Suri said he only spoke in support of Palestinians, who are going through an \u201cunprecedented, livestreamed genocide.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t support Hamas,\u201d he said. \u201cI support Palestine. I support Palestinians. And it is so deceiving for some people who just publish canards ... They will just replace Palestine with Hamas.\u201d",
      "Yet, because of his comments, he said U.S. authorities treated him as if he had committed a high-level crime. Fellow inmates said his red uniform was reserved for the most dangerous offenders.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2019No, I\u2019m just a university teacher. I did nothing,\u201d Khan Suri recalled.",
      "Still, there were rays of hope. He said more than a hundred people from the Georgetown community wrote letters on his behalf to the federal judge overseeing his case, including some who are Jewish.",
      "A crowd also greeted him when he arrived back in the Washington, D.C., area.",
      "\u201cHindus, Jews, Christians, Muslims \u2014 everyone together,\u201d said Khan Suri, a postdoctoral fellow who studies religion, peace and violence. \u201cThat is the reality I want to live with. That\u2019s the reality I want to die for. Those people together.\u201d",
      "U.S. Immigration authorities have detained international college students from across the country \u2014 many of whom participated in campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war \u2014 since the early days of Trump's second administration.",
      "The administration has said it revoked Khan Suri\u2019s visa because he was \u201cspreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media,\" while also citing his connections to \u201ca senior advisor to Hamas,\u201d which court records indicate is his wife Mapheze Saleh's father.",
      "Saleh is a Palestinian American whose father worked with the Hamas-backed Gazan government in the early 2000s, but before Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Khan Suri's attorneys have said. They also said he barely knew his father-in-law, Ahmed Yousef.",
      "Khan Suri\u2019s attorneys said he wouldn't comment on Yousef during Thursday\u2019s interview, which mostly covered his arrest and time in custody. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Khan Suri's statements.",
      "Khan Suri said he was arrested just after he taught his weekly class on minority rights and the majority. Masked police in plain clothes pulled up in an unmarked car outside his suburban Washington home.",
      "They showed no documents, he said. Other than saying his visa was being revoked, they refused to explain the reason for his arrest, which he described it as a \u201ckidnapping.\"",
      "\u201cThis is not some authoritarian regime,\u201d Khan Suri said. \u201cI was not in Russia or North Korea. I was in the best place in the world. So, I was shocked.\u201d",
      "As police whisked him away, Khan Suri realized they wanted to deport him.",
      "The \u201cdehumanizing procedures\u201d came next: A finger scan, a DNA cotton swab and chains binding his wrists, waist and ankles, he said. They also said he could talk to his wife at a detention center in Virginia, but \u201cthat never happened.\"",
      "He said he slept on a floor without a blanket and used a toilet monitored by a camera. The next day, he said he and other detainees were placed in a van, which soon rolled up to an airplane.",
      "\u201cI asked them where I am going now? Nobody would reply anything,\u201d Khan Suri said. \u201cThey just pushed us in.\u201d",
      "He said the bathroom situation did not get better at a federal detention center in Louisiana, where Khan Suri was taken next. It lacked a privacy barrier and was also watched by a camera.",
      "He was finally able to call his wife, but he said she couldn't hear him. Khan Suri said he was \u201cextremely terrified,\u201d thinking that someone was making his family not reply.",
      "He was not able to speak to a lawyer, while fellow inmates said everyone there is deported within three days, Khan Suri said.",
      "\u201cI was crying from inside, 'How can this be happening?\" he said. \u201cA few hours back, I was in Georgetown teaching my students, talking about peace and conflict analysis.\u201d",
      "Khan Suri said his first seven or eight days of captivity were the same: \u201cSame terror. Same fear. Same uncertainty. Same mockery of rule of law. Same mockery of due process.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was going more and more deeper, reaching to my abyss,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I was discovering that the abyss also has more and more depth.\u201d",
      "But he was still praying five times a day, uncertain which direction Mecca was.",
      "\u201cI was very strong like that, that God will help me. American Constitution will help me. American people will help me,\u201d he said.",
      "Afterward, Khan Suri was transferred to a detention facility in Texas, where he said he slept on the floor of a crowded cell for the first two weeks. Eventually, he got his own cot.",
      "And, finally, he was allowed to speak to his attorneys, which he said led to a change in treatment. Khan Suri, who is Muslim, soon received a Quran and then a prayer rug. As for the rug, he rolled it up like it was his young son.",
      "\u201cMy eyes would become wet, and I would give that blanket a hug as my son so that this hug should reach him,\u201d Khan Suri said. \u201cAnd when I came back, he told me the same, that he was hugging a pillow.\u201d",

      "The men who were placed on a deportation flight headed for the chaotic nation of South Sudan were originally from countries as far away as Vietnam",
      "The foreign men convicted of crimes who were placed on a deportation flight headed for the chaotic nation of South Sudan were originally from countries as far away as Vietnam. They had lived in various places from California to Iowa, Nebraska to Florida, with one serving a sentence of nearly 30 years.",
      "They were accused and convicted of crimes ranging from murder, to rape, robbery and assault.",
      "Despite their criminal records, a federal judge says the White House violated a court order on deportations to third countries, adding these eight migrants aboard the plane were not given a meaningful opportunity to object that the deportation could put them in danger.",
      "Judge Brian E. Murphy in Boston ordered a new set of interviews with the migrants, either back in the U.S. or abroad. Trump administration officials accused \u201cactivist judges\u201d of advocating the release of dangerous criminals.",
      "\u201cNo country on Earth wanted to accept them because their crimes are so uniquely monstrous and barbaric,\u201d said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "At least one of the victim's family members has come out to oppose the way the deportation was conducted and the fact that her family wasn't notified, while saying she had long hoped the man would leave the United States.",
      "These are the migrants who were part of the deportation flight.",
      "The only man from South Sudan on the flight was 33-year-old Dian Peter Domach. He was convicted in 2013 of robbery, for which he was sentenced to 8 to 14 years in prison; and of possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited person, for which he was sentenced to 6 to 10 years. Those sentences were to be served one after the other. The Department of Homeland Security said Domach was also convicted of driving under the influence.",
      "While in prison, he was convicted of \u201cassault by a confined person\u201d and sentenced to an additional 18 to 20 months. According to the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, Domach was released on \u201cdiscretionary parole\u201d on May 2 and arrested by immigration authorities six days later.",
      "Records said he represented himself on appeal and in the most recent prison assault case.",
      "One of the two deportees with life sentences is 48-year-old Thongxay Nilakout from Laos. He was convicted of killing a German woman and wounding her husband in 1994 when he was 17. The couple was visiting a popular tourist lookout east of Los Angeles during a trip to see their daughter.",
      "Nilakout was sentenced to life in prison but was released in 2023 after his case was reviewed following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that said mandatory life sentences for minors were unconstitutional. Nilakout was ordered removed to Laos by an immigration judge in 2023 and waived appeal, court records show.",
      "The couple's daughter, Birte Pfleger, is now a history professor at California State University, Los Angeles. She called it a \u201creal moral dilemma,\" explaining she is not happy with the way the deportation was conducted.",
      "\u201cNo matter which way you slice it, you cannot violate people\u2019s due process. That\u2019s a fundamental constitutional right that has existed for well over 250 years,\u201d she said.",
      "But she hopes the man chooses to return voluntarily to Laos. Pfleger said she filled out forms that she has to be notified of any changes in Nilakout's case, but wasn't notified when the man was arrested by immigration authorities in January or when he was put on the flight.",
      "\u201cHe supposedly had plans for that because he still has some relatives in Laos,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, guess what? Now\u2019s the time. Go call those relatives. Go home. Don't come back.\u201d",
      "Kyaw Mya, a man from Myanmar who lived in Iowa, was convicted of sexually abusing a child under 12 years of age and sentenced to 10 years in prison, according to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Mya was ordered removed by an immigration judge in 2021, and lost his appeal of that order in 2023, according to a statement from Marcos Charles, an assistant director of field operations with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, in a court filing late Thursday. He was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in February.",
      "An attorney for Mya did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.",
      "Nyo Myint, another Burmese deportee, lived in Lincoln, Nebraska. He was accused in 2017 of sexually assaulting a 26-year-old woman with \u201cdiminished mental capacity\u201d who ended up pregnant. The woman's sister said the victim had a mental capacity equal to a 3-year-old and that Myint had told her he was the child's father.",
      "An arrest affidavit filed by the police said Myint admitted to having sex with the woman at least two times, saying he knew her since 2003 and knew she had gone to a school for children with mental disabilities. He admitted he made a mistake and felt it was wrong to have sex with her.",
      "He was given a 12- to 14-year prison sentence in 2020 but released on probation in May 2023. He was ordered removed by an immigration judge that same year and waived appeal, court records show. ICE took custody of Myint in February.",
      "Nathan Sohriakoff remembers defending Myint in the Nebraska case and communicating with him via interpreters. He hadn't heard he was part of the deportee group, which Trump administration officials are calling \u201cbarbaric monsters.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was a small man, very petite. He didn\u2019t speak a word of English and didn\u2019t resist the charges,\u201d Sohriakoff said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember feeling like he was dangerous. My general feeling of him was that he was limited in his ability as well, like cognitively, but not to the degree that I felt he was incompetent.\u201d",
      "The Department of Homeland Security says the flight included a Vietnamese man. Tuan Thanh Phan was convicted of first-degree murder and second-degree assault and sentenced to 22 years in prison.",

Homeland Security officials say he was also convicted of homicide and armed robbery, but the records in Miami-Dade County did not include that. Arias-Hierro had already been ordered removed to Cuba by an immigration judge back in 1999, and did not file an appeal, court records show.",
      "The attorney who last served as his public defender in 2024 did not respond to an email and phone call seeking comment. Arias-Hierro was taken by ICE earlier this month.",
      "Immigration officials said in a court filing Thursday that Jose Manuel Rodriguez-Quinones was sentenced to 15 years in prison being convicted of arson in 2008 in Florida.",
      "Additional convictions for drug trafficking, being a felon in possession of a weapon, and possession of drug paraphernalia followed, said Charles, ICE's assistant director of field operations, in a statement filed in court. In 2022, he was convicted of attempted first-degree murder and sentenced to four years in prison, the document shows.",

      "CAMDEN, Del. -- Thousands of chicks found abandoned inside a postal service truck for three days have gone to new homes, according to the Delaware shelter that had cared for them, with the last batch picked up on Thursday morning.",
      "All the surviving birds, estimated as more than 5,000 chickens \u2014 it was too hard to get a specific count \u2014 plus some others like turkeys and quails, were primarily adopted by local families, rescues and farms, according to First State Animal Center and SPCA.",
      "The chicks were part of a 12,000-bird shipment left unattended in a truck at a Delaware mail distribution center. Trapped in high temperatures without food or hydration, thousands died, according to the state Department of Agriculture. The U.S. Postal Service has said it is investigating the \u201cprocess breakdown\u201d that occurred.",
      "For more than two weeks, the surviving birds had been cared for at an overwhelmed First State Animal Center and SPCA, said John Parana, executive director. As a no-kill operation, the shelter would not take adopters planning to use the birds for meat, Parana said. Some of the adopters took hundreds at a time, hoping for egg-laying hens, while others took them as pets.",
      "Stephanie Bruzdzinski adopted a handful of chicks after her daughter learned about their situation.",

      "North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong accidentally vetoed $35 million for the state\u2019s housing budget",
      "When North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong took up an agency budget bill approved by the legislature, he vetoed a couple line items. At least, that was his intention Monday. Instead, he accidentally vetoed $35 million for the state's housing budget.",
      "Now the state is figuring out how to deal with the unusual problem of a mistaken veto.",
      "\u201cI have no recollection of anything like this happening in the 37 years I've been here,\u201d John Bjornson, legislative council director, said Thursday. \u201cSo, yeah, I'd say it's a little extraordinary.\u201d",
      "The governor's staff called his veto of the housing budget in Senate Bill 2014 a markup error. Armstrong's staff met with the legislative council Thursday morning to discuss options.",
      "\"This was an honest mistake, and we will fix it,\u201d a statement from the governor's office read.",
      "Armstrong, a Republican who served three terms in Congress, was elected governor in 2024. The legislative session that adjourned earlier in the month was his first as governor.",
      "In a message accompanying the veto, Armstrong wrote he had intended to veto a $150,000 grant to fund a Native American homelessness liaison position. The budget veto would take effect July 1.",
      "What happens next is largely up to the governor, Bjornson said, but it is likely that the legislature will need to reconvene in Bismarck for a special session. The governor's office said it will call a special session if needed but hopes to \u201cavoid the expense.\u201d",
      "If the legislature overrides the veto, that would include funding for the grant Armstrong had wanted to strike. If the legislature wants to only fund the $35 million housing budget, lawmakers may need to pass a new bill, which could take as long as three days, Bjornson said.",
      "The Legislature has six days available to use of its 80-day session limit, and a special session could open the opportunity to override other vetoes by the governor. The governor vetoed all or parts of four bills this session.",

      "Five organizations that had grants terminated by the Justice Department in April are suing the department and Attorney General Pam Bondi, arguing that the cancellations are unconstitutional and asking that the money be reinstated.",
      "The lawsuit, filed late Wednesday by the Vera Institute of Justice, the Center for Children & Youth Justice, Chinese for Affirmative Action, FORCE Detroit and Health Resources in Action, asks a federal judge in the nation's capital to \u201cdeclare unlawful, vacate and set aside\u201d the cancellations that were sent to more than 360 awardees ending grants worth nearly $820 million midstream.",
      "The lawsuit filed by the Democracy Forward Foundation and the Perry Law firm asks for class action status and also names the Office of Justice Programs and Maureen Henneberg, the acting head of that office, as defendants.",
      "The lawsuit argues that the grant terminations did not allow due process to the organizations, lacked sufficient clarity, and that Henneberg's office lacked \u201cconstitutional, statutory, and regulatory authority\u201d to terminate the grants. The lawyers also argue that the move violated the constitutional separation of powers clause that gives Congress appropriation powers.",
      "The lawsuit notes that all the grant recipients that had money rescinded received the same form letter announcing the cancellation, with identical words saying the grant programs no longer met the agency's priorities.",
      "Lawyers argue in the lawsuit that the new agency priorities noted in the form letter are not articulated in policy or law, and that federal regulations do not allow for cancellations when the agency\u2019s priorities change \u201cpost-award.\u201d They said the rule only allows for cancellations of grants that no longer meet the agency\u2019s goals as stated when the grants were awarded.",
      "The lawsuit says the Office of Justice Programs \u201cis permitted to terminate an award based on agency priorities only if that basis for termination was specifically permitted by the terms and conditions of the award.\u201d That did not happen, it argues.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment Thursday on the lawsuit.",
      "Representatives from Vera said the nonprofit received notice on April 4 that five awards worth more than $7 million were being canceled. The other named plaintiffs, along with hundreds of other groups, received identical notices on April 22 that they should cease any activities under the grants and that they would lose access to the federal funding system.",
      "The grants cover a wide swath of programing across the Justice Department. Among other goals, they are for community violence intervention work, combatting hate crimes, providing assistance to crime survivors and survivors of domestic or sexual abuse, improving juvenile justice, and training for law enforcement agencies.",
      "The lawsuit says none of the organizations had previously had grants terminated and many had received grants for various programs under both Democratic and Republican presidential administrations.",
      "Many of the organizations that lost the federal money said the unexpected cancellations mid-grant had meant layoffs, program closures and loss of community partnerships. In addition to staying the cancellations and reinstating the awards, lawyers also ask a judge to require state reports every 30 days to ensure compliance.",
      "\"The sudden and unlawful termination of these public safety grants makes neighborhoods everywhere less safe and does irreparable harm to communities across the country,\u201d said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward.",

      "The U.S. Mint has made its final order of penny blanks and plans to stop producing the coin when those run out",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration says making cents doesn't make sense anymore.",
      "The U.S. Mint has made its final order of penny blanks and plans to stop producing the coin when those run out, a Treasury Department official confirmed Thursday. This move comes as the cost of making pennies has increased markedly, by upward of 20% in 2024, according to the Treasury.",
      "By stopping the penny's production, the Treasury expects an immediate annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs, according to the official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the news.",
      "In February, President Donald Trump announced that he had ordered his administration to cease production of the 1-cent coin.",
      "\u201cFor far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!\u201d Trump wrote at that time in a post on his Truth Social site. \u201cI have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\u201d",
      "There are about 114 billion pennies currently in circulation in the United States \u2014 that's $1.14 billion \u2014 but they are greatly underutilized, the Treasury says. The penny was one of the first coins made by the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792.",
      "The nation's treasury secretary has the authority to mint and issue coins \u201cin amounts the secretary decides are necessary to meet the needs of the United States.\u201d",
      "Advocates for ditching the penny cite its high production cost \u2014 almost 4 cents per penny now, according to the U.S. Mint \u2014 and limited utility. Fans of the penny cite its usefulness in charity drives and relative bargain in production costs compared with the nickel, which costs almost 14 cents to mint.",
      "The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.",
      "Pennies are the most popular coin made by the U.S. Mint, which reported making 3.2 billion of them last year. That\u2019s more than half of all the new coins it made last year.",
      "Congress, which dictates currency specifications such as the size and metal content of coins, could make Trump\u2019s order permanent through law. But past congressional efforts to ditch the penny have failed.",
      "Two bipartisan bills to kill the penny permanently were introduced this year.",
      "Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., introduced the Make Sense Not Cents Act this month. In April, Reps. Lisa McClain, R-Mich., and Robert Garcia, D-Calif., along with Sens. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., introduced the Common Cents Act.",
      "Jay Zagorsky, professor or markets, public policy, and law at Boston University, said that while he supports the move to end penny production, Congress must include language in any proposed legislation to require rounding up in pricing, which will eliminate the demand for pennies.",
      "Zagorsky, who recently published a book called \u201cThe Power of Cash: Why Using Paper Money is Good for You and Society,\" said otherwise simply ditching the penny will only increase demand for nickels, which are even more expensive, at 14 cents to produce.",
      "\u201cIf we suddenly have to produce a lot of nickels \u2014 and we lose more money on producing every nickel \u2014 eliminating the penny doesn't make any sense.\u201d",

      "A Tennessee man who killed his wife and her two teenage sons is facing execution, three years after he was saved by a last-minute reprieve",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee man who killed his wife and her two teenage sons was scheduled to be executed on Thursday morning, three years after he was saved by a last-minute reprieve.",
      "Oscar Smith, 75, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection of the barbiturate pentobarbital at 10:10 a.m. Smith has always claimed to be innocent, and in an interview with The Associated Press recently, he primarily wanted to discuss the ways he felt the court system had failed him.",
      "He was convicted of fatally stabbing and shooting his estranged wife, Judith Smith, 13-year-old Jason Burnett and 16-year-old Chad Burnett at their Nashville, Tennessee, home on Oct. 1, 1989. He was sentenced to death by a Davidson County jury in July 1990 for the murders.",
      "In 2022, a Davidson County Criminal Court judge denied requests to reopen his case despite some new evidence that the DNA of an unknown person was on one of the murder weapons. The judge wrote that the evidence of Smith\u2019s guilt was overwhelming and the DNA evidence did not tip the scales in his favor.",
      "Tennessee executions have been on hold for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by the Tennessee Department of Correction.",
      "Smith came within minutes of execution in 2022 before he was saved by a surprise reprieve from Republican Gov. Bill Lee. It later turned out the lethal drugs that were going to be used on him had not been properly tested. A subsequent yearlong investigation turned up numerous other problems with Tennessee executions.",
      "The Correction Department issued new guidelines for executions in December. The new execution manual contains only a single page on the lethal injection chemicals with no specific directions for testing the drugs. It also removes the requirement that the drugs come from a licensed pharmacist. Smith\u2019s attorney, Amy Harwell, has characterized it this way: \u201cIt\u2019s as if, having been caught breaking their own rules, TDOC decided, \u2018Let\u2019s just not have rules.\u2019\u201d",
      "The new protocols are the subject of a lawsuit filed by Smith and other death row inmates. A trial in that case is set for next January.",

      "The NATO Parliamentary Assembly, a transatlantic forum of about 300 parliamentarians from the organization's 32 member nations, arrives in Dayton for their five-day meeting at a time when the Trump administration has cast doubt over whether the U.S. would defend NATO allies in Europe without them committing larger percentages of their budgets to defense spending.",
      "It is the first time since 2003 that the event has been held in the United States.",
      "Organizers are framing the 30th anniversary of the 1995 accords \u2014 negotiated at Dayton's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and signed in Paris later that year \u2014 as a celebration of peace and the power of diplomacy.",
      "The NATO Village in the heart of downtown Dayton is festooned with flags of NATO nations, and a host of cultural activities have been planned alongside formal parliamentary proceedings, including art and history exhibits and a series of free lectures open to the public. A Concert for Peace, featuring musicians from symphonies in both Dayton and Sarajevo, will be performed on May 29.",
      "\u201cThere's an excitement in the air,\u201d said Chris Kershner, president and CEO of the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, not only for our community, but for everybody who\u2019s working on it. So everybody is truly excited ... They know they're part of history happening right here.\u201d",
      "Natalie Hudson, a political science professor and executive director of the Human Rights Center at the University of Dayton, said hosting the deal that ended the horrific violence, weaponized rape and ethnic cleansing that had marked the long-running conflict between Bosnia, Serbia and to a lesser extent Croatia in the early 1990s helped shape the city's character.",
      "\u201cDayton and Daytonians were very aware at the time of what was happening at Wright-Patt Air Force Base,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were prayer vigils. Sarajevo became a sister city to Dayton, and quite a bit of a connection was made. And that idea of Dayton being a city of peace really settled in, and we take great pride in that here in the city.\u201d",
      "That spirit led to the establishment of The International Peace Museum in the city, perhaps the only museum of its kind in the U.S., she said.",
      "Hudson is among a host of speakers who will participate in \u201cThe Dayton Dialogue: Conversations about Peace and Security in the Balkans,\u201d four days of panel discussions to be held at the University of Dayton's Roger Glass Center for the Arts in tandem with the assembly.",
      "Also planned to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the Dayton Peace Accords is the Think Freedom project, an installation that combined art, history and community engagement. The Old Montgomery County Courthouse will host an exhibit called \u201cDayton Around the World,\u201d featuring artifacts and stories celebrating the city's history, which includes being home to the aviation-pioneering Wright brothers.",
      "Gatherings of this magnitude also require security planning. Demonstrators on many sides of the issues could show up to picket or march. The city has spent over $700,000 to rent the fencing and barricades to place around the NATO Village and summit venue downtown, which are closed to the public through Sunday.",
      "Kershner said plans are in place to ensure safety.",
      "\u201cDayton\u2019s well prepared to host events like this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a great Dayton Police Department. We\u2019ve worked very closely with Ohio State Highway Patrol, with Homeland Security, with other law enforcement agencies to make sure that everybody\u2019s going to be safe, secure, and well-protected.\u201d",

      "The number of white nationalist, hate and anti-government groups around the U.S. dropped slightly in 2024, not because of any shrinking influence but rather the opposite. Many feel their beliefs, which includes racist narratives and so-called Christian persecution, have become more normalized in government and mainstream discourse.",
      "In its annual Year in Hate and Extremism report, released Thursday, the Southern Poverty Law Center said it counted 1,371 hate and extremist groups, a 5% decline. The nonprofit group attributes this to a lesser sense of urgency to organize because their beliefs have infiltrated politics, education and society in general. Some of the ways they have done this are through pushing for bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, book bans and protests of drag story hours, the report says.",
      "Last year, there were 533 active hate groups. These include groups who express views that are anti-LBGTQ+, anti-immigrant, antisemitic and anti-Muslim. This number has been steadily declining since reaching a historic high of 1,021 in 2018.",
      "\u201cThe trends have slightly sort of gone up and down but let's just say generally, since our tracking, have increased. And that's not just on a total numbers level but also on a per capita,\u201d said Rachel Carroll Rivas, interim director of the SPLC\u2019s Intelligence Project.",
      "The number of anti-government groups last year totaled 838, an increase from recent years, according to the law center based in Montgomery, Alabama, that tracks racism, xenophobia and far-right militias. These groups see the federal government as \u201ctyrannical\u201d and include militias and self-described sovereign citizens.",
      "Male supremacy also continues to emerge as an influential hate group. The SPLC documented seven new male supremacist hate groups, making the total 16. Their rhetoric espouses misogyny and strict gender roles. Their rising influence came during an election year when the country saw a woman of color be the first presidential nominee for a major political party.",
      "\u201cI'm not sure it's a direct result of the candidacy of Kamala Harris,\u201d Rivas said. However, SPLC researchers went into chat rooms of white supremacist organizations during the election and found \u201cintense vilification, the claiming of demonization of Harris as well as just the pushing of the idea falsely that women would not be qualified.\u201d",
      "Some people on the far right have also pushed a belief that white Christian culture is being threatened by a \u201cdemographic crisis\u201d including fewer births.",
      "\u201cPoliticians, pundits and provocateurs on the right have turned toward demonic language to tar those who disagree with them,\u201d the report states.",
      "Last year's report found \u201crecord numbers\u201d of white nationalist and anti-LGBTQ groups in 2023. The analysis highlighted how far-right groups tried to waylay democracy through disinformation, false conspiracy theories and threats to election workers. It also examined how supporters of Christian supremacy used similar topics to organize a movement toward authoritarianism.",
      "The SPLC is a liberal advocacy organization that, besides monitoring hate groups, files lawsuits over justice issues and offers educational programs to counter prejudice. Frequently criticized by conservatives as biased, the nonprofit has faced lawsuits for its designation of some organizations as hate groups.",
      "The report's release comes as a Los Angeles college professor made an appearance in front of media and supporters a few weeks after he was severely injured in a hit and run that he reported as a hate crime. Aki Maehara, 71, arrived at the Chinese American Museum in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday morning in a wheelchair but was able to walk himself to a podium.",
      "\u201cAll of your support, concern and care has helped to speed up my healing and has helped to raise my spirits,\u201d Maehara told the crowd.",
      "Photos of his injuries posted to a GoFundMe page have been shared multiple times on social media with users calling for hate crime charges. The crowdsourcing campaign has raised almost $80,000 for Maehara as of Thursday.",
      "Maehara said he is considering directing some of the funds \u201cto other victims of Asian hate violence and other victims of racist violence who are currently in need of support.\"",
      "\u201cI am wanting to add my voice to efforts to address fascist, racist violence directed against Asian Pacific Islander Americans, immigrant communities, all targeted communities and individuals during our current crisis,\" he said.",
      "Maehara was riding his electric bicycle in Montebello, 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles, on April 29 when he says heard a driver yell a racial slur. Maehara says a car then struck him and the driver fled. He was hospitalized with a concussion, neck injury, cheek bone fracture, bruises and swelling up and down his body among other injuries.",
      "Maehara, who is Japanese American, teaches a course on the history of racism in the U.S. at East Los Angeles College. He returned to the classroom last week, according to multiple outlets.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The man accused of fatally shooting two staff members of the Israeli Embassy in Washington outside a Jewish museum told police after his arrest, \u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza,\" federal authorities said Thursday in announcing charges in the killings they called a targeted act of terrorism.",
      "Elias Rodriguez, 31, shouted \u201cFree Palestine\u201d as he was led away after his arrest, according to charging documents that provided chilling new details of the Wednesday night attack in the nation's capital that killed an American woman and Israeli man who had just left an event at the museum. They were set to become engaged.",
      "The stunning attack prompted Israeli missions to beef up their security and lower their flags to half-staff. It came as Israel pursues another major offensive in the Gaza Strip in the war with Hamas that has heightened tensions across the Middle East and internationally, and that law enforcement officials have repeatedly warned could inspire violence in the U.S.",
      "Rodriguez faces charges of murder of foreign officials and other crimes and did not enter a plea during a perfunctory court appearance. Additional charges are likely, prosecutors said, as authorities continue to investigate the killings as both a hate crime against the Jewish community and terrorism.",
      "\u201cViolence against anyone based on their religion is an act of cowardice. It is not an act of a hero,\u201d said Jeanine Pirro, the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. \u201cAntisemitism will not be tolerated, especially in the nation\u2019s capital.\u201d",
      "The two people killed were identified as Yaron Lischinsky, an Israeli citizen, and Sarah Milgrim, an American. They were a young couple about to be engaged, according to Yechiel Leiter, the Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Friends, colleagues and former professors paid tribute to the pair Thursday as having dedicated themselves to promoting peace and aspiring to bridge cultural and religious divides.",
      "\u201cSarah and Yaron were stolen from us,\u201d said Ted Deutch, the chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, which organized the event. \u201cMoments before they were murdered, they were smiling, laughing and enjoying an event with colleagues and friends. We are in shock and heartbroken as we attempt to process this immense tragedy.\u201d",
      "An FBI affidavit made public Thursday presents the killing as calculated and planned, with authorities alleging that Rodriguez flew to the Washington region from Chicago on Tuesday with a handgun in his checked luggage. He purchased a ticket for the event about three hours before it started, the affidavit said.",
      "The couple were leaving the Capital Jewish Museum when the suspect, who witnesses said had been behaving suspiciously by pacing outside the museum, approached a group of four people and opened fire. Surveillance video showed Rodriguez advancing closer to the two victims as they fell to the ground, leaning over them and firing additional shots. He even appeared to reload before jogging off, the FBI said.",
      "After the shooting, the suspect went inside the museum and stated that he \u201cdid it.\u201d He was no longer armed by the time he was taken into custody, according to the affidavit.",
      "\u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza, I am unarmed,\u201d he spontaneously said. He also told detectives that he admired an active-duty Air Force member who set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in February 2024, describing the man as \u201ccourageous\u201d and a \u201cmartyr,\u201d court documents said.",
      "Investigators said they were still working to corroborate the authenticity of writings purported to be authored by Rodriguez, an apparent reference to a document circulating online that expressed outrage over Israel's conduct in the war. The FBI is also contacting associates, family members and coworkers.",
      "Rodriguez appeared in federal court in Washington in a white jail suit and listened impassively as the charges and possible punishments, which include the death penalty, were read. At a home listed in public records for Rodriguez\u2019s mother in suburban Chicago, a sign taped on the door Thursday afternoon asked for privacy.",
      "The shooting followed the Jewish advocacy group's annual Young Diplomats reception at the museum, which the couple had attended.",
      "Yoni Kalin and Katie Kalisher were inside the museum when they heard gunshots, and a man came inside looking distressed. Kalin said people came to his aid and brought him water, thinking he needed help, without realizing he was the suspect. When police arrived, he pulled out a red keffiyeh, the Palestinian headscarf, and repeatedly yelled, \u201cFree Palestine,\u2019\u201d Kalin said.",
      "\u201cThis event was about humanitarian aid,\u201d Kalin said. \u201cHow can we actually help both the people in Gaza and the people in Israel? How can we bring together Muslims and Jews and Christians to work together to actually help innocent people? And then here he is just murdering two people in cold blood.\"",
      "Milgrim, from Overland Park, Kansas, was \u201cwarm and compassionate, committed to peace building and passionate about sustainability and people-to-people relations,\" Deutch said. A former youth director at Congregation Beth Torah recalled her as a brilliant girl with a perpetual smile and a sense of purpose.",
      "\u201cShe had a passion for Judaism and for Israel, and she wanted to do some good,\u201d said Marcia Rittmaster, the former youth director. She recommended Milgrim for a Jewish leadership internship upon the young woman\u2019s graduation from high school.",
      "Lischinsky grew up partly in the German city of Nuremberg and moved to Israel at 16. He served in the Israeli military \u201cand chose to dedicate his life to the state of Israel,\u201d said Ron Prosor, who taught Lischinsky at Israel\u2019s Reichman University. Lischinsky earned a master\u2019s degree in government, diplomacy and strategy there.",
      "\u201cHe embodied the Judeo-Christian values and set an example for young people worldwide,\u201d Prosor said on X.",
      "A friend, David Boskey, recalled Lischinsky as someone unafraid to broach hard questions in order to interrogate his own convictions. He met Lischinsky in 2017 in Jerusalem at a Messianic Jewish congregation, where they would often end up talking together about life and faith, Boskey said.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- The Archdiocese of New Orleans agreed to pay nearly $180 million to victims of clergy sexual abuse under a settlement announced Wednesday, the latest in a string of settlements by the Catholic Church.",
      "The archdiocese, its parishes and several insurers will pay $179.2 million into a trust to benefit survivors, according to a statement by the committee that negotiated the agreement. The money will be distributed after the church emerges from bankruptcy, it said.",
      "But many of the survivors were not on board, their lawyers said.",
      "\u201cThis proposed settlement was made in a secret backroom deal that the Archdiocese, the creditors committees and the mediators knew the overwhelming majority of victim-survivors would never agree to and will undoubtedly vote down,\u201d attorneys Soren Gisleson, Johnny Denenea and Richard Trahant said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cIt makes no sense and is a continuation of the lifetime of abuse the Archdiocese has inflicted on these folks.\u201d",

      "Aaron Hebert, who says he was abused by a priest in the 1960s as an eighth grader, called the deal \u201can insult and a slap to the face.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Archdiocese of New Orleans and Archbishop (Gregory) Aymond are throwing this offer out to prevent victims and survivors from taking their claims to state court,\u201d Hebert said.",
      "The committee's statement said the deal also includes what it called \u201cunprecedented\u201d provisions and procedures to safeguard against future abuse and provide services to survivors, including a survivors\u2019 bill of rights and changes to the Archdiocese\u2019s process for handling abuse claims.",
      "\u201cI am grateful to God for all who have worked to reach this agreement and that we may look to the future towards a path to healing for survivors and for our local church,\u201d Aymond said in a statement.",

      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Treasured artifacts associated with President Abraham Lincoln were on the auction block Wednesday, separated from a collection that was intended to be available for public display forever but wound up in the middle of an interagency feud amid a lingering $8 million debt.",
      "The blood-stained leather gloves that were in Lincoln's pocket the night he was assassinated were among the 144 items up for bid, 136 of which sold. They were auctioned to pay off the remainder of a two-decade-old loan that the Lincoln Presidential Foundation used to buy a one-of-a-kind cluster of Lincoln artifacts from a California collector.",
      "The auction at Freeman's/Hindman in Chicago raised $7.9 million, but that includes buyers' premiums of roughly 28% tacked onto each sale to cover the auction house's administrative costs.",
      "The gloves were the top-selling items, bringing in $1.52 million including the premium. One of two handkerchiefs Lincoln had with him April 14, 1865, the night he was shot, went for $826,000.",
      "A \u201cWanted\u201d poster featuring photos of three suspects in the assassination conspiracy, led by John Wilkes Booth, sold for $762,500, far higher than the top estimated price of $120,000.",
      "And the earliest known sample of the 16th president's handwriting, from a notebook in 1824, fetched $521,200.",
      "Phone and email messages seeking comment were left for the foundation. Its website said proceeds from the auction would be put toward retiring the debt and \u201cany excess funds will go toward our continued care and display of our extensive collection.\u201d",
      "The foundation purchased a 1,540-item assemblage in 2007 from Louise Taper for the fledgling Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, which opened in 2005 in the city where he established a law practice and lived while serving in the Illinois Legislature and briefly in Congress.",
      "The artifacts were supposed to give the library and museum, which was rich in Lincoln-related manuscripts, a boost in what it lacked \u2014 the meaty kind of curios that draw tourists.",
      "But fundraising was slow, forcing the sale of non-Lincoln portions of the collection and threats by the foundation to sell more before it finally extended the loan.",
      "In 2012 a controversy arose over what had been the crown jewel of the group \u2014 a stovepipe hat, appraised at $6 million, that Lincoln was said to have given as a gift to a southern Illinois supporter. That story came under intense scrutiny, as reported by the Chicago Sun-Times, resulting in a 2019 study that found there was no evidence the hat belonged to Lincoln. It was not part of Wednesday\u2019s auction.",

      "Carrying out mass deportations was a key rallying cry during Donald Trump\u2019s campaign for the presidency",
      "WASHINGTON -- Carrying out mass deportations was a key rallying cry during Donald Trump's campaign for the presidency. Since the day he was sworn into office, his administration has focused on how to make that rallying cry reality.",
      "They've touted their policy of going after \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d \u2014 meaning people who've committed crimes in America \u2014 while leaning on some nations to take migrants who the U.S. has difficulty deporting to their own countries.",
      "They've removed protections from hundreds of thousands of people the Biden administration admitted on a temporary basis into the country with the aim of eventually making them deportable.",
      "Here's a look at the strategies that the Trump administration is using, how they're targeting people for deportation and some of the challenges they're running into:",
      "Immigration enforcement officials have repeatedly portrayed their initial efforts as going after people they describe as \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d Those are people who pose public safety or national security threats, people who've been arrested or convicted of committing crimes in America or who ICE determines are gang members.",
      "On their social media feeds, they posted a constant stream of photos of people arrested by ICE and crimes they\u2019re alleged to have committed.",
      "Previous administrations have also prioritized people who are considered public safety threats so that strategy isn't necessarily new.",
      "What is different under the Trump administration is that ICE agents now have authority to arrest other people they find with immigration violations when they're going after \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d These are called \u201ccollateral arrests\u201d and they weren't allowed under the Biden administration. As one ICE agent described it: \u201cNobody gets a free pass anymore.\u201d",
      "Immigration enforcement officials have long complained about countries that do not take their citizens back when the U.S. has determined they can be deported.",
      "Some countries don\u2019t take back any of their citizens. Others are selective, especially when it comes to people with criminal convictions or who\u2019ve committed particularly egregious crimes. And according to a 2001 Supreme Court ruling, ICE cannot hold someone for more than six months if there is no reasonable chance to expect they can be sent back to their home country.",
      "Historically that has meant that immigration enforcement officials have had to release people into the U.S. that it wants to deport but can't.",
      "To get around this problem, the Trump administration has leaned on other countries to accept people who are not their own citizens. The most high profile of these deals was announced in February by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a trip to El Salvador. That country has taken Venezuelans that the U.S. alleges are gang members and is holding them at a notorious prison.",
      "Costa Rica and Panama have also taken citizens who are not their own although they were not imprisoned. Many of them have gone home or moved to third countries.",
      "Outside of those three Central American nations, the Trump administration has said it\u2019s exploring other third countries for deportations. More recently there's been indications the U.S. may be trying to send people to Libya or South Sudan.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to strip protections from hundreds of thousands of people admitted into the U.S. on a temporary basis during the Biden administration. This could eventually make those people subject to deportation.",
      "The Democratic president's administration admitted nearly 1.5 million people through two key programs that use a legal tool known as humanitarian parole to admit people into the country.",
      "Separately the Biden administration also dramatically expanded the number of people who were protected from deportation by Temporary Protected Status. That is a designation that allows people already living in the United States to stay and work legally for up to 18 months if their homelands are unsafe because of civil unrest or natural disasters.",
      "The Trump administration is moving aggressively to remove or terminate all of those protections. If successful \u2014 and much of these efforts are being litigated \u2014 it could potentially open up hundreds of thousands of people to be removed.",
      "There are millions of people in the country illegally including about 1.1 million with final orders of removal but only about 6,000 deportation officers. Those are the officers tasked with finding, arresting and removing people who don't have the right to be in the country.",
      "So in addition to actively trying to find and remove people, the Trump administration wants people to leave voluntarily.",
      "Through aggressive social media and television campaigns, they're encouraging people in the country illegally to go home, saying that otherwise they could face fines and never be allowed back into America.",
      "They're also offering $1,000 and air fare to people who self-deport.",
      "Earlier this week, the Department of Homeland Security touted the first flight of people who took up that offer to return to Honduras.",

      "Investigators in Tennessee say a fire that severely damaged a historic Black church that served as the headquarters for a 1968 sanitation workers\u2019 strike which brought the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Memphis was intentionally set",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A fire that severely damaged a historic Black church that served as the headquarters for a 1968 sanitation workers\u2019 strike, which brought the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Memphis, was intentionally set, investigators said Wednesday.",
      "The fire at the Clayborn Temple, which was undergoing a yearslong renovation, was set in the interior of the church, the Memphis Fire Department said in a statement. Investigators are searching for a person suspected of being involved with the blaze.",
      "Flames engulfed the downtown church in the early hours of April 28. Later that day Memphis Fire Chief Gina Sweat said the inside of the building was a total loss but there was still hope that some of the facade could be salvaged.",
      "The fire department said May 14 that the building had been stabilized and investigators would use specialized equipment to study the fire\u2019s cause.",
      "Located just south of the iconic Beale Street, the Clayborn Temple was built in 1892 as the Second Presbyterian Church and originally served an all-white congregation. In 1949 the building was sold to an African Methodist Episcopal congregation and given its current name.",
      "Before the fire it was in the midst of a $25 million restoration project that aims to preserve the architectural and historical integrity of the Romanesque revival church, including the revival of a 3,000-pipe grand organ. The project also seeks to help revitalize the neighborhood with a museum, cultural programing and community outreach.",
      "King was drawn to Memphis in 1968 to support some 1,300 predominantly Black sanitation workers who went on strike to protest inhumane treatment. Two workers had been crushed in a garbage compactor in 1964, but the faulty equipment had not been replaced.",
      "On Feb. 1 of that year, two more men, Echol Cole, 36, and Robert Walker, 30, were crushed in a garbage truck compactor. The two were contract workers, so they did not qualify for worker\u2019s compensation, and had no life insurance.",
      "Workers then went on strike seeking to unionize and fighting for higher pay and safer working conditions. City officials declared the stoppage illegal and arrested scores of strikers and protesters.",
      "The Clayborn Temple hosted nightly meetings during the strike, and the movement\u2019s iconic \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d posters were made in its basement. The temple was also a staging point for marches to City Hall, including one on March 28, 1968, that was led by King and turned violent when police and protesters clashed on Beale Street. One person was killed.",
      "When marchers retreated to the temple, police fired tear gas inside and people broke some of the stained-glass windows to escape. King promised to lead a second, peaceful march in Memphis, but he was shot by a sniper while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel on April 4.",
      "After King was assassinated and the strike ended with the workers securing a pay raise, the church\u2019s influence waned. It fell into disrepair and was vacant for years before the renovation effort, which took off in 2017 thanks to a $400,000 grant from the National Park Service.",
      "The Clayborn Temple was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. A memorial to the sanitation workers, named \u201cI AM A MAN Plaza,\u201d opened on church grounds in 2018.",
      "Anasa Troutman has been leading the restoration as executive director of Historic Clayborn Temple and founder of a nonprofit associated with the church, called The Big We. About $8 million had been spent on the renovations before the fire, and the exterior had been fully restored, Troutman said.",
      "She said in a recent interview that two chimneys had to be demolished before investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives could safely work on the property, but the church organ had been removed before the fire.",
      "As the fire was burning, she said, people went to the \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d memorial and stood at a wall where the names of the striking sanitation workers are listed.",
      "\u201cI watched that wall turn into the Wailing Wall, because people were literally getting out of their cars, walking up to that wall and wailing, staring at the building on fire,\u201d she said.",

      "A federal judge in Florida has rejected arguments made by an artificial intelligence company that its chatbots are protected by the First Amendment \u2014 at least for now",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A federal judge on Wednesday rejected arguments made by an artificial intelligence company that its chatbots are protected by the First Amendment \u2014 at least for now. The developers behind Character.AI are seeking to dismiss a lawsuit alleging the company\u2019s chatbots pushed a teenage boy to kill himself.",
      "The judge's order will allow the wrongful death lawsuit to proceed, in what legal experts say is among the latest constitutional tests of artificial intelligence.",
      "The suit was filed by a mother from Florida, Megan Garcia, who alleges that her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III fell victim to a Character.AI chatbot that pulled him into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Meetali Jain of the Tech Justice Law Project, one of the attorneys for Garcia, said the judge's order sends a message that Silicon Valley \u201cneeds to stop and think and impose guardrails before it launches products to market.\u201d",
      "The suit against Character Technologies, the company behind Character.AI, also names individual developers and Google as defendants. It has drawn the attention of legal experts and AI watchers in the U.S. and beyond, as the technology rapidly reshapes workplaces, marketplaces and relationships despite what experts warn are potentially existential risks.",
      "\u201cThe order certainly sets it up as a potential test case for some broader issues involving AI,\u201d said Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky, a law professor at the University of Florida with a focus on the First Amendment and artificial intelligence.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that in the final months of his life, Setzer became increasingly isolated from reality as he engaged in sexualized conversations with the bot, which was patterned after a fictional character from the television show \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d In his final moments, the bot told Setzer it loved him and urged the teen to \u201ccome home to me as soon as possible,\u201d according to screenshots of the exchanges. Moments after receiving the message, Setzer shot himself, according to legal filings.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Character.AI pointed to a number of safety features the company has implemented, including guardrails for children and suicide prevention resources that were announced the day the lawsuit was filed.",
      "\u201cWe care deeply about the safety of our users and our goal is to provide a space that is engaging and safe,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Attorneys for the developers want the case dismissed because they say chatbots deserve First Amendment protections, and ruling otherwise could have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on the AI industry.",
      "In her order Wednesday, U.S. Senior District Judge Anne Conway rejected some of the defendants' free speech claims, saying she's \u201cnot prepared\u201d to hold that the chatbots' output constitutes speech \u201cat this stage.\u201d",
      "Conway did find that Character Technologies can assert the First Amendment rights of its users, who she found have a right to receive the \u201cspeech\u201d of the chatbots. She also determined Garcia can move forward with claims that Google can be held liable for its alleged role in helping develop Character.AI. Some of the founders of the platform had previously worked on building AI at Google, and the suit says the tech giant was \u201caware of the risks\u201d of the technology.",
      "\u201cWe strongly disagree with this decision,\" said Google spokesperson Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda. \"Google and Character AI are entirely separate, and Google did not create, design, or manage Character AI\u2019s app or any component part of it.\u201d",
      "No matter how the lawsuit plays out, Lidsky says the case is a warning of \u201cthe dangers of entrusting our emotional and mental health to AI companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a warning to parents that social media and generative AI devices are not always harmless,\" she said.",

      "Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of rape and physical abuse. The suit also said Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the footage.",
      "\"After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,\" Ventura said in a statement to CBS News at the time. \"With the expiration of New York's Adult Survivors Act fast approaching, it became clear that this was an opportunity to speak up about the trauma I have experienced and that I will be recovering from for the rest of my life.\"",
      "Combs later apologized for the behavior seen on the video, but denied the allegations in the lawsuit. In a social media post that has since been removed, he said he was \"f---ed up\" and \"hit rock bottom.\"",
      "\"I take full responsibility for my actions in that video,\" he said. \"I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now. I went and I sought out professional help. I got into going to therapy, going to rehab. I had to ask God for his mercy and grace. I'm so sorry. But I'm committed to be a better man each and every day. I'm not asking for forgiveness. I'm truly sorry.\"",
      "One day after the suit was filed, a settlement was announced. While the details were not disclosed, Ventura said in a statement, \"I have decided to resolve this matter amicably on terms that I have some level of control.\"",
      "Combs' defense attorneys said in their opening statements that he and Ventura hadn't seen each other since his ex, Kim Porter's, funeral in 2018.",
      "Ventura is now married and pregnant with her third child. Her husband, trainer Alex Fine, and her brother were both seen in court for support.",
      "\"Over the past five days, the world has gotten to witness the strength and bravery of my wife freeing herself of her past,\" Fine said in a statement, going on to say, \"I did not 'save Cassie' as some have said. To say that is an insult to the years of painful work my wife has done to save herself. Cassie saved Cassie.\"",
      "Who are Diddy's other accusers?",
      "Since 2023, dozens of women and men have filed lawsuits against Combs alleging sexual and physical abuse.",
      "Many of the accusers said they were drugged and then abused while incapacitated, and some claimed other celebrities were present or participated in the abuse.",
      "However, the majority of those allegations are not part of the criminal case. Prosecutors have chosen to focus on allegations where there is physical evidence or witness corroboration.",
      "The other three women involved in the trial have not been publicly named and they are expected to testify using pseudonyms. The indictment refers to them as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Jurors are expected to hear from one woman who the defense says had a three-year relationship with Combs that also turned jealous and violent, as well as former employees and an assistant.",

      "Other high-profile names in the Sean Combs case",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they were familiar with a list of some 190 celebrities, including Michael B. Jordan, Kanye West and Mike Myers, though it wasn't clear how those people are related to the trial, if at all. Ventura testified about dating Jordan, as well as Kid Cudi.",
      "The judge overseeing the case is U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian, a Columbia Law School graduate and former clerk for the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. President Joe Biden appointed Subramanian as a federal judge in 2022.",
      "The prosecution team is made up of eight assistant U.S. attorneys, seven of them women. They include Maurene Ryan Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was one of the prosecutors in the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring Jeffrey Epstein to recruit and sexually abuse teenage girls.",

    "summary": "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify medical exceptions under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S.,",
    "story": [
      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill Wednesday to clarify\u00a0medical exceptions\u00a0under one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the U.S., putting the GOP-backed proposal on the brink of reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.",
      "The changes would not expand abortion access in Texas or list specific medical exceptions under the state's near-total ban, which took effect in 2022 and only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. It also would not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "But the proposal is still a pivot for Texas\u00a0Republicans, who for years have defended the law as written in the face of legal challenges and pleas for clarity from medical providers.\u00a0Democrats, meanwhile, have called the bill a positive step but also faced criticism from some abortion-rights allies who raised doubts about what, if any, impact it will have.",
      "The bill would specify that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It also defines a \"life-threatening\" condition as one capable of causing death.",
      "Senate Bill 31\u00a0passed 129-6 and needs only a final procedural vote before reaching Abbott, who has signaled support for the measure.",
      "North Texas doctor has mixed feelings toward the bill",
      "Three years ago, Dr. Austin Dennard traveled outside Texas for an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a fatal condition. She later testified in a lawsuit about how the state's near-total ban on abortion put her health at risk.",
      "Dennard's feelings are mixed about the bill, which does not list specific medical conditions or include fatal fetal anomalies as exceptions.",
      "\"What is broadly now known among practicing physicians in Texas is that abortions are illegal,\" said Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas. \"Undoing that broad understanding is going to be difficult.\"",
      "Moves to clarify medical exemptions",
      "Lawmakers in at least nine states with abortion bans have sought to change or clarify medical exceptions that allow doctors to perform an abortion if the mother's life is at risk since Roe v. Wade was overturned\u00a0nearly three years ago, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Supporters of these bills have said they have the potential to save lives. Critics, including some abortion rights groups, have questioned whether they make state abortion laws easier to understand.",
      "In Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year vetoed a bill that GOP lawmakers touted as bringing clarity to that state's near-total abortion ban, saying it would not protect pregnant women. Republican lawmakers later overrode his veto.",
      "Last year, South Dakota released a video for physicians that outlined examples of acceptable medical emergencies, which received criticism from abortion rights supporters for not being specific enough.",
      "\"I think these bills are trying to get at the reality that exceptions are really hard to comply with,\" said Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy adviser at the Guttmacher Institute.",
      "Still, Texas Republican Sen. Bryan Hughes, an architect of the state's abortion ban, said the new bill's goal is to avoid confusion among doctors.",
      "\"One of the most important things we want to do is to make sure that doctors and hospitals and the hospital lawyers are trained on what the law is,\" Hughes said.",
      "Navigating exceptions under abortion bans",
      "In 2024, the Texas Supreme Court ruled against Dennard and a group of women who said they were denied abortions after experiencing serious pregnancy complications that threatened their lives and fertility. The court ruled that the state's laws were clear in allowing doctors to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.",
      "Texas' efforts underscore the challenges abortion opponents have had to navigate regarding medical exceptions, said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law and a historian of abortion politics in the U.S.",
      "Judges have put enforcement of Utah's abortion ban on hold in a case over exceptions, for example, and they struck down two Oklahoma bans over medical exceptions \u2013 though most abortions in that state remain illegal.",
      "For abortion opponents, Ziegler said, it's tricky to craft legislation that does two different things.",
      "\"Can you provide clear guidance as to when medical intervention is justified without providing physicians discretion to provide abortions they don't think are emergencies?\" Ziegler said.",
      "Texas may advance other anti-abortion laws",
      "Texas' ban prohibits nearly all abortions, except to save the life of the mother, and doctors can be fined up to $100,000 and face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an abortion illegally.",
      "Attorney General Ken Paxton's office has filed criminal charges against a midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions and is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",
      "Texas Republicans are also advancing efforts to make it a civil offense to mail, deliver or manufacture abortion pills, expanding on a 2021 law that allows private individuals to sue others whom they suspect are helping a woman obtain an abortion.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 12:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The FDA is requiring COVID vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna to update their warnings about the possible risk of myocarditis and pericarditis.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is telling Pfizer and Moderna to expand the warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines about the risk of a possible heart injury side effect linked to the mRNA shots, primarily in teen boys and young men, citing findings from a study published last year and new agency data.",
      "Orders to expand the warnings were posted Wednesday by the FDA, in letters dated April 17 to Pfizer and BioNTech about their Comirnaty vaccine and Moderna about its Spikevax vaccine.",
      "Both vaccines previously carried warnings about how the risk of the heart side effects \u2014 which doctors call myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane surrounding the heart) \u2014 looked to be higher in young men, generally within the first week after vaccination. While the earlier labels specified ages 18 to 24 years old for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 years old for Pfizer's, the new warning will apply to males ages 16 to 25 for both vaccines.",
      "\"Following administration of the 2023-2024 Formula of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, the highest estimated incidence of myocarditis and/or pericarditis was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" the FDA says in the new blanket warning it will require for both vaccines.",
      "The rate of myocarditis and pericarditis was around 8 cases per million doses for children and adults under 65 years old after use of that season's vaccines, the FDA says.",
      "The new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the \"highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age,\" with a rate of 38 cases per million.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously described rates of myocarditis and pericarditis as rare after COVID-19 vaccination.",
      "CDC officials told the agency's vaccine advisers last month that acute myocarditis \"tends to resolve quickly\" after vaccination, and no increased risk had been seen in data from recent seasons in people 12 to 39 years old.",
      "It is unclear whether Pfizer or Moderna disputed the order. They had \"within 30 calendar days of the date of this letter\" to try to rebut the demand. Spokespeople for Moderna and Pfizer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"Americans deserve radical transparency around the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines and the FDA is delivering on their promise to do just that. Moderna and Pfizer should take steps to ensure that individuals are aware of COVID vaccine-related adverse events resulting in myocarditis and pericarditis,\" Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, told CBS News in an email. Nixon did not explain why the letters were posted more than a month after they were written.",
      "They appeared on the FDA's website hours ahead of a hearing organized by the Republican-led Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on \"how health officials downplayed and hid myocarditis and other adverse events associated with the COVID-19 vaccines.\"",
      "Aaron Siri, an attorney who worked closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in the past to call on the FDA to pull COVID-19 and other vaccines and vet nominees during the transition, is among the witnesses.",
      "The FDA says the warnings were spurred by new data from the agency's safety surveillance system and results published in October from scientists following up with people who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.",
      "Talks about this kind of safety labeling change began before the ouster of the FDA's previous top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, multiple people familiar with the situation said, but had not yet been finalized as officials wrestled with how to accurately present the findings. Marks left the FDA on April 5.",
      "Scientists in that study followed up with people who had faced chest pain and elevated amounts of troponin in their blood, a protein that usually signals some kind of heart damage. They were predominantly young adolescent males.",
      "\"While their clinical course was nearly always mild with a low prevalence and extent of cardiac dysfunction, myocardial injury was common,\" the scientists wrote in the study, which was co-authored by FDA officials.",
      "Similar to what the study described, the FDA's new warning also says that the heart MRI findings showed \"improvement over time in most people.\"",
      "\"It is not known if these heart MRI findings might predict long-term heart effects of myocarditis. Studies are underway to find out if there are long-term heart effects in people who have had myocarditis after receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine,\" the FDA said.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration says it has decided to continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and others at higher risk of severe disease, but will require vaccine makers to conduct major new clinical trials before approving them for wider use. The decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall.",
      "\"I think we have to admit to ourselves that America is deeply divided on the policy issue of repeat COVID-19 vaccine doses or boosters,\"\u00a0Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA's new top vaccines official, said in a video posted by the agency announcing the change.",
      "Details of the new rules for COVID-19 vaccine approvals were also outlined in\u00a0an article\u00a0published by The New England Journal of Medicine, authored by Prasad and FDA Commissioner Dr. Martin Makary.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct \"randomized, placebo-controlled trials\" before the FDA will approve future applications to give shots to \"all healthy persons\" between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old, they wrote.",
      "Otherwise, companies will only be able to get their routine COVID-19 vaccine updates approved for seniors as well as people with an underlying medical condition, like pregnancy or diabetes, that increases the risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The range of diseases in the CDC definition of high risk of severe disease is vast, including obesity and even mental health conditions such as depression. Estimates suggest that 100 million to 200 million Americans will have access to vaccines in this manner,\" they wrote.",
      "Vaccine makers are being urged to run new randomized studies in adults between the ages of 50 and 64, where they believe the balance of benefits and risks is uncertain. Prasad said they are also encouraging new trials in children under 5.",
      "\"I think we have a really good balance between vulnerable people, that people still at high risk will still have a rapid path to access, but people at average risk and low risk, they need evidence,\" said Prasad.",
      "Makary and Prasad criticized the U.S. for adopting \"a one-size-fits-all regulatory framework\" to grant broad authorization for past COVID-19 vaccine boosters in the past, and cited poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "They also pointed to other developed countries that have already limited annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters to only older adults and those with underlying conditions that increase their risk of severe disease.",
      "\"The U.S. policy has sometimes been justified by arguing that the American people are not sophisticated enough to understand age- and risk-based recommendations. We reject this view,\" they wrote.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0told \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday that these guidelines are essentially taking away the option to get a booster for some.",
      "\"Up until now, people have been opting, do they want to (get a booster), do they not? Now, if you're under 65, you may not be able to get an updated booster,\" she said. \"They are requiring clinical trials that, quite frankly, because of how long it takes, how expensive they are, it's very unlikely that they would happen in time for an updated booster for those younger age groups.\"",
      "While requiring these clinical trials may seem like a more evidence-based approach, Gounder said she's skeptical.",
      "\"There's a little double speak going,\" she said, adding typically, there would be a publicly shared systematic review of all vaccine data ahead of a change like this. \"What you got here was a two and a half page paper, which was really a policy opinion piece, in the New England Journal of Medicine in a town hall meeting. Normally, when you have a big change like this at the FDA, this is done much more transparently.\"",
      "The new \"regulatory framework for COVID-19 vaccination\" laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes ahead of a key meeting of the agency's outside vaccine advisers this Thursday, to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has greenlit those updates in a process similar to the annual flu shots, based largely on laboratory data showing the vaccines can trigger antibody levels similar to previously approved shots.",
      "That is a lower bar than requiring brand new randomized trials of the vaccines tested against a placebo to show it prevents symptomatic disease \u2014 a process which is usually only required for new shots when there is no currently approved immunization available.",
      "But Makary and Prasad said COVID-19 shots should be held to a different standard, citing differences in how the virus mutates and the immunity offered by vaccines and previous infection.",
      "\"Ultimately, these studies alone can provide reassurance that the American repeat-boosters-in-perpetuity strategy is evidence-based,\" they wrote.",
      "It is unclear whether and when vaccine makers would be able to conduct these kinds of trials, if they wanted to try again for a broader approval from the FDA. Makary and Prasad floated the possibility of trials as soon as the coming months.",
      "\"Covid-19 has summer transmission that can facilitate the conduct of randomized studies that continue to apply in future time periods,\" they wrote.",
      "Prasad said interim results from some of the studies could be ready \"by next calendar year.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 19:23:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to release a report Thursday on how pesticides and other issues may be linked to childhood chronic diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought Tuesday to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S.",
      "\"I have said repeatedly throughout this process, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business,\" Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"There's a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model.\"",
      "The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a \"Make America Healthy Again Commission,\" which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.",
      "Targets include the \"potential over-utilization of medication, certain food ingredients, certain chemicals, and certain other exposures\" in children. Kennedy said their report was due to be released Thursday.",
      "\"Your information about the report is just simply wrong,\" Kennedy told Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi in response to a question about the report. \"The drafts that I've seen, there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.\"",
      "Hyde-Smith had told Kennedy that she was \"deeply concerned\" that the report will \"unfairly target American agriculture, modern farming practices and the crop protection tools\" that U.S. farmers use.",
      "\"We all know what confirmation bias is. It's no secret that you were involved with pesticide litigation, prior to becoming secretary,\" Hyde-Smith told Kennedy.",
      "What has RFK Jr. said about pesticides like glyphosate?",
      "Kennedy has criticized the use of several pesticides in the U.S. food supply, including as an environmental attorney during court battles with chemical manufacturer Monsanto over accusations that its widely-used weedkiller Roundup \u2014 made from the chemical glyphosate \u2014 was causing cancer.",
      "\"If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luther. I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value,\" Kennedy wrote in a 2020 Facebook post.",
      "During his longshot independent presidential campaign, Kennedy pledged to get toxins out of the food supply, warning that \"toxic chemicals like glyphosate\" were widely contaminating what Americans were eating.",
      "He continued that criticism in the months ahead of the 2024 election as he stumped in support of President Trump, recalling how his son resolved his \"really agonizing\" eczema by switching to eating pasta made in Europe.",
      "\"As soon as he comes back here and he eats the pasta in this country, he gets eczema,\" he told Donald Trump Jr. on a podcast in September of last year. \"And you know, they don't have the glyphosate like we do, that is sprayed on the wheat at harvest time. So it's going right into the food.\"",
      "What will be in RFK Jr.'s \"MAHA Commission\" report?",
      "One of Kennedy's top HHS advisers, Calley Means \u2014 whose sister Dr. Casey Means was nominated by President Trump earlier this month for the surgeon general post \u2014 said that the report is aimed at outlining \"obvious\" ways that children are \"being poisoned through areas that there's not even that much scientific disagreement on.\"",
      "\"Obviously, it's because of environmental toxins,\" Means said, speaking at a May 15 event hosted by the Kennedy-aligned MAHA Institute. \"We produce and ingest 25% of the world's pesticides. The leading herbicides and pesticides that we use in the United States, many of them are phased out or banned in every other country in the world.\"",
      "Means said that the report was not intended to result in \"a European nanny state system\" to crack down on pesticides, pledging instead to come up with \"pro-innovation policies to solve this issue\" under Kennedy. He blasted lobbyists for opposing the report's release.",
      "Beyond \"environmental toxins\" like pesticides, Means listed a number of other issues he alleges are making American children sick, including ultra-processed foods, added sugars, seed oils, sedentary behavior, lack of sleep, overprescriptions and vaccines.",
      "\"They're saying it's going to scare the American people to get facts out. They're putting so much pressure on President Trump, so much pressure on Secretary Kennedy to not release facts,\" Means said last week.",
      "What power does RFK Jr. have over pesticides?",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services does not directly set the limits on how glyphosate and other pesticides are used. That is left up to the Environmental Protection Agency. However, HHS does oversee the major research that underpins how the EPA regulates chemicals.",
      "Studies into pesticides like glyphosate to inform the EPA's limits often come from the federal health agencies within HHS.",
      "For example, the National Institutes of Health's National Toxicology Program published results in 2023 suggesting that glyphosate is \"unlikely\" to be genotoxic, which had been one of the main ways international experts previously suspected it might cause cancer.",
      "Results from a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published in 2022 found that diet was likely a factor in how much glyphosate people were being exposed to, based on urine samples taken in adults and children.",
      "Through the Food and Drug Administration, Kennedy also has authority over how glyphosate levels in food are tracked and the EPA's limits are enforced.",
      "The last round of published sampling by the FDA in 2022 found that 54 samples of human food had detectable amounts of glyphosate out of 731 analyzed. Corn and beans were among the most frequent detections.",

      "A Twin Cities woman is suing over an alleged medical mistake that she says cost her a healthy left kidney.",
      "In a lawsuit filed Friday, Wendy Rappaport of Plymouth accuses the surgeon and the Allina hospital system of medical malpractice and battery. Allina says the court filings \"don't accurately reflect the full picture\" and intends to fight the suit in court.",
      "Rappaport was admitted to Abbott Northwestern in March 2022 and was scheduled for a spleen removal surgery, the lawsuit says. After the doctor recommended the surgery, the suit says he reviewed the risk of procedure with her.",
      "The lawsuit says that the doctor performed an open laparotomy procedure, during which Rappaport's \"left kidney was removed instead of her spleen.\" In a post-operative note, the doctor said he removed an intact spleen during the surgery, but a post-operative CT scan showed her left kidney had been removed, and the spleen tissue was still present, the lawsuit says.",
      "Before the surgery, a CT scan showed that Rappaport's kidneys were \"unremarkable. No suspicious masses, stones, or hydronephrosis,\" according to the lawsuit. Rappaport did not consent to the removal of her left kidney, documents state.",
      "She stayed in the hospital until May 25, 2022 due to complications following the removal of the kidney, the suit says. She also now requires continued treatment, including dialysis, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit claims the doctor committed medical malpractice and medical battery. The lawsuit accuses him of breaching his duty of care he owed Rappaport and causing permanent, irreversible injury. The Allina health system also faces similar allegations, as the medical professionals involved in the surgery also owed her a duty of care, documents say.",
      "Rappaport is seeking at least $50,000 in the case.",
      "An affidavit filed by an Iowa City doctor says that the Allina surgeon \"deviated from the applicable standard of medical care owed to Ms. Rappaport.\"",
      "Failing to identify the left kidney during the procedure \"was a medical mistake\" and \"one that does not occur in the absence of negligence,\" he writes.",
      "\"Allina Health is aware of the lawsuit and has had the case reviewed by medical experts. While we will not discuss details of a patient's care due to privacy laws, the court filings don't accurately reflect the full picture of the patient's condition or the life-saving medical care provided. We intend to vigorously defend, in court, the care that was provided,\" Allina Health said in a statement.",
      "In a statement Tuesday afternoon, Rappaport's lawyers said:",
      "The Schmidt and Salita Law Team represents Wendy Rappaport for injuries she suffered as a result of the negligent and unnecessary removal of her left kidney. The Defendants were supposed to remove a \"sick\" spleen but removed the incorrect organ. As a result, Ms. Rappaport suffers not only the loss of her left kidney but also permanent kidney impairment, and she requires specific medical treatment to maintain her ongoing kidney function. This was not the case for Ms. Rappaport prior to the unnecessary kidney removal. On 5/16/2025, we commenced the lawsuit on Ms. Rappaport's behalf seeking fair compensation for her injuries and the future damages she will incur due to the Defendant's medical malpractice and medical battery. The removal of the incorrect organ has and will continue to have a profound and unnecessary impact on her life and health.",

    "summary": "\"As far as I know, we have not fired any working scientists,\" RFK Jr. had told Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Some of the National Institutes of Health's top brain scientists received layoff notices last month, weeks before Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified to Congress that no working scientists had been cut from his department.",
      "While the researchers were asked to continue working for a few more weeks in the labs they run at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, multiple sources familiar with the situation say their layoff notices have not been revoked.",
      "\"Most people believe we were reinstated because we got back to the office,\" one of the scientists, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News in a message.",
      "This means they still face termination from the federal government on June 2, alongside the thousands of other workers who were put on leave after Kennedy's layoffs were announced last month.",
      "\"These 11 labs have about 100 staff, mainly young trainees whose careers will be severely disrupted,\" one scientist familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "News of the Neurological Disorders and Stroke scientists losing their jobs was previously reported by The Transmitter.",
      "The laid-off scientists include Richard Youle. Youle, who has served at the NIH since 1978, carries the title of distinguished investigator, a designation reserved for the agency's most preeminent researchers. He was the winner\u00a0of the $3 million Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2021 for his research into Parkinson's disease.",
      "A scientist familiar with Youle's work, who spoke anonymously fearing retaliation, praised his research as a \"fundamentally important\" breakthrough for the field. Youle's results had paved the way for researchers to find new treatments for Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, the NIH said in its news release.",
      "One source at the NIH said Youle had received four job offers after news of the layoffs broke last month. Three were for positions outside the United States. While Youle has told others that he has no interest in leaving the U.S. for now, the source said it shows that \"the world is ready to pounce and take our top scientists if we don't fix this.\"",
      "Ten other senior investigators \u2013 Miguel Holmgren, Steve Jacobson, Dorian McGavern, Joseph Mindell, Katherine Roche, Zu-Hang Sheng, David R. Sibley, Kenton Swartz, Susan Wray and Ling-Gang Wu \u2013 were also laid off at NINDS, according to records shared with CBS News. A senior associate scientist at NINDS, Silvina Horowitz, got a layoff notice as well, the records show.",
      "Among the scientists who have received major recognition for their work in recent years include Wu, who was selected for a prestigious award in February from the Biophysical Society for his ongoing research on how neurons communicate and function. Sibley was recognized in 2023 by a pharmacology society for \"seminal contributions\" to understanding dopamine receptors in the brain.",
      "Kennedy had told a Senate health committee at a\u00a0hearing on May 14 that the only cuts they had made to date were \"administrative cuts.\"",
      "\"As far as I know, we have not fired any working scientists, the working scientists, the people who are actually doing science. There are some people who were scientists that were doing IT or administration, who did lose their jobs. But in terms of working scientists, our policy was to make sure none of them were lost and that that research continues,\" Kennedy said.",
      "NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya and senior leaders within the department were made aware weeks ago about the layoffs, multiple sources told CBS News. Bhattacharya and others previously said that they were mistakes and would be reversed soon.",
      "Weeks have passed since those assurances were made to the scientists. Multiple sources said the scientists have yet to receive any letters revoking their \"reduction in force\" or \"RIF\" notices, or an explanation for why moves to reverse their layoffs never occurred.",
      "That is unlike similar layoffs that were revoked weeks ago at the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the department, which officials completed in the days ahead of Kennedy's testimony to Capitol Hill.",
      "When asked about the employment status of NIH and NIOSH scientists who received reduction in forces notices, a spokesperson for the department pointed back to Kennedy's remarks at the Senate hearing about the layoffs.",
      "Kennedy's claim that no working scientists were fired has drawn disdain in recent days from other laid-off scientists at multiple health agencies beyond the NIH.",
      "For example, while some of the laid-off employees at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health were restored ahead of Kennedy's hearing, researchers in the agency's Health Effects Laboratory Division remain off the job. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also lost many scientists in its National Center for Environmental Health, which had been responsible for an array of work ranging from lead poisonings to illness outbreaks on cruise ships. CDC labs investigating outbreaks of viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases were also eliminated, after all the scientists were laid off.",
      "\"Perhaps he is unaware that his RIFs have gutted scientists and front-line public health workers at CDC, the very people he vowed to protect,\" one laid-off CDC official told CBS News.",
      "Some within the NIH said they believed that the scientists would be reinstated after the research agency faced a second round of layoffs, which employees had been told were to compensate for scientists that needed to be reinstated to their positions.",
      "Around 200 employees at the NIH were laid off, including staff at the National Cancer Institute and Office of Research Facilities. Officials said the cuts wiped out multiple teams responsible for contracting work to conduct emergency maintenance around the NIH's campuses and oversee laboratory safety.",
      "The NIH's acquisitions office was also gutted by those layoffs, according to an email to lab managers shared with CBS News, leaving the agency's supply center with \"little to no capacity for new work\" to obtain supplies for researchers.",

      "\"Guys, I just got the biggest package from them,\" Harrison tells her 3.8 million followers, adding that she's new to the brand's \"family.\" \"I know Drunk Elephant is known for mixing, doing little potion vibes.\"",
      "Those \"potions\" are so-called \"skincare smoothies,\" popular on social media and marketed by the brand, which suggests trios of products to mix together as part of a skincare regimen. They've become a blueprint for some of Generation Alpha's favorite \"get ready with me\" videos as skincare products and adult influencers who promote them have become increasingly trendy among tweens.",
      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

      "Every child born in the U.S. between Jan. 1, 2025 and Jan. 1, 2029 with a Social Security number, and whose parents have Social Security numbers, would be automatically enrolled in the program. The U.S. Treasury would set up and fund the accounts.",
      "Madeline Brown, senior policy associate at the Urban Institute, said automatic enrollment is a key component of the proposed pilot program, given some adults' unfamiliarity with such investment vehicles. Some of the lowest-income families, who could most benefit from the boost, \"often don't know about these kinds of programs. There's a huge awareness gap,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Automatic enrollment is fundamental to improving the likelihood that it reaches the lowest-income families,\" she added.",
      "What would be in a \"Trump account\"?",
      "The government would contribute $1,000 to every eligible child's account, which would be invested in the stock market on their behalf. Families and third parties could also contribute up to $5,000 a year to a child's account.",
      "Sam Taube, investment expert at personal finance site Nerdwallet, said the proposed \"Trump accounts\" are similar to programs currently offered by a number of states, but the contributions aren't as generous. For instance Colorado's First Step program awards every newborn $100 in a 529 college savings account, plus a match of $500 a year for the first five years of savings, totaling up to $2,500 in gift contributions.",
      "What could the money be spent on?",
      "Accountholders would only be approved to be spend investment funds on prescribed costs, such as a down payment on a home, education-related expenses, or starting a small business. Use of the funds to pay for unapproved expenses would subject accountholders to penalties.",
      "But broadening the scope of approved expenditures would be even more beneficial to many families, Brown noted.",
      "\"When it comes to wealth building, we have to make sure the target sums that kids end up with at 18 are in line with the things we're saying you can use the money for,\" Brown explained.",
      "If lower-income accountholders' families can't contribute the additional $5,000 per year, the sum they would end up with as adults might not cover a down payment, for example.",
      "\"There are lots of different projections around what $1,000 can grow to with different interest rates, but it's not a down payment,\" she said. \"So unless additional contributions come from the community, the federal government or state governments, we're not likely to see these accounts grow to the sums that we're saying are qualified uses.",
      "When could the funds be withdrawn?",
      "Half of the funds could be withdrawn when a child turns 18, at which point the account's gains would be taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate, so long as the money were spent as directed. If the funds were used for other purposes, withdrawals would be taxed as income. A 10% penalty for misspending the money could also apply. Accountholders would have access to their full balances between the ages of 25-30 for approved purposes, and after 30, would be able to withdraw the funds for any purpose.",
      "Brown said she thinks improvements could be made to the way the program is structured, particularly around how account withdrawals are taxed. She noted that the lowest-income families would be the most likely to spend the funds on unapproved expenses, and face tax penalties.",
      "Most Americans can't afford a $1,000 emergency expense, according to a January report from Bankrate, making low-earners more likely to need to tap into the funds for surprise costs.",
      "\"They are the most likely to have to withdraw dollars for nonqualified expenses, and in doing so, they [would] receive a tax penalty. So there are ways to exempt emergency expenses, and that would be a fix,\" Brown said.",
      "Otherwise, she said, the upsides to the accounts are limited. \"There are other places you can save money where you won't have that tax penalty if you withdraw the funds early,\" Brown said.",
      "Taube of Nerdwallet noted that the proposed accounts' tax benefits are also questionable.",
      "\"Although they are advertised as tax-advantaged accounts, the way they work does not seem to be that different from how a taxable brokerage account would work,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That said, \"given the state of saving for children's future expenses in this country, the accounts do seem like they could help at least somewhat,\" Taube said.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 15:37:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation that passed in the lower chamber early Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda in order to win over opposing factions in the GOP. And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

    "summary": "The largest buyers of $TRUMP will be rewarded with a private dinner with President Trump at his golf course in Virginia.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump's new tariffs started throttling freight traffic, the leader of trucking logistics firm Freight Technologies used an unorthodox method to try and get the president's attention.",
      "The California-based firm purchased $2 million worth of Trump Coin, the signature cryptocurrency backed by Mr. Trump. The president and his family launched Trump Coin days before he took office in January. Anyone can buy the cryptocurrency. An analytics firm says Mr. Trump's family and other backers have collected more than $300 million in transaction fees so far.",
      "Donald Quinby, Freight Technologies' chief financial officer, told CBS News that the purchase seemed like \"really the best platform for us to make a splash, to make some noise.\"",
      "\"With the Trump meme token, this was just an opportunity to really advocate for free and fair trade,\" Quinby said. \"I'm sure he likes to follow who's purchasing his coins.\"",
      "In April, the Trump family announced an \"intimate private dinner\" with the president at Mr. Trump's golf course in Virginia to reward the biggest buyers of Trump Coin, or $TRUMP. A leaderboard was created so buyers could compete with one another. Buyers eventually spent $140 million trying to secure access to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Some of the 220 leading buyers of $TRUMP received tickets to attend the dinner. Mr. Trump will also host a smaller reception for the token's top 25 holders. The guests are beneficiaries of a new opportunity to gain access and potential influence in a city with a long history of blending money and politics, experts said.",
      "\"This is really unprecedented,\" said Jessica Tillipman, a George Washington University law professor. \"This appears to be a president that could be potentially benefiting privately from something that he's doing out in the open.\"",
      "The White House pushed back hard on the notion that the gala dinner or the president's role in promoting the cryptocurrency crossed any ethical lines. Administration officials said they had not approved an initial plan suggesting top buyers of the meme coin product would receive a White House tour.",
      "\"This is a personal dinner that the president is attending on his personal time,\" a White House official told CBS News in a statement. \"The White House has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",
      "Trump rewards cryptocurrency buyers",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. They are not usually used in transactions, and are known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025, but soared in value after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced.",
      "Among the attendees of Thursday's dinner is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire and the largest holder of Trump Coin. Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes, and is best known for creating the Tron blockchain. He was also the buyer who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan. Sun promptly ate the fruit.",
      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Thursday. \"The GENIUS Act will supercharge Donald Trump's ability to collect money from anybody who is seeking pardon, who wants tariff relief, who wants a criminal prosecution dropped.\"",
      "The White House has dismissed criticisms that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest.",
      "\"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children, and I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Quinby found that buying the meme coin didn't immediately result in access to the president. Freight Technologies didn't make it to the leaderboard, but they are prepared to keep spending. The trucking company reported in public securities filings that their investment in $TRUMP could eventually reach $20 million, if that's what it takes to get Mr. Trump's attention. Even if they lose money on the market, Quinby thinks it was worth the risk.",
      "\"We thought the ability for us to get out there and advocate for the fair and free trade, we thought it was worth it,\" Quinby said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salt-deduction-cap-trump-big-beautiful-bill-tax-40000-cbs-news-explains/",

    "summary": "The budget bill passed by the House includes a provision to quadruple the state and local tax deduction, a boon for some homeowners.",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. homeowners may soon get a sizable tax break thanks to the massive budget package that was passed by the House early Thursday.",
      "The legislation \u2014 dubbed the \u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 includes a provision that would lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000 from its current $10,000 limit. That could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or who earn enough to have significant state income tax liabilities.",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced by Mr. Trump in his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to offset that legislation's tax breaks, such as its reduction in individual income tax rates. Prior to that law, there was no limit on how much in state and local taxes taxpayers could deduct from their federal income taxes.",
      "The unlimited SALT deduction had been criticized by some policy experts as mainly benefiting upper-income\u00a0homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But with real estate values surging in recent years, more homeowners around the U.S. are now getting socked with higher property taxes and bumping against the SALT deduction limit, prompting some lawmakers to call for changes to the $10,000 cap.",
      "The SALT deduction limit \"really eliminated a fairly significant deduction for most taxpayers in Massachusetts, especially given how high property taxes can be here,\" Boston tax attorney Dan Ryan told CBS News Boston.",
      "The backers of the new bill \"needed to keep Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California happy,\" which led to the negotiation for a higher SALT limit, he added.",
      "To be sure, the tax and spending bill could undergo more changes before it reaches President Trump's desk. The measure must now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already expressed opposition to certain aspects of the bill, such as Medicaid spending cuts.",
      "What is the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, and capped the deduction at $10,000 for both single and married couples. The provision covers state income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes.",
      "In 2017, the Treasury Department estimated that almost 11 million taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey would forfeit\u00a0$323 billion in deductions\u00a0because of the new cap.",
      "Some lawmakers criticized the deduction limit for its marriage penalty, given that married couples are subject to the same SALT deduction threshold as single filers. Typically, tax provisions are more generous for married couples because they are designed to cover two individuals. For instance, the standard deduction for married couples is $30,000 in 2025, double the $15,000 standard deduction for single filers.",
      "What's changing with the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The House tax bill lifts the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, with the new threshold scheduled to take effect for the current 2025 tax year. An earlier version of the bill had proposed a $30,000 deduction limit, but some lawmakers pushed for a higher threshold to help more homeowners.",
      "The change was hailed by Republicans from high-tax congressional districts. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said in a social media post that the increased SALT limit would ease \"the tax burden for middle-class and working families.\"",
      "\"This includes annual increases for inflation and income caps to ensure this is not a handout for the uber wealthy,\" Lawler added.",
      "The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. Those who earn above that amount would face a phaseout, although the deduction wouldn't go lower than $10,000. Both the cap and the income limit would increase 1% per year over the next decade, according to a May 22 analysis from law firm Kutak Rock.",
      "Who could benefit from the higher SALT cap?",
      "People whose deductible expenses \u2014 including property taxes, state income taxes and mortgage interest \u2014 exceed their standard deduction could benefit from the higher SALT cap.",
      "For instance, a married couple would need those costs to surpass their 2025 standard deduction of $30,000 to take advantage of the higher SALT cap. That's because taxpayers typically claim whatever is higher \u2014 the standard deduction or their total itemized deductions \u2014 to maximize the amount they can tap to lower their federal tax liability.",
      "\"It will benefit homeowners, especially people who live in wealthier towns with higher property taxes, and higher income taxpayers,\" Ryan, the tax attorney, told CBS News Boston.",
      "High-income homeowners would be the most likely to qualify for the new deduction, with more than half of the benefit going to taxpayers making at least $400,000, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "How much would raising the SALT cap cost the U.S.?",
      "If adopted, lifting the SALT cap would result in the federal government forgoing more tax revenue, policy experts say.",
      "The $40,000 limit would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade, when compared with keeping the $10,000 cap in place, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania nonpartisan group that analyzes the fiscal impact of policy.",
      "That adds to the cost of a bill that has been criticized by some experts\u00a0and lawmakers as introducing new tax breaks that could outstrip any savings in the legislation and trillions to the U.S. debt.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model \"has projected that America will face certain risk of a fiscal crisis within the next two decades, eroding household purchasing power, unless action is taken to reduce federal deficits,\" Kent Smetters, head of the group, said in a email after the House passed the budget package.",

    "story": [
      "The Treasury Department said it plans to stop manufacturing the penny, calling time on one of the first coins minted by the U.S. government.",
      "The federal agency placed its final order for penny blanks this month, with the United States Mint slated to end manufacturing of the penny when that runs out, a Treasury official told CBS MoneyWatch. The blanks \u2014 flat, metal discs that the Mint turns into coins \u2014 will run out in early 2026, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.",
      "The penny, which dates from the early days of the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. The 1-cent coin cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "Ending production of the penny will save the Mint about $56 million in annual savings, the Treasury said on Thursday.",
      "Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "The Trump administration had recently signaled it was out to stop making the 1-cent coin, with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency saying in January that the penny was too costly\u00a0to produce. In February, President Trump said he had directed the Treasury to stop minting new pennies, citing the rising production costs.",
      "\"For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!\" Mr. Trump wrote in a February post on his Truth Social site. \"I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\"",
      "Previous presidential administrations have also scrutinized the penny due to the rising cost of production, with former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew\u00a0pushing the idea\u00a0in 2015.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 10:11:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Seniors are unlikely to get a break on paying taxes on their Social Security benefits, an issue that impacts more people each year.",
    "story": [
      "Republican-backed legislation approved Thursday morning by House lawmakers includes a number of\u00a0tax breaks promised by President Trump during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay. One tax break that isn't in the bill: Mr. Trump's\u00a0suggestion\u00a0last year that seniors shouldn't have to pay income taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "\"Seniors should not pay taxes on Social Security and they won't,\" Mr. Trump said\u00a0while during an August campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.",
      "A provision to eliminate taxes on Social Security isn't included in President Trump's domestic policy bill that passed early Thursday following a dramatic all-night session.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition. The proposed legislation, which spans more than 1,000 pages and includes a 42-page amendment with last-minute changes, would make Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other temporary reductions.",
      "The reason for the Social Security exclusion boils down to a prohibition on making changes to the retirement program through the so-called reconciliation process, a legislative procedure Republicans are relying on to pass the bill, said Maria Freese, the senior legislative representative at the The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. That process represents a fast-track option that obviates the 60-vote threshold typically required to advance a bill in the Senate, she said.",
      "Trying to change the Social Security program through reconciliation would have violated what is known as the\u00a0Byrd rule, a rule (named after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what can be included in reconciliation bills, she explained.",
      "\"Enhanced deduction for seniors\"",
      "Instead of eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, the House bill includes a new tax break for senior citizens: an extra $4,000 deduction for filers who are 65 and older.",
      "Called an \"enhanced deduction for seniors,\" it would be available to people who both itemize and those who take the standard deduction. That could help lower taxes for the roughly 56 million people in the U.S. who are 65 or older.",
      "But the new deduction for seniors is a limited-time break: It would be effective starting in the current 2025 tax year, but expire starting in the 2029 tax year, according to the legislation.",
      "The tax break also has an income threshold, with the full $4,000 deduction available to single filers who earn $75,000 or less and for married couples with annual incomes below $150,000. The deduction would be phased out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Currently, about 40% of Social Security recipients \u2014 or about 27 million people \u2014 pay federal income taxes on their benefits, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"I'm sure there are a lot of seniors who would be quite disappointed they will continue to pay taxes\" on their benefits, Freese said.",
      "Social Security's fiscal outlook",
      "Social Security benefits were excluded from income taxes until 1984, when changes signed into law by President Ronald Reagan introduced taxes on Social Security income above a certain threshold.",
      "Because that threshold wasn't indexed to inflation, the number of older Americans who are required to pay income taxes on their benefits has steadily risen. The share of seniors who pay taxes on their benefits is now 40%, up from was 26% in 1998,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Those taxes directly support the Social Security and Medicare programs, providing about $50 billion in annual revenue,\u00a0according to the latest\u00a0annual report\u00a0from Social Security's board of trustees.",
      "Meanwhile, eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would hurt the long-term outlook of both the retirement program and of Medicare, the health insurance program for people 65 and older, according the Peter G. Peterson Institute, a think tank focusing on fiscal policy.",
      "Without that source of revenue, the trust fund for Social Security would be depleted in 2032, one year earlier than currently projected, while Medicare's trust fund would be depleted in 2030, six years earlier than forecast now, the group added.",
      "The result would be \"automatic cuts for millions of beneficiaries,\" the institute noted.",
      "Scrapping taxes on Social Security might sound appealing to many senior citizens in the near-term, but over the long term that would weaken the stability of the program, Freese said.",
      "\"We viewed it as a bait and switch,\" she said. \"You give some seniors a benefit upfront, but don't tell them that all seniors would run the risk of across-the-board cuts sooner than they would under current law.\"",

      "\"If I have you incarcerated on Rikers, I have to pay for [the] facility, the officers, the food,\" she said. \"Whereas, when I take a person and give them opportunity, they pay taxes. So now, we as a society are getting taxpayer revenue from a person that is not in a box on a shelf.\"",

    "summary": "Federal judge strikes down government regulations requiring most U.S. employers to accommodate workers for abortions.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which passed in December 2022.",
      "The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers.",
      "Joseph, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses.",
      "Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, \"It would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time.\"",
      "Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of a rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana.",
      "Bipartisan support for pregnant workers law",
      "The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women's right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job.",
      "The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees.",
      "While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs.",
      "But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it.",
      "Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a \"related medical condition\" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand.",
      "\"Victory! A federal court has granted Louisiana's request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees' purely elective abortions. This is a win for Louisiana and for life!\" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press.",
      "A Better Balance, the advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling.",
      "\"This court's decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,\" A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement.",
      "EEOC adrift",
      "Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations.",
      "President Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws.",
      "For now, Mr. Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. The president tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum.",
      "Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who voted against the regulations because of the abortion provision, has said she will work to change them.",
      "Similar lawsuits challenging the abortion provision are underway, including one filed by 17 states, led by Tennessee and Arkansas. In February, an appeals court ruled that lawsuit could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department had defended the EEOC against those lawsuits but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so under the Trump administration. The Justice Department did not reply to request for comment on Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Chettiar said the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the ruling, adding to its significance.",
      "\"The impact of this is huge,\" Chettiar said in an interview with The Associated Press, calling the decision \"symbolic and a big signal of where the right is when it comes to the rights of women.\"",
      "However, the Trump administration has continued defend the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act itself in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas that seeks to overturn the law in its entirety.",

      "Stocks are slumping amid signs of slowing consumer spending and investor concerns about the U.S. fiscal outlook.",
      "Target, one of the nation's largest retailers, on Wednesday reported weaker sales for the first quarter and warned of a potential downdraft over the rest of the year as Americans react to U.S. tariffs by pulling back on consumption.",
      "The company's sales fell 2.8% to $23.8 billion in the January-March period, down from $24.5 billion from the year-ago quarter, while Target said it expects a low-single digit decline in sales for 2025.",
      "Target \"faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence [and] uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs,\" CEO Brian Cornell said in a call with Wall Street analysts.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 96 points, or 1.5%, to close at 5,845. The Dow Jones Industrial Complex dropped 817 points, or 1.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.4%.",
      "Target shares fell $5.11 on the day, or 5.2% to $93.01.",
      "Such weakness comes as more companies say that rising economic uncertainty is clouding their financial prospects. Other large retailers, including Walmart, have said they plan to hike prices to offset tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on China and other countries.",
      "\"We continue to feel there's too much complacency about two key (and related) sources of macro risk: tariffs and fiscal policy,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a note to investors. \"Despite a de-escalation of trade tensions, tariffs are still quite elevated on an absolute basis, and the full effects of these import taxes haven't been felt yet in the economy.\"",
      "Shrinking corporate sales and profits could eventually shackle job growth, which has remained resilient in recent months, experts note.",
      "\"Businesses expect growth in consumer demand to slow and view the outlook as unusually uncertain, so they are pausing hiring,\" analysts with Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a research note.",
      "Some retailers are benefiting from the current environment as some consumers tighten their belts. Discount giant TJX Companies, whose brands include HomeGoods, Marshall's and TJ Maxx, on Wednesday reported a 5% rise in net sales for its fiscal 2026 first quarter from a year ago.",
      "Tax bill overhang",
      "Investors are also assessing how a Republican-backed tax and spending bill\u00a0now being negotiated in the House could impact the nation's finances. Moody's on Friday highlighted the government's growing debt pile in its decision to\u00a0downgrade the U.S. credit rating. A weaker credit rating raises borrowing costs for the U.S.",
      "\"We do not think that the downgrade matters by itself,\" Bank of America strategists wrote in a report, \"but it has served as a wake up call for those investors who had been ignoring the ongoing fiscal discussion.\"",
      "Stocks were also feeling pressure from higher Treasury yields in the bond market, which can weigh on other types of investments. Bond prices have dipped because of concerns that a move in Congress to extend tax cuts could add trillions to the federal debt.",
      "\"The bulk of the bill simply extends existing [tax] rates rather than lowering them incrementally,\" Crisafulli said. \"In addition, there are some offsets that could financially harm lower-income Americans. Most important, the legislation is massively expensive and will add further to the debt/deficit at a time when both are already extremely unbalanced.\"",

    "summary": "Google is making more upgrades to its search engine with the addition of the AI Mode feature.",
    "story": [
      "Google on Tuesday rolled out AI Mode, its latest artificial intelligence feature designed to provide users with more detailed and tailored responses to questions entered into the search engine.",
      "Unveiled Tuesday at the search giant's annual Google I/O developer conference, AI Mode comes a year after the company introduced AI Overviews, its first tool to use generative AI technology to enhance its search engine capabilities.",
      "Sundar Pichai, CEO of both Google and parent company,Alphabet,\u00a0said in remarks at the conference that AI Mode represents a \"total reimagining of Search\" and that it would gradually be rolled out to all Google users.",
      "\"What all this progress means is that we are in a new phase of the AI platform shift, where decades of research are now becoming reality for people all over the world,\" Pichai told the crowd yesterday at an amphitheater near the company's \u00a0headquarters in Mountain View, California, according to the Associated Press.",
      "A\u00a0video teasing the technology showcases how it works. In response to lengthy, detailed questions typed into Google search, AI Mode displays how many searches Google is performing and how many sites it's scanning as the technology quickly generates a summarized response at the top of the search platform. It also provides a side bar with links to relevant sites.",
      "Google said it's also testing a \"Search Live\" feature that will enable the search engine to respond to questions based on video content, as well as voice searches, or to questions verbalized by the user, rather than typed.",
      "As an example, Google's\u00a0teaser\u00a0shows a person recording a video of themselves holding a bridge made of Popsicle sticks while asking the search engine what can be done to strengthen the structure. \"To make it stronger, consider adding more triangles to the design,\" an automated voice responds.",
      "Google said it will begin feeding its latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, into its search engine starting next week. The company calls Gemini 2.5 its \"most intelligent model\" yet.",
      "Rapid advancements",
      "The California-based company began testing AI Mode in March of this year. Google's latest AI search tool builds on AI Overviews, which was introduced in the U.S. in May 2024 and has 1.5 billion users, according to an article on the\u00a0Google\u00a0website.",
      "Some argue that AI Overviews, which provides an AI-generated summary of information online, at times eliminating the need to click directly on source links for further information, has undercut traffic to their sites. According to a\u00a0study by Ahrefs, AI Overviews led to a 35% lower average click-through rates for top-ranking pages on search engine results pages.",
      "Concerns over accuracy",
      "\"By making AI Mode a core part of the experience, Google is betting it can cater to the demand for AI without alienating its massive base,\" Gadjo Sevilla, a senior analyst for research firm eMarketer, wrote in a blog\u00a0post. \"But there are risks for hallucinations and factual errors which could drive users towards competitors,\" he added.",
      "Such factual errors were spotted with AI Overviews soon after its release, prompting Google to admit in a statement at the time that the technology produced \"some odd and erroneous overviews.\" In one instance, AI Overviews suggested that users add glue to pizza or eat at least one small rock a day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the MIT Technology Review.",
      "As for AI Mode, Google has indicated that its new AI search tech is performing well and serving its intended purpose.",
      "\"We conduct quantitative research and collect in-product feedback to ask users whether they're satisfied with their results. And we've seen that introducing AI Overviews on Search leads to an increase in satisfaction and reported helpfulness,\" a Google spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 May 2025 07:14:07 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Department of Education this month resuming collections on student loans, millions of Americans are at risk of having their wages garnished.",
    "story": [
      "Americans with student loans who are behind on their payments could face having their wages garnished and other serious financial consequences now that the Trump administration restarted collections\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "Repayments on student debt had been paused for five years since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the U.S. economy and caused unemployment to soar. Nearly 43 million borrowers owe a total of more than $1.6 trillion in student debt, according to the Department of Education.",
      "Of that number, more than 5 million are in default on their loans, meaning they haven't made a monthly payment in more than 360 days, the agency says. An additional 4 million borrowers are in late-stage delinquency, having not made a payment in at least 91 days. The DOE expects that 10 million, or 25% of student borrowers, could be in default on their loans in a matter of months.",
      "In the first three months of the year, the delinquency rate for student loans jumped from less than 1% to nearly 8%, according to recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Older Americans are in worse shape when it comes to repaying student debt than younger borrowers. Although Americans over 50 years of age make up just 20% of those with outstanding college loans, they account for 33% of delinquencies, according to Oxford Economics which notes that younger borrowers are in relatively better shape.",
      "Student loans differ from other types of consumer debt in that there is no statute of limitations on collections, meaning the government can pursue punitive actions for defaulted loans indefinitely, noted Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "\"It's so much worse than just about any other financial product,\" Yu told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's a really small universe of things that have these harsh penalties.\"",
      "And because collections were paused for five years due to the pandemic, some student loan borrowers may have forgotten about the severe financial consequences of defaulting. \"It's left the collective consciousness,\" she said.",
      "Here's what to know about the potential repercussions of defaulting on student debt, including when your wages can be garnished.",
      "When can a lender garnish your wages?",
      "The Trump administration announced\u00a0on April 21 that the office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) would resume collections on defaulted federal student loans starting May 5. The DOE said at the time that it would email notices to borrowers in default over the following two weeks to make \"them aware of these developments.\"",
      "Notices from the FSA informing borrowers that their wages could be garnished will come \"later this summer,\" the DOE said.",
      "Under the law, a lender can garnish borrowers' pay without going to court provided it has given them at least 60 days notice, generally by email, before initiating the collection action.",
      "\"All they have to do is send borrowers a notice that they are going to take your money, and you have 60 days to respond,\" Yu said.",
      "Given that collections on student loans resumed earlier this month, people could begin to see their wages garnished in the fall, according to experts.",
      "The government notice informs people how to start making payments, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan or sign up for loan rehabilitation to avoid having a portion of their paychecks seized. It doesn't, however, instruct borrowers how they can stop wage garnishment.",
      "\"The notices the Trump administration is sending out do not lay out defenses and don't lay out the right to appeal wage garnishment on basis of financial hardship, and that's really important for borrowers to understand,\" Yu said.",
      "How much can be withheld from your paycheck?",
      "A lender may garnish up to 15% of your disposable pay, but must leave borrowers with the equivalent of 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage of $7.25, or $217.50 per week. That applies even if a borrower resides in a state where the minimum wage is higher than the federal level.",
      "Can other assets be garnished?",
      "Yes. In addition to wages, the federal government may also seize tax refunds and Social Security retirement and disability benefits when loans are in default.",
      "If you've already filed your taxes and received a refund, it's protected, Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But you'd be on notice if you asked for an extension,\" she explained.",
      "The government or a lender would likely have to take a borrower to court in order to target other assets.",
      "\"That would entail getting a judgment and doing some kind of court intervention, and those are relatively rare,\" Nierman said.",
      "How can you get out of default?",
      "Beyond possibly leading to wage garnishment, defaulting on a student loan hurts in other ways. It damages your credit, which raises borrowing costs or limits access to credit like mortgages and car loans.",
      "In some cases, student loan borrowers have the right to contest their default status. First, the debt might not be their own. Second, they might not owe the amount of debt the government claims they do. Third, they can claim that wage garnishment would cause them financial hardship.",
      "\"There are legitimate reasons why they can stop wage garnishment from occurring,\" Yu said. \"But I am very worried these notices aren't telling people about the full scope of the relief.\"",
      "Borrowers can also get current on their loans through other methods. For example, consider requesting loan rehabilitation to get out of default by making nine on-time payments in full over a 10-month period.",
      "You can also avoid entering default and having wages garnished through loan consolidation. Essentially, this process replaces your old debt with a new loan that's in good standing and on which you can start making payments. If you're able to repay your loans in full, that's another way to exit default.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 May 2025 20:19:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Late last year, South Carolina Medicaid approved GLP-1s to treat obesity, placing it among the few state programs covering the drugs. But access remains limited.",
    "story": [
      "CHARLESTON, S.C. \u2014 When Page Campbell's doctor recommended that she try an injectable prescription drug called Wegovy to lose weight before scheduling bariatric surgery, she readily agreed.",
      "\"I've struggled with my weight for so long,\" said Campbell, 40, a single mother of two. \"I'm not opposed to trying anything.\"",
      "In early April, about four weeks after she'd started taking Wegovy, Campbell said she hadn't experienced any side effects, such as nausea or bowel irritation. But she doesn't use a scale at home, so she said she didn't know whether she'd lost any weight since her most recent medical appointment earlier this year, when she weighed 314 pounds. Still, she was confident about achieving weight loss.",
      "\"It's going to work because I'm putting in the work. I'm changing my eating habits. I'm exercising,\" said Campbell, a shipping manager at a Michaels store. \"I'm not going to second-guess myself.\"",
      "Wegovy belongs to a pricey class of drugs called GLP-1s (short for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists) that have upended the treatment of obesity in recent years, offering hope to patients who have tried and failed to lose weight in myriad other ways.",
      "Campbell gained access to Wegovy through South Carolina Medicaid's decision in late 2024 to cover these weight loss drugs. But the medications remain out of reach for millions of patients across the country who could benefit from them, because many public and private health insurers have deemed the drugs too expensive.",
      "A report published in November by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, found only 13 states were covering GLP-1s for the treatment of obesity for Medicaid beneficiaries as of August 2024. South Carolina became the 14th in November.",
      "Liz Williams, one of the report's authors and a senior policy manager for the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, said she was not aware of any other state Medicaid programs joining the list since then. Looking ahead, the remaining states may be reluctant to add a new, expensive drug benefit while they brace for potential federal cuts coming from Congress, she said.",
      "\"As the budget debate, federally, is developing, that may impact how states are thinking about this,\" Williams said.",
      "The federal government won't be helping anytime soon, either. Medicare covers GLP-1s to treat diabetes and some other health conditions, including obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, but not obesity. In early April, the Trump administration announced it will not finalize a rule proposed by the Biden administration that would have allowed an estimated 7.4 million people covered by Medicare and Medicaid to access GLP-1s for weight loss. Meanwhile, the Food and Drug Administration is poised to force less expensive, compounded versions of these drugs off the market.",
      "And the barrier to entry remains high, even for Medicaid patients in those few states that have agreed to cover the drugs without a federal mandate.",
      "Case in point: In South Carolina, where more than one-third of all adults, and nearly half of the African American population, qualify as obese, the state Medicaid agency estimates only 1,300 beneficiaries will meet the stringent prerequisites for GLP-1 coverage.",
      "Under one of those requirements, Medicaid beneficiaries who wish to access these drugs to lose weight must attest to \"increased exercise activity,\" said Jeff Leieritz, a spokesperson for the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Campbell, who is insured by Medicaid, was granted coverage for Wegovy based on her body mass index. First, though, she was required to submit six months' worth of documentation proving that she'd tried and failed to lose weight after receiving nutrition counseling and going on a 1,200-calorie-a day diet, said Kenneth Mitchell, one of Campbell's doctors and the medical director for bariatric surgery and obesity medicine at Roper St. Francis Healthcare.",
      "Campbell's Wegovy prescription was approved for six months, Mitchell said. When that authorization expires, Campbell and her health care team will need to submit more documentation, including proof that she has lost at least 5% of her body weight and has kept up with nutrition counseling.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Send a prescription in and they cover it.' It's rather arduous,\" Mitchell said. \"Not a lot of folks are going to do this.\"",
      "Mitchell said South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover these drugs was met with excitement among those working in his medical specialty. But he wasn't surprised that the state anticipates relatively few people will access this benefit annually, since the approval process is so rigorous and the cost high. \"The problem is the medicines are so expensive,\" Mitchell said.",
      "Novo Nordisk, which manufactures Wegovy, announced in March that it was cutting the monthly price for the drug from $650 to $499 for cash-paying customers. The price that health insurance plans and beneficiaries pay for these drugs varies, but some GLP-1s cost more than $1,000 per patient per month, Mitchell said, and many people will need to take them for the rest of their lives to maintain weight loss.",
      "\"That is a tremendous price tag that someone has to foot the bill for,\" Mitchell said.",
      "That's the reason the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees voted last year to end coverage of GLP-1s for state employees, after then-North Carolina Treasurer Dale Folwell's office estimated in 2023 that the drugs were projected to cost the State Health Plan $1 billion over the next six years. The decision came only a few months after a separate North Carolina agency announced it would start covering these drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries. North Carolina Medicaid has estimated it will spend $16 million a year on GLP-1s.",
      "South Carolina Medicaid, which insures fewer than half the number of people enrolled in North Carolina Medicaid, anticipates spending less. Leieritz estimated GLP-1s and nutrition counseling offered to Medicaid beneficiaries in South Carolina will cost $10 million a year. State funding will cover $3.3 million of the expense; the remainder will be paid for by matching Medicaid funds from the federal government.",
      "In a recent interview, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn't rule out the possibility that Medicare and Medicaid might cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment in the future as costs come down.",
      "They're \"extraordinary drugs\" and \"we're going to reduce the cost,\" Kennedy told CBS News in early April. He said he would like GLP-1s to eventually be made available to Medicare and Medicaid patients who are seeking obesity treatment after they have tried other ways to lose weight. \"That is the framework that we're now debating.\"",
      "Meanwhile, public health experts have applauded South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s. Yet the new benefit won't help the vast majority of the 1.5 million adults in South Carolina who are classified as obese, according to data published by the South Carolina Department of Public Health.",
      "\"We still have some work to do,\" acknowledged Brannon Traxler, the public health department's chief medical officer.",
      "But the state's new \"Action Plan for Healthy Eating and Active Living,\" written by a coalition of groups in South Carolina, including the Department of Public Health, makes no mention of GLP-1s or the role they might play in lowering obesity rates in the state.",
      "The action plan, underwritten by a $1.5 million federal grant, isn't meant to lay out an overarching approach for lowering obesity in South Carolina, Traxler said. Instead, it promotes physical activity in schools, nutrition, and the expansion of outdoor walking trails, among other strategies. A more comprehensive obesity plan might address the benefits of surgical intervention and GLP-1s, but those also carry risk, expense, and side effects, Traxler said.",
      "\"Certainly, I think, there is a need to bring it all together,\" she said.",
      "Campbell, for one, is taking the comprehensive approach. On top of injecting Wegovy once weekly, she said, she is prioritizing protein intake and moving her body. She also underwent weight loss surgery in late April.",
      "\"Weight loss is my biggest goal,\" said Campbell, who expressed appreciation for Medicaid's coverage of Wegovy. \"It's one more thing that's going to help me get to my goal.\"",

      "The largest holder of President Trump's cryptocurrency token is entrepreneur Justin Sun, the billionaire revealed Tuesday \u2014 earning him an invite to a controversial dinner this week hosted by Mr. Trump for his meme coin's biggest backers.",
      "Sun announced he will attend Thursday evening's dinner at Mr. Trump's D.C.-area golf club \u2014 which is open to the 220 largest holders of the $TRUMP meme coin \u2014 in a post on X, describing himself as the president's \"TOP fan.\"",
      "\"As the top holder of $TRUMP, I'm excited to connect with everyone, talk crypto, and discuss the future of our industry,\" wrote Sun, who founded the Tron blockchain and faced a securities lawsuit from Biden-era federal regulators.",
      "The meme coin's website lists the largest holder of $TRUMP as somebody with the username \"Sun\" who owns about 1.4 million tokens \u2014 worth around $19 million at Tuesday's trading price.",
      "In addition to the dinner for the top 220 holders of $TRUMP, the president is also hosting an \"Exclusive Reception\" at his club in Northern Virginia for the token's top 25 holders. Sun did not immediately respond when asked by CBS News if he would attend the smaller reception.",
      "What is the $TRUMP meme coin \u2014 and why is it controversial?",
      "The meme coin was launched in January, days before Mr. Trump's inauguration. An affiliate of the Trump organization and a firm called Fight Fight Fight LLC control 80% of the coin's total supply.",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is driven mostly by online buzz, especially on social media. They typically do not have intrinsic value and are not used for transactions. Like many meme coins, $TRUMP is known for erratic price shifts: Its price peaked at around $75 shortly after its launch, but plummeted to under $8 by early April.",
      "But late last month, the price surged after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced. Buyers spent more than $140 million to buy the $TRUMP coins in hopes of securing an invitation to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Mr. Trump previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" The president and his two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are backing the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and crypto makes up some $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth according to a recent report.",
      "Eric Trump in January called the $TRUMP coin \"the hottest digital meme on earth.\"",
      "The $TRUMP private dinner marketing promotion \u2014 and the president's links to World Liberty \u2014 have raised concerns among government watchdogs and Democratic lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest.",
      "The Senate on Monday advanced a bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, that would regulate so-called stablecoins \u2014 a type of cryptocurrency linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. The bill faced some pushback from Democrats who pushed for anti-corruption rules, often citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings.",
      "\"How convenient: the day after the Senate advances the GENIUS Act, Justin Sun \u2014 a major investor in the Trump family crypto venture \u2014 announces he's getting a private dinner as the President's top crypto buyer,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement.",
      "The White House has dismissed criticism that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest, noting his assets are held in a trust managed by his children.",
      "\"The President is working to secure GOOD deals for the American people, not for himself. President Trump only acts in the best interests of the American public \u2013 which is why they overwhelmingly re-elected him to this office, despite years of lies and false accusations against him and his businesses from the fake news media,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Who is Justin Sun?",
      "Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes. He's best known for the Tron blockchain \u2014 and for paying $6.2 million at auction for a banana that artist Maurizio Cattelan duct-taped to a wall, which Sun promptly ate as part of a \"unique artistic experience.\"",
      "Sun says his firm has also invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial.",
      "He was sued by the Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" for a crypto token created by his company. The suit also accused his firm of paying celebrities like Lindsey Lohan and Jake Paul to promote the token \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Sun's attorneys have pushed back on the suit.",
      "But earlier this year, the SEC and Sun agreed to pause the lawsuit to \"explore a potential resolution.\" The halt was part of a broader shift by the Trump administration to ease cryptocurrency enforcement.",

    "summary": "Republican tax bill could cost $3.8 trillion over 10 years as its tax cuts surpass spending reductions, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican-backed tax and spending bill that's now moving forward in the House is getting a reality check from Wall Street. That's because the proposed tax breaks are projected to far outstrip any savings in the bill, potentially leading to mounting U.S. debt and a worsening fiscal outlook, according to economists and policy experts.",
      "If the bill moves forward without significant changes, the U.S. would likely find its debt levels spiraling higher in order to finance the tax cuts, according to several analyses. Over the next decade, the GOP bill could cost the U.S. $3.8 trillion, according to a report\u00a0earlier this month by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined the impact of the the tax measures versus spending cuts.",
      "Those risks are rattling Wall Street. Moody's Ratings on Friday\u00a0downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the new bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit, which excludes interest payments, over the next decade.",
      "The bill also faces detractors within the Republican party, with the House Freedom Caucus saying in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Sunday that the bill \"fails to actually honor our promise to significantly correct the spending trajectory of the federal government and lead our nation towards a balanced budget.\"",
      "The concern, according to both Wall Street economists and policy experts, is that adding billions in debt to the U.S. ledger could eventually squeeze federal spending because the nation would likely face higher interest payments. That, in turn, could make it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security, which is already facing a financial drawdown as baby boomers hit retirement age, or to invest in initiatives like infrastructure that can spur economic growth.",
      "\"It's time for policymakers to hit pause, go back to the drawing board and put forward a plan that actually takes steps toward putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal trajectory,\" said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy think tank, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Our federal interest payments are skyrocketing, already surpassing what we spend annually on defense or Medicare.\"",
      "The Trump administration said it disagreed both with the Moody's analysis and forecasts that the legislation could widen the nation's deficit, which is the gap between federal spending and revenue.",
      "\"This bill does not add to the deficit,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Monday in a press conference. \"In fact, according to the Council of Economic Advisers, there's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill \u2014 that's the largest saving for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "Savings versus spending",
      "At the heart of the proposed GOP bill is President Trump's vow to renew his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which introduced lower tax brackets for many Americans. Because those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, about 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026 without an extension of the law,\u00a0according\u00a0to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation.",
      "The Council of Economic Advisers, a White House agency that advises the president on economic issues,\u00a0said\u00a0in a May study that the new bill would \"avert a $4 trillion tax hike\" by extending the TCJA's provisions.",
      "Renewing the law's cuts alone would cost $2.2 trillion over the next decade, estimates Joint Committee on Taxation, which assesses the impact of policy for Congress. The GOP bill also includes other new tax breaks that would add to the bill's long-term costs, the group's analysis found.",
      "For instance, the bill's proposal to provide taxpayers with a more generous standard deduction would result in $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over the next decade, the Joint Committee found. Eliminating taxes on workers' overtime pay and tips, as well as giving a bigger deduction to senior citizens, would cost an additional $234 billion over the same period, its analysis finds.",
      "The bill does include spending cuts, but they aren't large enough to offset the tax breaks, several recent analyses conclude. The nonpartisan Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0estimated\u00a0in a May 14 analysis that the tax cuts would cost $7.7 trillion over the next decade, while the spending cuts would offset $3.9 trillion over the same period. The result is a gap of $3.8 trillion, it said.",
      "That's the arithmetic that prompted Moody's to cut its rating on U.S. debt, from its top rating of Aaa to Aa1. In its assessment, the credit rating agency noted that the U.S. deficit has spiraled higher as previous administrations and Congress have \"failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend.\"",
      "\"Over the next decade, we expect larger deficits as entitlement spending rises while government revenue remains broadly flat,\" Moody's said on Friday when it became the third major rating agency to cut the nation's credit rating. \"In turn, persistent, large fiscal deficits will drive the government's debt and interest burden higher.\"",
      "It added, \"The U.S.' fiscal performance is likely to deteriorate relative to its own past and compared to other highly rated sovereigns.\"",
      "The Trump administration says that the proposed tax bill will spur economic growth by lowering taxes on consumers and businesses. In an interview on Monday with Fox Business, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said the economy is \"going to continue to take off once those policies are actually in place, once we actually have the tax cuts passed.\"",
      "Who wins and loses",
      "The GOP tax bill remains in flux and is likely to change as it winds through the House.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged there are still details to \"iron out\" as conservative Republicans seek to quickly enact work requirements for able-bodied participants in Medicaid. Those rules would take effect in 2029 under the bill passed last week by the Ways and Means Committee. Some House Republicans also want to more quickly end tax breaks for green energy projects being used nationwide.",

    "story": [
      "\"Sneakerheads\" continue to line up for Nike's Air Jordans, the most successful basketball shoe in history. The first Air Jordan shoe \u2013 the iconic black and red with a Nike swoosh \u2013 was released to the public 40 years ago for $65.",
      "The shoe revolutionized the sneaker industry, but it almost didn't happen.",
      "Michael Jordan's game-changing sneaker",
      "Howard White, a Nike veteran and founding father of the Jordan Brand now serving as its senior vice president, was in the room in 1984 with untested NBA rookie Michael Jordan to meet with Nike at its headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. Jordan was practically dragged into the meeting by his parents, Deloris and James Jordan.",
      "The stakes were high for Nike, then a relatively small sneaker company.",
      "\"This was bigger than anything that we'd done. You know, typically a great player would get like a hundred thousand dollars. But this was so unique in terms of just doing it, I mean, just having the guts to make something like this happen,\" White explained to \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" while wearing Christian Dior Jordans, which retail up to $17,000 dollars.",
      "The offer: $2.5 million for Jordan to wear their shoes. That was triple what anyone else in the league was making at the time.",
      "Jordan ended up taking the deal \u2013 and the rest is sneaker history. He went on to lead the Chicago Bulls to six championships, while sporting his shoe brand.",
      "Nike hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years. Instead, they sold $126 million in year one.",
      "Much of that success is thanks to Jordan's ability to seemingly defy gravity with his \"hang time,\" soaring across the paint for legendary dunks. He solidified his nickname \"Air Jordan\" when he\u00a0got a perfect score with his free throw line dunk in the 1987 NBA All-Star Slam Dunk Contest.",
      "Jordan still \"very integral to the operation\"",
      "Nike's marketing approach for the Air Jordan was groundbreaking, joining the cultural conversation in ways few ads had before.",
      "\"In order to translate what he did as a man into what we do as a brand, you have to start with the series of principles we call them ethos,\" Jason Mayden, chief design officer for the Jordan Brand, told \"CBS Sunday Morning.\"",
      "\"So you first start with connectivity, why this product has relevance and reverence. Then you put that into a very strict process that we call visionary. And so what's interesting is we have a playbook. I can't show you what's in it but you can see by the outside,\" he joked.",
      "The Jordan Brand, a standalone division within Nike, generates some $7 billion for Nike annually. They've released a new design every year for the past four decades. Next up: the top secret \"Jordan 40.\"",
      "Forty years later, Mayden says Jordan is still involved with the Air Jordan brand.",
      "\"He's very integral to the operation. He sees everything. He trusts us a lot. He has opinions on things that are near and dear to him,\" he said.",
      "Bigger than basketball",
      "Sean Williams runs the SOLEcial Studies CommUNITY Academy, a Brooklyn-based program dedicated to studying, promoting and collecting shoes \u2013 some 40,000 pairs, he says, since the first Air Jordans came out. He says it has given him his life's purpose.",
      "\"Sneakers are wearable art. So if you take the artistic approach to interpreting a story through certain features on the shoes, certain colorways going behind the design often, and talking to the people who actually design and make these shoes, you're giving the sneakers a level of depth in AKA storytelling that convinces them, that they're making the right purchase when they buy these secrets,\" Williams explained.",
      "For the Jordan Brand, Air Jordans are bigger than basketball. It's about empowering people to believe more in themselves.",
      "White, who still talks to Jordan, says he often reminds the basketball legend that Air Jordan's success is because it's not actually the story of a shoe.",
      "\"If this simple article of footwear can make people interpret themselves in a way that gives them just the power to believe more in themselves. That's what the Jordan brand is about,\" he said.",

      "These horse-drawn funerals were suspended by the Army in May 2023 following the deaths of two of the horses within a 96-hour period back in February 2022, prompting an Army investigation.",
      "As CBS News previously reported, other horses pulling the caissons were also suffering painful muscle and tendon injuries. At the time, the Army said that 27 Arlington horses were\u00a0sent to multiple rehabilitation facilities, and the horses were replaced with hearses.",
      "The horses were performing up to eight funerals a day, in all weather, and pulling wagons that weighed more than a ton.",
      "Most of those horses are retired now, replaced by dozens of new ones.",
      "But Army commanders knew they needed professional help to bring the caissons back. So, they called in equestrian David O'Connor, an Olympic gold medalist with the U.S. Equestrian Federation.",
      "\"The commanding general gets up there and he goes, 'OK, I would like for all of you guys to realize that we do not know what we're talking about,'\" O'Connor recounted to CBS News. \"I thought it was the greatest opening line I've ever heard. That humility was surprising to me: 'We're in serious trouble. We need to really look at this whole thing.'\"",
      "According to Lt. Col. Jason Crawford, a veterinarian and the new commander of the Caisson Detachment, much of the issue centered around education.",
      "\"Once we brought the right experts in, I think everyone then starts having the aha moment,\" Crawford said. \"Like, we didn't know the horses were kind of working too much.\"",
      "Starting in June, two squads of 11 horses will perform two services a day for a total of about 10 funerals per week. Before the pause, some of the horses were working 45 days straight when they were supposed to get two weeks rest after 14 days of work.",
      "And it isn't just the welfare of the animals that is a focus, but the equipment. The old caisson weighed about 2,600 pounds. The new one is more than 1,000 pounds lighter.",
      "There has also been extensive training for unit personnel. Staff Sgt. Isaac Melton, a squad leader, told CBS News he didn't grow up riding horses, and says the first time he even came in contact with one was when he began training 15 months ago. He says that training has averaged about \"eight to 10 hours a day.\"",
      "Melton says \"perfection\" will be going through his mind on day one of the program's return.",
      "Sgt. Daimien Copeland was part of the program before it was suspended.",
      "\"Something inside your chest, let's you just feel \u2014 you're proud, you're nervous, you're excited,\" Copeland said of his feelings of resuming horse-drawn caissons. \"You know, you're honored to be able to be the one that's saying, 'I'm helping bring this back to the cemetery to those service members and their families.'\"",

      "Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink is considering a run for Congress in her home state of Michigan, CBS News has learned.",
      "Brink, who served for 28 years as a diplomat, is mulling a bid in Michigan's 7th congressional district, which is currently represented by Republican Tom Barrett. The Lansing-area district is rated by the Cook Political Report as a tossup, and was represented by Democrat Elissa Slotkin until earlier this year, when she moved to the Senate.",
      "In a statement first given to the Detroit News, Brink said, \"I've dedicated my life to public service \u2014 working under five Presidents, both Democratic and Republican, and am exploring my options and the best way to continue to serve my country and my great home state of Michigan.\"",
      "Brink resigned her post as envoy to Ukraine in April. In an op-ed last week in the Detroit Free Press, she said policy differences with the Trump administration prompted her to step down. President Trump has pressed Ukraine and Russia to strike a peace deal, sometimes lashing out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the process.",
      "On CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, she told moderator Margaret Brennan, \"I resigned from Ukraine and also from the Foreign Service, because the policy since the beginning of the administration was to put pressure on the victim Ukraine, rather than on the aggressor, Russia. I fully agree that the war needs to end, but I believe that peace at any price is not peace at all. It's appeasement and as we know from history, appeasement only leads to more war.",
      "A career diplomat, Brink was confirmed by the Senate as ambassador to Kyiv shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, and stayed on during the early months of the Trump administration.",
      "In April, CBS reported that Brink intended to resign her post as ambassador due to an unusual mix of personal and policy concerns, including USAID layoffs. Brink had been serving in a war zone far from her family since Kyiv is designated as an unaccompanied post, where officers serve without bringing their families with them."

    "summary": "The \"Make America Healthy Again\" report outlines what it says are four leading drivers of childhood disease, but it is facing criticism from some health officials.",
    "story": [
      "The White House's \"Make America Healthy Again\" or \"MAHA\" commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has published its first report on what it says are four leading drivers of childhood chronic disease.",
      "\"The report is the product of a consensual process, and it represents a collaborative effort of all the agencies and the White House. And it represents a consensus that is probably the strongest and most radical consensus by a government agency in history about the state of America's health,\" Kennedy told reporters in a call ahead of its release.",
      "Thursday's release is the first in a process laid out by President Trump's executive order in February. By August, the commission is due to follow up with a policy strategy to address the findings raised in this report. Kennedy called the report a \"milestone.\"",
      "\"MAHA's become hot,\" Mr. Trump told a roundtable that included Kennedy and other top administration officials at the White House on Thursday.",
      "The \"chronic disease crisis\" in children is described in the report as growing rates of a number of issues including childhood obesity, diabetes, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, cancer, allergies and autoimmune disorders.",
      "\"More than 40% of American children now have at least one chronic health condition,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday. \"Since the 1970s, rates of childhood cancer have soared, in many cases, by nearly 50%. ... In the 1960s, less than 5% of the children were obese, now over 20% are obese. ... Think of this one, this is the one that gets me every time, and it seems to be getting worse \u2014 just a few decades ago, one in 10,000 children had autism. Today it's 1 in 31.\"",
      "Medical experts attribute much of the increase in autism to better and more widespread testing and diagnostics.",
      "Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that the Trump administration was not seeking \"a European, mandate-driven regulatory system that stifles growth\" as a result of the process.",
      "\"It will happen through a renewed focus on improved science throughout the federal government and our partners. And through unleashing private sector innovation to produce better solutions for our children,\" Zeldin said.",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials criticized the report, which they said misrepresented several facts and left out other well-known drivers of childhood chronic disease.",
      "\"They're looking for specific causes and silver bullets to draw attention to. However, prevention is all about making it easier for people to make healthy choices,\" said one current federal health official in a message, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "What does the MAHA report say is causing childhood chronic disease?",
      "The wide-ranging report is organized around four topics that it describes as the \"potential drivers behind the rise in childhood chronic disease that present the clearest opportunities for progress\":",
      "Poor diet, driven primarily by ultra-processed foods",
      "Cumulative exposure to chemicals like food additives and pesticides",
      "Lack of physical activity and chronic stress",
      "\"Overmedicalization\" with too many prescriptions and vaccines",
      "These largely reflect many of the themes that Kennedy has long spoken about, including as a longshot presidential candidate last year and as the head of the nation's public health agencies in recent months.",
      "\"It is very strong, it's very frank, and it is a clarion call to do something with utmost urgency to end this crisis. And that's what we wanted,\" Kennedy said of the report.",
      "For example, under the heading of ultra-processed foods, the report echoes Kennedy's criticism of the shift from using \"minimally processed animal-based sources like butter and lard\" to seed oils like corn and canola. And it takes aim at the federal dietary guidelines process, which is due to release a major update later this year.",
      "Others reflect past Kennedy priorities that stop short of his previous calls. For example, the report criticizes the \"corporate capture of media\" through advertising campaigns paid for by drugmakers, but does not call for a ban as he did in the past, acknowledging the pharmaceutical industry \"has the First Amendment right to have these\" ads.",
      "Some parts of the report mirror public health advice championed under the Biden administration, like around the \"epidemic of loneliness and isolation,\" which then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned in 2023 was driven by factors like social media and technology.",
      "It also often points to other countries as examples of how things could be done better. A section criticizing U.S. school nutrition programs cites examples from France, Japan and Nordic countries that prepare meals using healthier ingredients.",
      "What does the MAHA report say about pesticides?",
      "The report warns that no \"country in the world has fully accounted for the fact that children are often exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals,\" saying that evaluations of chemicals individually may be neglecting the \"cumulative burdens\" of multiple exposures.",
      "Pesticides are named as a potential risk to be studied alongside a list that includes PFAS, microplastics, fluoride, electromagnetic radiation and chemicals used to make plastics.",
      "\"For example, a selection of research studies on a herbicide (glyphosate) have noted a range of possible health effects, ranging from reproductive and developmental disorders as well as cancers, liver inflammation and metabolic disturbances,\" the report says.",
      "Kennedy has previously spoken out vocally against glyphosate, dating back to court battles with the manufacturer of the Roundup pesticide made from the chemical. That had worried some Republicans and the agriculture industry ahead of the report's release.",
      "The report says that an updated government assessment of common herbicides will be released in 2026 and criticizes pesticide manufacturers for having \"spent billions on research initiatives\" that may have biased studies on the topic.",
      "But the report also pledges to support U.S. farmers, acknowledging that \"precipitous changes in agriculture practices could have an adverse impact\" on the food supply and says that past federal reviews of herbicides \"did not establish a direct link\" to bad health outcomes.",
      "\"We know that the American food system is the safest in the world. It is the safest, most reliable, most robust in the world. But now we talk about how to make it even better and healthier,\" said Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.",
      "The National Corn Growers Association said it was \"deeply troubled\" by the report, saying it was \"filled with fear-based rather than science-based information about pesticides\" like atrazine and glyphosate that have been vetted by the EPA.",
      "\"If the administration's goal is to bring more efficiency to government, then why is the secretary of Health and Human Services duplicating efforts by raising questions about pesticides that have been answered repeatedly through research and reviews by federal regulatory bodies,\" the group said in a statement after the report's release.",
      "What does the MAHA report say about vaccines and medications?",
      "The report lists a number of medications that it says raise \"important questions\" about its long-term impact for use on children. The list includes antidepressants, stimulant medications for ADHD, weight loss drugs, antibiotics and acid suppressants.",
      "\"Increasingly common, these popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs with complicated metabolic effects lack neurodevelopmental and other long term safety data, raising the specter of unforeseen problems that interrupt, damage, or impair metabolism and growth development,\" the report says of GLP-1 agonist medications.",
      "It calls out the \"growth of the childhood vaccine schedule,\" which Kennedy has long denounced, often with misleading claims about how vaccines were not sufficiently vetted for safety and efficacy.",
      "\"The number of vaccinations on the American vaccine schedule exceeds the number of vaccinations on many European schedules, including Denmark, which has nearly half as many,\" the report says.",
      "The report also reiterates Kennedy's criticism of the CDC's vaccine safety monitoring efforts, like in the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System and Vaccine Safety Datalink, as well as the federal approach to compensating childhood vaccine injury.",
      "It also criticizes groups like the American Medical Association for efforts to address disinformation about vaccines, saying it \"undermines the open dialogue essential to protecting and improving children's health.\"",
      "Kennedy's approach to vaccines has put him at odds with groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, which has urged him to do more to foster confidence in the \"rigorous safety system\" for vaccines needed to protect children.",
      "\"FDA and the CDC work together to ensure that years of vaccine clinical trials and safety studies are exhaustively examined, with rigorous, respected, and accepted scientific evidence,\" the group said in a letter in March.",
      "What does the MAHA report get wrong?",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials raised a number of issues with the report, which they said misstated several facts and left out already well-documented drivers known to be causing chronic disease in children that health authorities are already working to address.",
      "Those efforts, they warned, such as work to avert lead poisoning in children, are now under-resourced in the wake of massive layoffs and further proposed budget cuts.",
      "\"This document makes it seem like we don't know what makes people sick,\" one federal health official said in a message, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Two officials pointed out maternal health and preterm birth was left out of the report, which is known to lead to a number of health problems and can be prevented through steps like quitting smoking, avoiding alcohol and getting early prenatal care. Smoking, and the need for broader efforts to prevent youth use of nicotine products, was also not mentioned in the report.",
      "Multiple officials said that scientific research and federal data had been selectively misrepresented in the report.",
      "One official pointed out that what the report highlights as a dramatic rise in childhood cancer ignores improvements in early diagnosis driving the higher rates, as well as declines in deaths.",
      "Another section of the report criticizes the federal dietary guidelines for focusing on limiting sodium instead of focusing on minimizing ultra-processed foods, which a former top FDA official said was \"very puzzling.\"",
      "\"Reducing sodium in the diet is likely the most impactful step they could take to reduce chronic disease risk, and they ignore the totality of the science, including large randomized trials of salt interventions and salt substitutes, that demonstrate important reductions in chronic diseases,\" Dr. Susan Mayne, the FDA's former top nutrition official, said in an email.",

I fought to lift the cap on SALT and ensure hardworking Long Island families see the benefits of this important legislation.

While I am frustrated that the vote was closed before I was able to cast my vote, I am proud of the work we accomplished to deliver huge results for Long Island,\" Garbarino said in a statement.",
      "As part of the bill, the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes, or SALT, would be lifted from $10,000 to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.

      "On Thursday, Kent also personally posted a statement on X defending his actions, writing, \"I'm honored to do my part.\"",
      "The final memorandum, dated April 7, asserts that the Maduro regime in Venezuela \"probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States.\" The assessment was later declassified and publicly released on May 5, following a Freedom of Information Act request by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.",
      "The question of whether Venezuela's government controls TDA has been at the center of judicial disputes surrounding the Trump administration's ability to deport suspected gang members under the seldom used Alien Enemies Act of 1798. President Trump invoked the act in a March proclamation, effectively designating suspected gang members as wartime enemies of the U.S. government.",
      "Soon after the proclamation was signed, the administration used the act to remove 137 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "\"I have been meaning to come chat with you about the attached TDA document, before we publish this in the PDB or as a wire product we need to do some re writing a little more analysis so this document is not used against the DNI or POTUS,\" Kent wrote on April 3, using abbreviations to refer to the director of national intelligence, President's Daily Brief and President Trump. \"Wire product\" likely refers to a secure communications and information-exchange platform used across the U.S. intelligence community.",
      "In the April 3 email, Kent criticized the draft memorandum from the IC \u2014 the intelligence community \u2014 for leading with \"weak IC speak that basically says we can't prove via smoking gun intel that the Ven gov is directing TDA, making it sound like the Ven gov has nothing to do with TDA,\" according to its text. He later added, \"Another major issue I have with the analysis in this piece is its lack of context about the status of our border and immigration policy over the last 4 years.\"",
      "\"I understand some may view this as political but it is not, it's a simple verifiable reality that we cannot overlook,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Going forward, we need to implement the changes above and incorporate the FBI's assessment of TDA's relationship with the Ven gov upfront, then go into the rest of the document,\" Kent wrote.",
      "The FBI's view, which appears on page 2 of the final memorandum, notes the bureau's analysts \"agree\" with the intelligence community's broader assessment that the Maduro government is not directing TDA movement but assess \"some Venezuelan government officials facilitate TDA members' migration from Venezuela\" with the goal of destabilizing the U.S. and other governments.",
      "The intelligence community assessment notes \"most of the IC judges that intelligence indicating that regime leaders are directing or enabling TDA migration to the United States is not credible.\" Another more heavily redacted section describes intelligence community reporting that suggests a link between TDA and some Venezuelan officials as \"limited.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who previously served as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday he believed the intelligence community was \"wrong\" in its assessment that the Venezuelan government does not control TDA and that he agreed \"100% with the FBI's finding.\"",
      "While it is not uncommon for analysts' views to be challenged and tested by officials within the chain of command, edits are usually sought to make assessments more reflective of existing data and evidence, and to do so irrespective of government policy, current and former intelligence officials said.",
      "Policymakers are also not bound by what intelligence assessments may find, the officials said, but collection and analysis happen in order to provide officials with an optimal operating picture.",
      "It is not entirely clear from the email exchanges obtained by CBS News and final version of the memorandum how many changes to the text were made at Kent's request.",
      "In a subsequent set of email exchanges on April 4, Kent offered suggestions to replace language in the memorandum about TDA migration trends, arguing that policies under the Biden administration were a key influencing factor.",
      "\"Lets go with something like this,\" Kent wrote, adding as a proposed edit, \"The IC also recognizes that between January 2021 and January 2025 the United States immigration policies and border security posture made migration from Venezuela to the United States so easy that the Government of Venezuela did not need to push migrants to the United States, United States immigrations [sic] policy served as its own pulling factor.\"",
      "Kent later approved another suggested revision that read, \"Increased flow of irregular migration from Venezuelan nationals-including some TDA members\u2014could be attributed to a wide perception of lax U.S. immigration policies and a lack of screening at the border between 2021 and 2025.\"",
      "\"This looks great,\" Kent responded.",
      "The language that appears in the final assessment, however, is different, suggesting there was additional deliberation before it was finalized: \"The IC also recognizes the regime appreciates migration as a safety valve, allowing discontented Venezuelans to leave. US border encounters of Venezuelan national [sic] have decreased since January because of migrant perceptions of new US enforcement policies.\"",
      "The New York Times and Reuters first reported the existence and some of the content of Kent's emails.",
      "Gabbard has since fired the NIC acting chair, Michael Collins, and his deputy, Maria Langan-Riekof, both of whom were among email recipients discussing the memorandum.",
      "\"These Biden holdovers were dismissed because they politicized intelligence,\" Kent's deputy, Alexa Henning, later\u00a0said on X.",
      "A former Green Beret, CIA officer, and Republican congressional hopeful, Kent has been a close ally of Gabbard, who personally endorsed his previous political runs. President Trump nominated Kent to head the National Counterterrorism Center, a prominent office within ODNI and a role that requires Senate confirmation, in February.",
      "On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees raised alarm about Kent's apparent attempt to align an intelligence assessment with existing government policy and said consideration of his nomination for NCTC director should pause.",
      "\"This was a blatant attempt to politicize national security to appease a president who has repeatedly shown contempt for facts and for the intelligence professionals sworn to defend this country,\" committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement on Wednesday, adding the Senate should \"immediately halt consideration\" of Mr. Kent's nomination to lead NCTC.",
      "House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes of Connecticut said, \"Seeking to strongarm analysts to suit the agenda of the President, and punishing them when they refuse to bend, is a road to national security disaster\u2014and yet that is precisely the road that this Administration has chosen.\"",
      "\"The Senate must not confirm Mr. Kent as Director of the National Counterterrorism Center without a full understanding of his actions,\" Himes said."

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 17:38:25 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration on Thursday moved to terminate a 1997 settlement known as the Flores Agreement, which established protections for migrant children.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Thursday moved to terminate a longstanding court settlement that has obligated the U.S. government for nearly three decades to provide basic rights and services to migrant children in its custody.",
      "Since 1997, the settlement, known as the Flores Agreement, has required federal U.S. immigration officials to hold migrant children in facilities that are safe and sanitary; provide them access to lawyers; and seek their expeditious release from government custody.",
      "The legal agreement has also allowed lawyers to inspect detention facilities holding migrant minors, to determine whether conditions are adequate for children and that the government is complying with the provisions of the court settlement.",
      "While the settlement initially largely only applied to unaccompanied minors, in 2015, U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee extended the protections to migrant children detained with their parents, generally limiting the detention of such minors to 20 days. The Obama administration fought that ruling, as it sought to deter migrant families crossing the southern border illegally by detaining them while their asylum cases were decided.",
      "In a filing on Thursday, the Justice Department told Gee, who is based in Los Angeles, that the Flores settlement should be \"completely\" terminated. It argued the agreement has hamstrung the executive branch from effectively setting immigration policy and incentivized illegal border crossings by migrant families and unaccompanied minors.",
      "\"After 40 years of litigation and 28 years of judicial control over a critical element of U.S. immigration policy by one district court located more than 100 miles from any international border, it is time for this case to end,\" the Justice Department said in its filing.",
      "The Justice Department also argued that, through laws and government regulations, the government has codified some of the provisions of the Flores agreement.",
      "Thursday's move was not entirely surprising. The first Trump administration also tried to terminate the Flores agreement, making similar legal and political arguments against the settlement. But its efforts were blocked by Gee, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2009, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "The Justice Department on Thursday also asked Gee to lift a ruling that blocked the Department of Homeland Security from enforcing a 2019 regulation that would have allowed the government to detain migrant families indefinitely, bypassing her 20-day limit.",
      "The Trump administration's bid will be challenged by the attorneys representing migrant children covered by the Flores agreement, which they say is critical to ensuring those minors are treated humanely while in U.S. care.",
      "\"Eliminating the Settlement's core protections would hand the government unchecked power to imprison children indefinitely in secret facilities \u2014 places with no standards, no transparency, and no accountability,\" said Mishan Wroe, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court granted the Trump administration's request to halt lower court rulings voiding removals of members from two labor boards.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed President Trump to remove two members of federal independent labor boards while legal proceedings over their firings move forward.",
      "The high court granted a request for emergency relief from the Trump administration to pause a pair of lower court rulings that voided Mr. Trump's removals of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board.",
      "\"Because the Constitution vests the executive power in the President, he may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents,\" the court said. \"The stay reflects our judgment that the Government is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power. But we do not ultimately decide in this posture whether the NLRB or MSPB falls within such a recognized exception; that question is better left for resolution after full briefing and argument.\"",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the court's decision.",
      "Kagan wrote in her dissent, \"Not since the 1950s (or even before) has a President, without a legitimate reason, tried to remove an officer from a classic independent agency\u2014a multi-member, bipartisan commission exercising regulatory power whose governing statute contains a for-cause provision. Yet now the President has discharged, concededly without cause, several such officers, including a member of the NLRB (Gwynne Wilcox) and a member of the MSPB (Cathy Harris). Today, this Court effectively blesses those deeds. I would not.\"",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had already temporarily halted the decisions to allow the Supreme Court more time to consider Mr. Trump's emergency appeal. The order from the full court means Wilcox and Harris will remain out of their jobs while the challenge to their firings continues.",
      "Wilcox and Harris' employment statuses have ping-ponged since they were informed by the Trump administration earlier this year that they were removed from their respective roles. Wilcox had been appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden and confirmed to a second five-year term in 2023. Harris was tapped by Biden to serve on the MSPB in 2022 for a seven-year term.",
      "Each official sued the Trump administration over their firings, arguing they violated the for-cause removal laws that limited the president's ability to oust them. Two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., agreed and voided the firings. The judges each said Wilcox and Harris could remain in their roles at their respective agencies while their litigation plays out.",
      "But a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit paused those decisions, allowing the president to fire Harris and Wilcox again. The two then asked the full D.C. Circuit to reconsider their cases, and it ruled 7-4 to put the district court decisions back in place, meaning Harris and Wilcox could return to their jobs while their challenges moved forward.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to step in and again allow Mr. Trump to oust Wilcox and Harris. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued in the request for emergency relief that the Constitution gives the president broad power to remove members of multimember boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" such as the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration's policy objectives for a single day \u2014 much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "He argued that a court violates Article II of the Constitution by ordering an executive officer who was removed by the president to be reinstated to their position.",
      "Sauer also argued that the NLRB and MSPB are not covered by an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "The Trump administration did not ask the Supreme Court to overturn that decision, but did suggest that it could consider whether to invalidate the for-cause removal restrictions governing members of the NLRB and MSPB as a violation of the separation of powers.",
      "But lawyers for Harris and Wilcox each warned that the administration is asking the Supreme Court to invalidate the structure of numerous agencies, putting at risk the independence of entities like the Federal Reserve Board, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Mr. Trump had indicated that he would like to fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who he appointed during his first term, writing on social media in April that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" But the president then walked back the suggestion, saying he has \"no intention\" of getting rid of the Fed chief.",
      "Neal Katyal, who served as acting solicitor general during the Obama administration and is representing Harris, wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court that the president is simply being asked to follow binding precedent, just as his predecessors have done for 90 years.",
      "\"History disproves the government's assertion that the president will be irreparably harmed if he cannot remove Harris,\" he wrote. \"No other president in our lifetimes has ever attempted to violate for-cause removal statutes in this manner. The current chief executive is not being held to a different standard.\"",
      "Katyal also said the MPSB is covered by the exception set by the Supreme Court in its 1935 decision.",
      "\"The board is the easy case,\" he said. \"If the board's structure is not constitutional under Humphrey's Executor, nothing is.\"",
      "In a separate filing, a lawyer for Wilcox, Deepak Gupta, said the statute that lays out the parameters for firing NLRB members has been on the books for nearly 100 years, and no presidential administration until now has tried to remove a member of the board.",
      "\"Nevertheless, the government now claims that its need to remove Gwynne Wilcox is urgent \u2014 so urgent that it asks this court to override the en banc D.C. Circuit's denial of a stay, jettison a century of settled interbranch practice, and signal the overruling of bedrock precedents of this court that have engendered strong reliance interests. The better course is restraint,\" he wrote.",
      "Gupta disputed the Trump administration's claim that it needs emergency relief,, which would require the Supreme Court to \"upend decades of tradition to allow the president to remove an NLRB member for the first time now \u2014 before this court has even had the opportunity to reconsider its longstanding precedent.\"",
      "Beyond the seat on the NLRB that had been filled by Wilcox and Harris' position on the MSPB, there are still vacancies at both agencies that Mr. Trump can fill. But lawyers for both have argued the president's firings have hobbled the boards and stymied their ability to adjudicate labor and employment disputes.",
      "\"By depriving the board of the quorum it needs to carry out its appellate decision making, the president's illegal removal causes immediate harm to the workers, employers, and broader public who depend on it,\" Gupta wrote.",
      "Since returning to the White House for his second term, Mr. Trump has overseen a sweeping reshaping of the executive branch. He has fired top officials leading a swath of independent agencies and institutions, and gotten rid of independent agency watchdogs. His administration is moving to dismantle other federal entities and programs, sparking legal challenges.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday blocked federal immigration officials with the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students while a legal battle moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who sits on the U.S. district court in Oakland, California, found that a group of foreign nationals who are in the country on F-1 student visas but had their legal status terminated were likely to succeed in a challenge to the Trump administration's actions.",
      "White said in a 21-page decision that federal immigration officials don't suggest that the plaintiffs pose an immediate threat to safety or national security. But the students, he wrote, will \"continue to suffer significant hardship\" because of the administration's actions, absent judicial relief.",
      "White, nominated by President George W. Bush, wrote that the relief provided to the plaintiffs gives them a \"measure of stability and certainty that they will be able to continue their studies or their employment without the threat of re-termination hanging over their heads.\"",
      "His nationwide injunction blocks immigration authorities from arresting or jailing the plaintiffs in the case or those who are similarly situated until the dispute is resolved, and from transferring them outside of the jurisdiction where they live. White's order also bars the Trump administration from reversing its reinstatement of certain international students' legal status.",
      "The cases were brought by foreign nationals who were admitted to the U.S. through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which Immigrations and Customs Enforcement oversees. The plaintiffs were in the country on F-1 visas, and records relating to their immigration status are housed in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, a database that tracks international students' compliance with their visa status.",
      "But in early April, the plaintiffs and thousands of other international students in the U.S. on F-1 visas learned that their SEVIS records had been terminated as part of the Trump administration's \"Student Criminal Alien Initiative\" for \"otherwise failing to maintain status.\"",
      "They said that terminating their SEVIS record effectively terminates their F-1 status, which governs whether they're in the U.S. lawfully. The plaintiffs said they were told their legal status had been terminated because they were \"identified in a criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who filed their lawsuit against the Trump administration last month, argued that while they each have had some contact with law enforcement, none has a criminal history that would pose a threat\u00a0to their legal status in the U.S. or render them deportable.",
      "After the international students filed their lawsuit against federal immigration authorities, a federal judge granted temporary restraining orders, which White later extended. Then, a Justice Department lawyer said that ICE had started reinstating SEVIS records for more than 4,700 students who had their student visa records terminated.",
      "But White said those changes weren't enough, and warned that the Trump administration's actions since the cases were filed \"raise the concern that they may be trying to place any future SEVIS terminations beyond judicial review.\"",
      "\"At each turn in this and similar litigation across the nation, defendants have abruptly changed course to satisfy courts' expressed concerns. It is unclear how this game of whack-a-mole will end unless defendants are enjoined from skirting their own mandatory regulations,\" he wrote.",
      "White's order came after he held a hearing on motions for preliminary injunctions last week and learned during the proceedings that ICE had been restoring SEVIS records retroactively and that the administration planned to send letters to all student visa-holders impacted by the mass cancellations.",
      "Still, he granted their requests for the injunction and rejected the Trump administration's argument that a SEVIS record is not tied to immigration status, calling it \"unpersuasive and unsupported.\"",
      "\"By terminating plaintiffs' SEVIS records, defendants altered plaintiffs' legal status within the United States,\" White wrote.",
      "He also chided the Trump administration's so-called \"Student Criminal Alien Initiative,\" and said that it underscored the need for nationwide relief.",
      "\"That initiative is a uniform policy that uniformly wreaked havoc not only on the lives of plaintiffs here but on similarly situated F-1 nonimmigrants across the United States and continues do so,\" White wrote.",

      "The back-and-forth began Tuesday, when lawyers for some of the deportees told Murphy a group of migrants was being flown to South Sudan. They warned the migrants face \"a strong likelihood of irreparable harm\" if they are deported to South Sudan, a 14-year-old country racked with violence and political instability.",
      "During a hearing Wednesday, Murphy said the attempted deportations were \"unquestionably violative\" of his April order requiring the government to give deportees notice of their final destination and a chance to challenge their removal. \"They did not offer any opportunity to object,\" the judge said.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security later identified the eight men as nationals of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Myanmar and Vietnam. In a statement, DHS listed out criminal convictions for all eight of the deportees, including murder, lascivious acts with a child and sexual assault \u2014 describing them as the \"Worst of the Worst.\"",
      "The Trump administration has blasted Murphy's ruling, with the DHS alleging he is \"trying to force the United States to bring these criminals back.\" Mr. Trump wrote on Thursday: \"The Judges are absolutely out of control, they're hurting our Country, and they know nothing about particular situations, or what they are doing.\"",
      "The government's push to ramp up deportations \u2014 in some cases sending migrants to places other than their country of origin \u2014 has drawn pushback from judges and attorneys, who argue the swift removals deprive migrants of due process. In several court districts, judges have restricted the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",

    "summary": "Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation that passed in the lower chamber early Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda in order to win over opposing factions in the GOP. And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 18 and 65, and those who do not have a child under the age of 7.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

    "summary": "The largest buyers of $TRUMP will be rewarded with a private dinner with President Trump at his golf course in Virginia.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump's new tariffs started throttling freight traffic, the leader of trucking logistics firm Freight Technologies used an unorthodox method to try and get the president's attention.",
      "The California-based firm purchased $2 million worth of Trump Coin, the signature cryptocurrency backed by Mr. Trump. The president and his family launched Trump Coin days before he took office in January. Anyone can buy the cryptocurrency. An analytics firm says Mr. Trump's family and other backers have collected more than $300 million in transaction fees so far.",
      "Donald Quinby, Freight Technologies' chief financial officer, told CBS News that the purchase seemed like \"really the best platform for us to make a splash, to make some noise.\"",
      "\"With the Trump meme token, this was just an opportunity to really advocate for free and fair trade,\" Quinby said. \"I'm sure he likes to follow who's purchasing his coins.\"",
      "In April, the Trump family announced an \"intimate private dinner\" with the president at Mr. Trump's golf course in Virginia to reward the biggest buyers of Trump Coin, or $TRUMP. A leaderboard was created so buyers could compete with one another. Buyers eventually spent $140 million trying to secure access to the event, according to data analytics firm Inca Digital.",
      "Some of the 220 leading buyers of $TRUMP received tickets to attend the dinner. Mr. Trump will also host a smaller reception for the token's top 25 holders. The guests are beneficiaries of a new opportunity to gain access and potential influence in a city with a long history of blending money and politics, experts said.",
      "\"This is really unprecedented,\" said Jessica Tillipman, a George Washington University law professor. \"This appears to be a president that could be potentially benefiting privately from something that he's doing out in the open.\"",
      "The White House pushed back hard on the notion that the gala dinner or the president's role in promoting the cryptocurrency crossed any ethical lines. Administration officials said they had not approved an initial plan suggesting top buyers of the meme coin product would receive a White House tour.",
      "\"This is a personal dinner that the president is attending on his personal time,\" a White House official told CBS News in a statement. \"The White House has absolutely nothing to do with it.\"",
      "Trump rewards cryptocurrency buyers",
      "Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is largely driven by social media buzz. They are not usually used in transactions, and are known for erratic price shifts. $TRUMP peaked at around $75 shortly after launch and plummeted to under $8 by April 2025, but soared in value after the dinner with Mr. Trump was announced.",
      "Among the attendees of Thursday's dinner is Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire and the largest holder of Trump Coin. Sun has a net worth of $8.5 billion, according to Forbes, and is best known for creating the Tron blockchain. He was also the buyer who paid $6.2 million for a banana duct-taped to a wall by artist Maurizio Cattelan. Sun promptly ate the fruit.",
      "Sun was sued for fraud by the Biden administration for allegedly \"fraudulently manipulating the secondary market\" and paying celebrities to promote a crypto token his company created \"without disclosing their compensation.\" Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused the lawsuit as part of a broader Trump administration shift toward easing crypto enforcement.",
      "Sun also said his firm has invested tens of millions in the Trump-linked World Liberty Financial. But the anonymous nature of cryptocurrency allows Sun, and other foreign buyers like him, to court access to power with little transparency.",
      "\"It's almost like the perfect kind of opaque structure for any type of foreign government or, you know, non-U.S. citizens who wanted to try to seek favor, curry favor with this particular administration,\" Tillipman\u00a0said.",
      "Experts raise concerns about conflicts of interest",
      "Tillipman compared the Trump family's foray into cryptocurrency to Hunter Biden's art sales during his father's administration.",
      "\"The argument was that [purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork] could use it to influence\" then-President Joe Biden, she said.",
      "Like cryptocurrency, \"a lot of these types of transactions are by nature opaque because you don't know who's purchasing it. You don't know who the buyer is,\" Tillipman said. She noted that in effect, the Biden administration tried to distance the president from the transactions by saying information about the buyers and transactions would be kept secret by the gallery owner.",
      "Nonetheless, she said \"there were a lot of legitimate concerns associated with that particular dealing, as there was fear that it could be a back door to President Biden\" through a family member.",
      "\"The difference here is just the order of magnitude and the involvement of the president himself,\" Tillipman said. Hunter Biden's art netted him about $1.5 million by the end of his father's presidency, compared to the potentially far more lucrative Trump family crypto business.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously vowed on social media to \"make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.\" He and his eldest sons are also backing the\u00a0crypto exchange World Liberty Financial, and cryptocurrency makes up about $2.9 billion of Mr. Trump's net worth, according to a\u00a0recent report.",
      "On Monday, the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, which would regulate stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency that is linked to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar or gold. They tend to have fewer price fluctuations than meme coins, but allow for the same opacity in transactions. Some Democrats pushed back against the bill, citing Mr. Trump's crypto holdings and calling for anti-corruption rules.",
      "\"This is corruption out in the open,\" said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, on Thursday. \"The GENIUS Act will supercharge Donald Trump's ability to collect money from anybody who is seeking pardon, who wants tariff relief, who wants a criminal prosecution dropped.\"",
      "The White House has dismissed criticisms that Mr. Trump's support for the crypto sector represents a conflict of interest.",
      "\"All of the president's assets are in a blind trust, which is managed by his children, and I would argue, one of the many reasons that the American people reelected this president back to this office is because he was a very successful businessman before giving it up to publicly serve our country,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.",
      "Quinby found that buying the meme coin didn't immediately result in access to the president. Freight Technologies didn't make it to the leaderboard, but they are prepared to keep spending. The trucking company reported in public securities filings that their investment in $TRUMP could eventually reach $20 million, if that's what it takes to get Mr. Trump's attention. Even if they lose money on the market, Quinby thinks it was worth the risk.",
      "\"We thought the ability for us to get out there and advocate for the fair and free trade, we thought it was worth it,\" Quinby said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salt-deduction-cap-trump-big-beautiful-bill-tax-40000-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 15:03:01 -0400",
    "summary": "The budget bill passed by the House includes a provision to quadruple the state and local tax deduction, a boon for some homeowners.",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. homeowners may soon get a sizable tax break thanks to the massive budget package that was passed by the House early Thursday.",
      "The legislation \u2014 dubbed the \u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 includes a provision that would lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000 from its current $10,000 limit. That could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or who earn enough to have significant state income tax liabilities.",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced by Mr. Trump in his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as a way to offset that legislation's tax breaks, such as its reduction in individual income tax rates. Prior to that law, there was no limit on how much in state and local taxes taxpayers could deduct from their federal income taxes.",
      "The unlimited SALT deduction had been criticized by some policy experts as mainly benefiting upper-income\u00a0homeowners\u00a0in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But with real estate values surging in recent years, more homeowners around the U.S. are now getting socked with higher property taxes and bumping against the SALT deduction limit, prompting some lawmakers to call for changes to the $10,000 cap.",
      "The SALT deduction limit \"really eliminated a fairly significant deduction for most taxpayers in Massachusetts, especially given how high property taxes can be here,\" Boston tax attorney Dan Ryan told CBS News Boston.",
      "The backers of the new bill \"needed to keep Republicans in New York, New Jersey and California happy,\" which led to the negotiation for a higher SALT limit, he added.",
      "To be sure, the tax and spending bill could undergo more changes before it reaches President Trump's desk. The measure must now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already expressed opposition to certain aspects of the bill, such as Medicaid spending cuts.",
      "What is the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The SALT deduction cap was introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, and capped the deduction at $10,000 for both single and married couples. The provision covers state income taxes, property taxes and sales taxes.",
      "In 2017, the Treasury Department estimated that almost 11 million taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and New Jersey would forfeit\u00a0$323 billion in deductions\u00a0because of the new cap.",
      "Some lawmakers criticized the deduction limit for its marriage penalty, given that married couples are subject to the same SALT deduction threshold as single filers. Typically, tax provisions are more generous for married couples because they are designed to cover two individuals. For instance, the standard deduction for married couples is $30,000 in 2025, double the $15,000 standard deduction for single filers.",
      "What's changing with the SALT deduction cap?",
      "The House tax bill lifts the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, with the new threshold scheduled to take effect for the current 2025 tax year. An earlier version of the bill had proposed a $30,000 deduction limit, but some lawmakers pushed for a higher threshold to help more homeowners.",
      "The change was hailed by Republicans from high-tax congressional districts. Rep. Mike Lawler of New York said in a social media post that the increased SALT limit would ease \"the tax burden for middle-class and working families.\"",
      "\"This includes annual increases for inflation and income caps to ensure this is not a handout for the uber wealthy,\" Lawler added.",
      "The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. Those who earn above that amount would face a phaseout, although the deduction wouldn't go lower than $10,000. Both the cap and the income limit would increase 1% per year over the next decade, according to a May 22 analysis from law firm Kutak Rock.",
      "Who could benefit from the higher SALT cap?",
      "People whose deductible expenses \u2014 including property taxes, state income taxes and mortgage interest \u2014 exceed their standard deduction could benefit from the higher SALT cap.",
      "For instance, a married couple would need those costs to surpass their 2025 standard deduction of $30,000 to take advantage of the higher SALT cap. That's because taxpayers typically claim whatever is higher \u2014 the standard deduction or their total itemized deductions \u2014 to maximize the amount they can tap to lower their federal tax liability.",
      "\"It will benefit homeowners, especially people who live in wealthier towns with higher property taxes, and higher income taxpayers,\" Ryan, the tax attorney, told CBS News Boston.",
      "High-income homeowners would be the most likely to qualify for the new deduction, with more than half of the benefit going to taxpayers making at least $400,000, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "How much would raising the SALT cap cost the U.S.?",
      "If adopted, lifting the SALT cap would result in the federal government forgoing more tax revenue, policy experts say.",
      "The $40,000 limit would result in a loss of nearly $334 billion in tax revenue over the next decade, when compared with keeping the $10,000 cap in place, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania nonpartisan group that analyzes the fiscal impact of policy.",
      "That adds to the cost of a bill that has been criticized by some experts\u00a0and lawmakers as introducing new tax breaks that could outstrip any savings in the legislation and trillions to the U.S. debt.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model \"has projected that America will face certain risk of a fiscal crisis within the next two decades, eroding household purchasing power, unless action is taken to reduce federal deficits,\" Kent Smetters, head of the group, said in a email after the House passed the budget package.",

The idea that Defendants' actions are merely a 'reorganization' is plainly not true,\" Joun wrote in his decision.",
      "\"Defendants do acknowledge, as they must, that the Department cannot be shut down without Congress's approval, yet they simultaneously claim that their legislative goals (obtaining Congressional approval to shut down the Department) are distinct from their administrative goals (improving efficiency),\" Joun wrote.",
      "\"There is nothing in the record to support these contradictory positions,\" Joun wrote. \"Not only is there no evidence that Defendants are pursuing a 'legislative goal' or otherwise working with Congress to reach a resolution, but there is also no evidence that the RIF has actually made the Department more efficient. Rather, the record is replete with evidence of the opposite.\"",

    "summary": "The Treasury Department said it placed its final order for penny blanks this month as the U.S. moves to end production of the 1-cent coin.",
    "story": [
      "The Treasury Department said it plans to stop manufacturing the penny, calling time on one of the first coins minted by the U.S. government.",
      "The federal agency placed its final order for penny blanks this month, with the United States Mint slated to end manufacturing of the penny when that runs out, a Treasury official told CBS MoneyWatch. The blanks \u2014 flat, metal discs that the Mint turns into coins \u2014 will run out in early 2026, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.",
      "The penny, which dates from the early days of the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. The 1-cent coin cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",
      "Ending production of the penny will save the Mint about $56 million in annual savings, the Treasury said on Thursday.",
      "Despite their coppery look, pennies are mostly made of zinc, with their distinctive appearance coming from a copper overlay. Zinc's cost per metric ton is more than double what it was in 2000, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "The Trump administration had recently signaled it was out to stop making the 1-cent coin, with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency saying in January that the penny was too costly\u00a0to produce. In February, President Trump said he had directed the Treasury to stop minting new pennies, citing the rising production costs.",
      "\"For far too long the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents. This is so wasteful!\" Mr. Trump wrote in a February post on his Truth Social site. \"I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.\"",
      "Previous presidential administrations have also scrutinized the penny due to the rising cost of production, with former Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew\u00a0pushing the idea\u00a0in 2015.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 12:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The budget package addresses President Trump's tax, defense and energy priorities. It now heads to the Senate, where hurdles remain.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House narrowly passed President Trump's domestic policy bill Thursday following a dramatic all-night session and days of negotiations.",
      "In a 215 to 214 vote, all but two House Republicans supported the massive budget package \u2014 the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda \u2014 in a vote that came hours after unveiling an updated version of the legislation that GOP leaders hoped would satisfy enough holdouts. GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio opposed the bill. House Freedom Caucus chairman Andy Harris of Maryland voted present.",
      "The measure cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the wee hours of the morning, teeing up the vote on final passage after days of consternation among the House Republican conference.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition.",
      "\"We look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this once-in-a-generation legislation,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said after the vote Thursday, pledging to get the package to the president's desk in the coming weeks. \"We're going to get it there by Independence Day on July 4, and we are going to celebrate a new golden age in America.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt posted on social media that the bill's passage \"would not have happened without President Trump's leadership.\"",
      "The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities, and has overcome several setbacks since the beginning of the year after GOP leadership made repeated assurances to holdouts that their concerns would be addressed later if they kept the legislation moving forward.",
      "But as Johnson's self-imposed deadline to get the measure across the finish line in the House by Memorial Day quickly approached, the Louisiana Republican was facing increasing opposition from several factions of his party to parts of the bill involving Medicaid, the state and local tax deduction and other provisions.",
      "A 42-page manager's amendment released by House GOP leaders late Wednesday included changes to win over both the budget hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus and blue-state Republicans pressing to ease the tax burden on their constituents. The new version would, among other things, move up the implementation of Medicaid work requirements from the beginning of 2029 to the end of 2026, a change sought by hardliners.",
      "Another change to the bill would more quickly end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "Johnson could only afford three defections on the bill, with all members present and voting, given his slim majority. Massie was the sole Republican to oppose the key procedural vote on the measure earlier Thursday.",
      "\"If something is beautiful, you don't do it after midnight,\" Massie said on the House floor.",
      "Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, delivered his final pitch to House Republicans ahead of the vote, urging that the bill will deliver on GOP promises.",
      "\"If you vote no, you're voting against American energy, you're voting against securing America's border, you're voting against helping those middle class families,\" Scalise said.",
      "Johnson touted the legislation on the House floor, saying it \"gets Americans back to winning again.\"",
      "\"This one big beautiful bill is the most consequential legislation that any, any party has passed, certainly under a majority this thin,\" the speaker said.",
      "All Democrats opposed the package. And after House Democrats threw up procedural roadblocks overnight to delay a vote on the measure, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries railed against the bill in a speech from the House floor early Thursday, calling it a \"reckless, regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam.\"",
      "\"This is one big, ugly bill that House Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people under the cover of darkness,\" Jeffries said.",
      "The New York Democrat, alluding to the midterm elections next year, warned that \"this day might very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.\"",
      "The vote came after right-wing holdouts met Wednesday afternoon with Mr. Trump and Johnson at the White House. After the meeting, Johnson huddled with other members of the Republican conference to brief them on the changes while House Freedom Caucus members met separately.",
      "Before the White House meeting Wednesday, Harris, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, said he wasn't optimistic the bill could pass this week, though he was \"pretty confident\" it could be passed within 10 days.",
      "But other budget hardliners said after the meeting that negotiations were headed in the right direction.",
      "During a visit to the Capitol Tuesday, Mr. Trump pressured Republicans to fall in line behind the legislation and suggested that those who don't could face primary challenges.",
      "In a statement of administrative policy issued Wednesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget urged House Republicans to pass the measure, saying it \"reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration,\" adding, \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "The details of the updated version of the legislation came together in the final hours before the vote.",
      "Johnson also negotiated with Republicans from blue states over a provision on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The moderates advocated for an increase to the SALT cap, currently set at $10,000, but argued that the $30,000 cap outlined in the package remained too low. An agreement was reached to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, according to the managers amendment.",
      "The vote marks a key victory for Johnson, after days of shepherding his conference through difficult disagreement over the legislation. But even with the victory, the legislation is expected to face resistance in the Senate \u2014 where numerous Republicans have said they'll seek changes to the bill.",
      "Johnson met with Senate Republicans to discuss the budget process Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the speaker would \"like to see as little change to the product as possible, because they cobble together a very delicate balance over there.\" But Thune said \"the Senate will have its imprint on it.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4, blocking the attempt to establish the nation's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An evenly divided Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a lower court decision that invalidated a contract approved by the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board that established the nation's first religious charter school, blocking the effort in a closely watched case that posed a test for the separation of church and state.",
      "The high court split 4-4, which leaves in place the decision of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Justice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate in the case. The high court issued a one line, unsigned decision stating \"the judgment is affirmed by an equally divided court.\"",
      "Argued at the end of April, the legal fight could have opened the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools. But following the arguments, it appeared that the outcome of the case would hinge on Chief Justice John Roberts, who focused on the level of state involvement in its charter school program. The issue of whether religious institutions must be permitted to participate in state charter school systems is likely to land before the Supreme Court again in a case likely to involve all nine justices.",
      "The legal battle over the attempt to create St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma came on the heels of a trio of recent rulings in which the Supreme Court sided with religious families and institutions challenging state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violating the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause.",
      "In 2017, the high court ruled that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court said that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said\u00a0Maine cannot limit\u00a0a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "Nicole Stelle Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who authored a\u00a0paper\u00a0that suggested states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause, said she was disappointed with the decision but noted that it does not set precedent.",
      "\"The question whether barring religious charter schools violates the Constitution remains live, and I remain confident that the Court will eventually rule that it does,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Garnett is friends with Barrett, who also taught at Notre Dame Law School before she became a judge. The university's Religious Liberty Clinic represented St. Isidore.",
      "A decision in favor of the school could have led to the country's first religious charter school. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican who argued against establishment of the school, had warned that a decision allowing its contract to stand would upend laws in at least 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian.",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like at least 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a\u00a02023 report\u00a0from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation,\u00a0according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond\u00a0warned\u00a0against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an\u00a0earlier analysis\u00a0from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "Oklahoma's charter school board and St. Isidore's appealed the state court ruling to the Supreme Court, and it said in January it would review that decision.",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 11:36:03 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's missile defense project, called the \"Golden Dome for America,\" could cost hundreds of billions of dollars.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's missile defense project, called the \"Golden Dome for America,\" aims to protect the U.S. from foreign threats. But it has a steep price and has been criticized by China as threatening to increase the risks of militarizing space and a global arms race.",
      "The president on Tuesday said his administration had \"selected an architecture\" for the \"state-of-the-art system,\" which could cost hundreds of billions of dollars and put U.S. weapons in space for the first time in history.",
      "What is the Golden Dome and how will it work?",
      "The Golden Dome is a multilayered defense system that the president, speaking in the Oval Office alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, said will deploy \"next-generation technologies across the land, sea and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors.\"",
      "\"The Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world and even if they are launched from space,\" the president said, adding that he wants it to be operational before his term ends.",
      "The concept includes both ground- and space-based capabilities that would defend against missiles by: detecting and destroying them ahead of launch, intercepting them early in flight, halting them midcourse and stopping them in the last few moments of approaching a target.",
      "The initiative would have multiple layers that expand on what the U.S. already has and build new programs to counter the full range of aerial threats, according to Gen. Gregory Guillot, the head of U.S. Northern Command, who testified in front of Congress in April.",
      "He described a domain awareness layer to track threats and then two other layers: \"the first being an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) defeat layer, which largely exists today with the GBIs (ground-based interceptors) that can defeat a North Korean threat and then an air layer that would defeat cruise missiles and air threats.\"",
      "\"The time to intercept a missile is when it launches,\" retired Gen. Frank McKenzie, a CBS News contributor and former commander of the U.S. Central Command, said on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" Thursday. He said that early in a missile's flight, it is on \"a highly predictable\" path, can't maneuver and can't deploy systems to spoof radars, making that the ideal time to disable it.",
      "\"And to do that, you really have to go into space. You have to have a space-based system to do that,\" McKenzie said. \"That's very possible. We've looked at this at different times.\"",
      "McKenzie added he hopes \"that's where our thinking and our science is going to take us.\"",
      "\"This is not going to be off the cuff,\" Tom Karako, the director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CBS News in an interview.",
      "\"This is going to be well-rooted in the systems engineering and the understanding of the threat and in the overall architecture plans that have been in the works for a long time,\" Karako said.",
      "How much will the Golden Dome cost?",
      "The new initiative, which will encompass many programs, will be built in states including Florida, Georgia, Indiana and Alaska, according to Mr. Trump, and involve multiple American defense and technology companies that have not yet been selected.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office has estimated a cost of $542 billion for the space-based components alone.",
      "\"The cost is certainly a daunting thing,\" McKenzie said. \"But on the other hand, the ability to defend the United States against a nuclear attack, not necessarily a massive Russian attack, but, you know, an attack from North Korea, an attack from Iran, a potential attack from a country like Pakistan, who's working to develop an ICBM. Those are all things that I think are feasible, and I think certainly are worth the cost that would be necessary to work the system.\"",
      "Aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, which said on X it is ready to support the dome mission, describes it as a \"revolutionary concept.\"",
      "\"This is a Manhattan Project-scale mission, one that is both urgent and crucial to America's security,\" the company says.",
      "Lockheed Martin COO Frank St. John said it would protect against nuclear missiles, as well as intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles, and other threats.",
      "Mr. Trump said U.S. Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein would be responsible for overseeing the dome's progress.",
      "However, there is no funding yet to match the plan, which is \"still in the conceptual stage,\" Air Force Secretary Troy Meink told senators on Tuesday at a hearing. The Pentagon is also still developing the requirements that the dome will have to meet, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Israel's Iron Dome",
      "The Golden Dome idea first came to public light during Mr. Trump's joint address to Congress in March, when he asked for funding for it. He said, \"Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it, too.\"",
      "The president was referring to Israel's Iron Dome, which at least partially inspired the Golden Dome concept. Israel's system, installed in 2011 to defend against incoming projectiles, largely addresses shorter-range threats like rockets, while two other air defense systems work to defend against missiles.",
      "The Iron Dome, developed with U.S. backing, has intercepted thousands of rockets and has a success rate topping 90%, according to Israel.",
      "China responds",
      "Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said her country urges the U.S. \"to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself,\" she said at a Wednesday briefing in Beijing, according to news agencies. \"This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this.\"",
      "She also said the Golden Dome plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield\" and \"fuels an arms race.\"",
      "\"It's kind of humorous that the Chinese would talk about militarizing space, since I would guess they've done more work on militarizing space than any other nation in the world,\" McKenzie said. \"I would argue this is an inherently defensive system, and it's designed to protect the United States from attack.\"",
      "A U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency assessment shows that the U.S. military expects, over the coming decade, to contend with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication.\" It also said that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "China has been rapidly developing missile and other military capabilities, while deepening ties with Russia. The two nations said in a statement earlier this month that the dome project was \"deeply destabilizing in nature\" and would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",
      "Karako said that the Golden Dome initiative is \"a belated realignment of U.S. missile defense policy\" to counter both China and Russia, countries that the last two administrations in their national defense strategies have pointed to as strategic competitors.",
      "\"Could [the Golden Dome] launch another spiral of offensive developments to try to break through?\" McKenzie said. \"Certainly that's possible. And I recognize that's a possibility. Having said that, I still think it's an objective worth pursuing.\"",

    "summary": "DHS officials said the eight men were in the U.S. illegally from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam, and all had criminal convictions.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday said it placed eight migrant detainees with serious criminal records on a deportation flight that lawyers alleged was destined for the violence-plagued African country of South Sudan, in its latest attempt to deport migrants to countries that are not their own.",
      "The administration has not publicly disclosed the whereabouts of the flight, which a federal judge on Wednesday said \"unquestionably\" violated a court ruling blocking deportations to third countries without allowing detainees to contest their removal.",
      "Top Department of Homeland Security officials said the eight men were in the U.S. illegally and hailed from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam. The department shared case information indicating all the would-be deportees had criminal convictions, including for homicide, attempted murder, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "In a statement Wednesday evening, DHS released the names of the eight men. They were identified as Dian Peter Domach of South Sudan, Enrique Arias-Hierro of Cuba, Jose Manuel Rodriguez-Quinones of Cuba, Thongxay Nilakout of Laos, Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez of Mexico, Kyaw Mya of Myanmar, Nyo Myint of Myanmar and Tuan Thanh Phan of Vietnam.",
      "On Tuesday, immigration lawyers told the federal district court in Massachusetts that at least two men from Myanmar and Vietnam were likely being deported to South Sudan, saying the reported deportation flight would violate an order by federal judge Brian Murphy that blocked deportations to third countries unless detainees were provided certain due process rights.",
      "During a briefing in Washington on Wednesday to discuss a migrant flight to South Sudan, top DHS officials confirmed a deportation flight had left Texas on Tuesday, saying the eight detainees from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam were being transported as part of \"a diplomatic and military security operation.\"",
      "The officials, however, declined to confirm the final destination of the flight or any formal arrangement with South Sudan's government, citing operational and safety concerns. The officials also said they could not disclose the exact whereabouts of the detainees.",
      "Following an emergency motion by the lawyers who alerted him of the potential deportation flight to South Sudan, Murphy, the federal judge in Massachusetts, ordered the Trump administration late Tuesday to retain \"custody and control\" of the would-be deportees.",
      "In a written order Wednesday, the judge also ordered the government to give six deportees \"reasonable fear\" interviews, which usually assess whether a migrant is legally entitled to stay in the U.S. because of a risk of persecution or torture. If they express a fear that falls short of that standard, they must get at least 15 days to \"reopen immigration proceedings to challenge the potential third-party removal,\" the judge said.",
      "The Trump administration was also ordered to provide status reports every seven days, and to maintain custody over the deportees.",
      "On Wednesday, top DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the eight men who had been placed on the deportation flight that departed Texas remained in U.S. custody.",
      "McLaughlin also sharply criticized Murphy's ruling. \"It is absolutely absurd for a district judge to try and dictate the foreign policy and national security of the United States of America,\" McLaughlin said, accusing Murphy of \"trying to force\" officials to bring back dangerous individuals to the U.S.",
      "During a hearing Wednesday, a Justice Department lawyer told Murphy the flight in question had landed somewhere and also confirmed the men remained in U.S. custody but said the current location of the flight could only be discussed in private, out of earshot of the press.",
      "The Justice Department said the situation was dangerous for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees on the flight because of the severity of the detainees' criminal records.",
      "After a private conversation with both parties, Murphy said that the government's attempted deportations \"are unquestionably violative of this court's order.\" He noted that the detainees were put on the deportation flight less than 24 hours after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "\"I don't see how anybody could say that these individuals had a meaningful opportunity to object\" to their removal, Murphy said. \"They did not offer any opportunity to object.\" Murphy noted the detainees were put on a deportation flight less than a day after being told they would be deported to South Sudan.",
      "The Justice Department attorneys arguing the case said Murphy's orders in the case were \"not specific enough,\" which gave rise to \"misunderstanding.\"",
      "Murphy did not rule out holding the Trump administration in contempt of court for violating his order, but said that issue would be \"left for another day.\"",
      "As part of its immigration crackdown, President Trump's administration has staged an intense diplomatic effort to convince nations around the world to accept migrants who are not their own citizens, approaching nations like Libya and Rwanda to take in third-country deportees.",
      "Early on in Mr. Trump's second term, U.S. officials deported African and Asian migrants to Costa Rica and Panama, and Venezuelan deportees accused of being gang members to El Salvador, where they remain detained at a notorious mega prison.",

    "story": [
      "Refugee admissions to the United States have all but ground to a halt \u2014 except for one group, or a \"small subset,\" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them on Tuesday: Afrikaners. They are members of the White ethnic minority that once led South Africa's brutal, four-decade apartheid regime, which ended in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president.",
      "The Trump administration has already welcomed the first group of Afrikaner asylum applicants, who were given expedited refugee status after claiming they were the victims of violence and discrimination in South Africa.",
      "Other Afrikaners are waiting, keen to take advantage of the offer of special treatment from the Trump administration to gain protected status and the right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "Those hopefuls have been meeting to share information on the process, including Dolf Grobler, who has already applied. The professional hunter told CBS News he has $2.5 million to help make America great again.",
      "\"I'm worried that the genocide, which is currently mainly focused on White farmers, is going to spread,\" he said. The claim of a White genocide is one that President Trump's adviser Elon Musk, whose family are Afrikaners, has backed.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday as the U.S. leader hosted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa for an official visit. The Afrikaner refugee program was a topic of discussion, along with trade and other matters. In the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted.",
      "\"Those people in many cases, are being executed, being executed, and they happen to be White, and most happen to be farmers,\" Mr. Trump said, calling the situation \"sort of the opposite of apartheid.\"",
      "\"People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people,\" Ramaphosa said.",
      "According to South African police, in the last three months of 2024, 12 people were murdered on farms there; one was a White farmer, while the others were Black laborers or security workers.  Asked if he believed life for him and his family was better under apartheid \u2014 an overtly racist minority-rule system that denied equal rights to South Africa's vast majority Black population \u2014 Grobler didn't hesitate.",
      "\"Yes,\" he told CBS News. \"I can't say in my heart that we are better off now.\" Although he did concede apartheid was wrong.",
      "Claims of a White genocide are often circulated by right-wing groups, but the view is not held widely within the Afrikaner community.",
      "Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, an academic at North-West University in South Africa, says the claims are simply untrue.",
      "\"There's no sign of it, never has been. In fact, Whites are economically the strongest group\" in South Africa, Croucamp told CBS News. \"64% of all boardrooms in South Africa are still White. The average incomes of White South Africans are vastly higher than Black South Africans ... they have better schools, they have better education, private health care. This is the land of milk and honey if you're White.\"",
      "Croucamp suspects the South African government's strong stance against Israel's actions in Gaza, and its relations with China, could have played some part in Mr. Trump's decision to embrace the controversial amnesty program for Afrikaners, but he believes there's more to it.",
      "\"In South Africa, right-wing groups, so-called civil society groups, we know that they have access to the Trump administration because they claim that. And just over the last few days, they have, several times, they said that they will speak to the American government, as if they have access to them. And if you listen to what Trump has said, it corresponds exactly with the genocide narrative that they sell and that they market,\" Croucamp said. \"So, I'm afraid I have to believe them when they say they have direct access to the Trump administration, and we see what Trump has been doing.\"",
      "Grilled about the refugee program Tuesday on Capitol Hill, in a testy exchange with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Secretary of State Rubio insisted that U.S. foreign policy \"doesn't require even-handedness, it involves prioritizing the interests of the United States. ... The United States has a right to pick and choose who they allow into the United States.\"",
      "White South Africans make up only about 7% of the country's population, but they still own more than half of all its farmland. And while the country has a staggeringly high crime rate, racial motives are not generally a factor, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein.",
      "He acknowledged that violent attacks on farmers do occur, especially in agricultural land near big cities, where there are often large, impoverished populations, but he said overall, \"I feel safe. I sleep with my doors open here on the farm.\"",
      "There have also been allegations that White farmers are the victims of land expropriation, with the government seizing farms without providing compensation. In January, Ramaphosa signed into law measures to expropriate mostly unused land for public use,  which his government said was necessary to address the consequences of decades of apartheid. While the law provides for fair compensation in most cases, it also allows for expropriation without compensation under limited  circumstances. And any measures can be challenged in court.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that it unfairly targets White landowners, though the law does not mention the race of anyone who could be affected under the legislation.",
      "And more importantly, there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended.",
      "Serfontein argues the problem isn't a deliberate effort by the government to seize White-owned land without compensation, but rather \"because of a dysfunctional government. The model is wrong.\"",
      "He said that for decades, land has been handed over to a Black population with compensation for former owners under established rules, but without any support for the new owners. So, almost a decade ago, Serfontein helped to launch a project aimed at training new Black farmers to work the land.",
      "To date, he says he's personally helped train more than 700 young Black farmers \u2014 the country's next generation of agricultural workers.",
      "\"I'm extremely positive, and so are the young people, the young farmers, they are positive,\" he said.",
      "As for a white genocide, he agreed with Croucamp, saying bluntly: \"It's not happening.\"",
      "Serfontein said he didn't know the histories of the Afrikaners who had already left for the U.S., and he didn't doubt they \"probably had some unhappy experiences in South Africa, about a number of things. But let me tell you that if you went to NAMPO last week \u2014 NAMPO is the biggest agricultural show in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 you would have found a vibe there between the farmers, young farmers, old farmers, Black farmers, White farmers, that you've never experienced before. They are so excited about the future of South Africa.\"",

In March, the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cut funding for about $1 billion worth of U.S. Department of Agriculture programs. The two federal programs that were cut allowed schools and food banks to purchase food directly from local farmers and producers.",

      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Ramaphosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans.",
      "The president said white crosses seen in the video showed burial sites of White farmers. In fact, they were part of a\u00a0protest, filmed near Normandien, South Africa, on Sept. 5, 2020, after the killing of Glen and Vida Rafferty, a White farming couple. Participants\u00a0said\u00a0the demonstration aimed to draw attention to all farm murders in the region, not solely those involving White farmers. Elon Musk previously shared the same video on X, posting it on\u00a0March 8\u00a0and\u00a0May 13\u00a0with the claim that the crosses represented White farmers.",

      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

It is deliberate violence, the calculated cruelty of a government that tears families apart without remorse.\"",
      "The ACLU said the refusal by ICE and the prison contractor GEO Group came after multiple requests from Khalil's legal team pointing to federal policies that encourage contact visits between children and their detained parents. Officials, they said, cited \"a blanket no-contact visitation policy at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center (CLIPC) and unspecified 'security concerns' relating to the presence of a mother and newborn baby in an unsecure part of the facility.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/noaa-hurricane-season-forecast-2025/",
    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 20:12:56 -0400",
    "summary": "With the 2025 hurricane season starting June 1, NOAA forecasters announced their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ten days before start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced their forecast for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year. The current outlook predicts a 60% chance of an \"above-normal\" hurricane season, with between 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes, forecasters said.",
      "They estimated there's a 30% chance of a \"near-normal\" season and a 10% chance of a \"below-normal\" season.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, releases its seasonal hurricane outlook each spring. It incorporates research from the Climate Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, all branches of the agency.",
      "Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham presented the findings during a news conference Thursday morning at the Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center in Gretna, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans. They chose that location to commemorate the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, 20 years after that storm devastated the area.",
      "In their remarks, Grimm and Graham each emphasized the technological developments that have allowed NOAA and the weather service to produce forecasts that are more accurate with each passing year.",
      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning from current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the outlook said, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "NOAA's forecasting model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System or HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade that officials believe could increase the accuracy of storm tracking by about 5%.",
      "\"In my 30 years at the National Weather Service, we've never had more advanced models and warning systems in place to monitor the weather,\" said Graham in a statement. \"This outlook is a call to action: be prepared. Take proactive steps now to make a plan and gather supplies to ensure you're ready before a storm threatens.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

      "Since the 1970s, scientists have studied dark streaks seen on Mars' cliff sides and crater walls. The streaks tend to be hundreds of meters long. Some can last for a long time, while others are more short-lived. Those more short-lived slope streaks, called recurring slope lineae, or RSLS, tend to recur in the same areas from year to year, according to a news release announcing the study.",
      "Some scientists believe the streaks are proof of flowing water on the planet and could suggest the Red Planet is home to habitable environments. Others believe the streaks are caused by dry processes, like rock falls or wind gusts, and said the streaks only appear like liquid remnants because scientists are studying orbital images.",
      "Adomas Valantinas, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University, and Valentin Bickel, a researcher at Switzerland's University of Bern, used machine learning to study the streaks. The process cataloged more than 86,00 high-resolution satellite images of the slope streaks and RSLs. That created a first-of-its-kind global Martian map showing more than half a million such features.",

      "The analysis, published in Nature on Monday, found that the slope streaks were not \"generally associated with factors that suggest a liquid or frost origin,\" according to the news release. Such factors would include a specific orientation of slopes, high humidity or surface temperature fluctuations.",
      "What the study did find was that the slopes were more likely to form in places that had above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, likely pointing to a dry origin. The slope streaks were more often found near recent-impact craters and could be caused when shockwaves shake surface dust. RSLs are more common in areas with frequent rockfalls or dust devils.",
      "\"Our study reviewed these features but found no evidence of water. Our model favors dry formation processes,\" Valantinas said.",
      "The results of the study cast doubt on claims that slope streaks could be signs of habitable regions. That means that researchers could send rovers or other spacecraft to explore the areas without contaminating the sites.",

    "story": [
      "Florida was the first state to pass a law regulating the use of cellphones in schools in 2023. Just two years later, half of all states have laws in place \u2014 with more likely to act soon.",
      "Bills have sprinted through legislatures this year in states as varied as New York and Oklahoma, reflecting a broad consensus that phones are bad for kids.",
      "Last week, Connecticut state Rep. Jennifer Leeper, a Democrat and co-chair of the General Assembly's Education Committee, called phones \"a cancer on our kids\" that are \"driving isolation, loneliness, decreasing attention and having major impacts both on social-emotional well-being but also learning.\"",
      "Republicans express similar sentiments.",
      "\"This is a not just an academic bill,\" Republican Rep. Scott Hilton said after Georgia's bill, which only bans phones in grades K-8, passed in March. \"This is a mental health bill. It's a public safety bill.\"",
      "So far, 25 states have passed laws, with eight other states and the District of Columbia implementing rules or making recommendations to local districts. Of the states, 16 have acted this year. Just Tuesday, Alaska lawmakers required schools to regulate cellphones when they overrode an education package that Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy had vetoed for unrelated reasons.",
      "More action is coming as bills await a governor's signature or veto in Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and New Hampshire.",
      "Teachers and administrators have long known cellphones were major distractions in learning: A\u00a02023 Pew survey showed 72%\u00a0 of high school teachers\u00a0view cellphones as a major problem in their classrooms. And U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy has\u00a0issued an advisory\u00a0on the effects of social media on youth mental health.",
      "Aside from academic benefits, cellphone restrictions can assist with social development and creating community at the school, Kim Whitman a parent-turned-advocate told CBS News last year. Whitman, a co-founder of Phone Free, said if schools \"allow phones to be present it's hard for students to connect and create a sense of belonging.\"",
      "More focus on bans throughout school day",
      "When Florida first acted, lawmakers ordered schools to ban phones during instructional time while allowing them between classes or at lunch. But now there's another bill awaiting Gov. Ron DeSantis' action that goes further. It would ban phones for the entire school day for elementary and middle schools.",
      "Nine states and the District of Columbia have enacted school day bans, most for students in grades K-12, and they now outnumber the seven states with instructional time bans.",
      "North Dakota Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong called the ban throughout the school day that he signed into law \"a huge win.\"",
      "\"Teachers wanted it. Parents wanted it. Principals wanted it. School boards wanted it,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Armstrong recently visited a grade school with such a ban in place. He said he saw kids engaging with each other and laughing at tables during lunch.",
      "The \"bell-to-bell\" bans have been promoted in part by ExcelinEd, the education think tank founded by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The group's political affiliate has been active in lobbying for bans.",
      "Nathan Hoffman, ExcelinEd's senior director of state policy and advocacy, said barring phones throughout the day heads off problems outside of class, like when students set up or record fights in halls.",
      "\"That's often when you get some of your biggest behavioral issues, whether they go viral or not,\" Hoffman said.",
      "Some states want districts to set rules",
      "But other states, particularly where there are strong traditions of local school control, are mandating only that school districts adopt some kind of cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access. In Maine, where some lawmakers originally proposed a school day ban, lawmakers are now considering a rewritten bill that would only require a policy.",
      "And there have been a few states where lawmakers failed to act at all. Maybe the most dramatic was in Wyoming, where senators voted down a bill in January, with some opponents saying teachers or parents should set the rules.",
      "Where policymakers have moved ahead, there's a growing consensus around exceptions. Most states are letting students use electronic devices to monitor medical needs and meet the terms of their special education plans. Some are allowing exceptions for translation devices if English isn't a student's first language or when a teacher wants students to use devices for classwork.",
      "There are some unusual exceptions, too. South Carolina's original policy allowed an exception for students who are volunteer firefighters. West Virginia's new law allows smartwatches as long as they are not being used for communication.",
      "Opposition from some parents, students",
      "But by far the most high-profile exception has been allowing cellphone use in case of emergencies. One of the most common parent objections to a ban is that they would not be able to contact their child in a crisis like a school shooting.",
      "\"It was only through text messages that parents knew what was happening,\" said Tinya Brown, whose daughter is a freshman at Apalachee High School, northeast of Atlanta, where a shooting killed two students and two teachers in September. She spoke against Georgia's law at a news conference in March.",
      "Some laws call for schools to find other ways for parents to communicate with their children at schools, but most lawmakers say they support giving students access to their cellphones, at least after the immediate danger has passed, during an emergency.",
      "In some states, students have testified in favor of regulations, but it's also clear that many students, especially in high schools, are chafing under the rules. Kaytlin Villescas, a sophomore at Prairieville High School, in the suburbs of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is one student who took up the fight against bans, starting a petition and telling WBRZ-TV in August that Louisiana's law requiring a school day ban is misguided. She argued that schools should instead teach responsible use.",
      "\"It is our proposition that rather than banning cellphone use entirely, schools should impart guidelines on responsible use, thereby building a culture of respect and self-regulation,\" Villescas wrote in an online petition.",
      "Most states provide no funding for laws",
      "A few states have provided money for districts to buy lockable phone storage pouches or other storage solutions. New York, for example, plans to spend $13.5 million. But states have typically provided no cash. New Hampshire lawmakers stripped a proposed $1 million from their bill.",

The bill cleared the lower chamber last month after the Senate passed the measure in February.",
      "\"This will be the first-ever federal law to combat the distribution of explicit, imagery posted without subjects' consent,\" Mr. Trump said during a bill signing event at the White House. \"We will not tolerate online sexual exploitation.\"",
      "The law requires social media companies and other websites to remove images and videos, including deepfakes generated by artificial intelligence, within 48 hours after a victim's request. Those convicted of intentionally distributing\u00a0explicit images without a subject's consent face prison time.",

    "story": [
      "Arlington, Virginia \u2014 Soldiers of the U.S. Army's Old Guard are taking on intensive drills as they prepare to resume next month their sacred and solemn duty of using horse-drawn caissons, or carriages, for servicemembers being laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery.",
      "These horse-drawn funerals were suspended by the Army in May 2023 following the deaths of two of the horses within a 96-hour period back in February 2022, prompting an Army investigation.",
      "As CBS News previously reported, other horses pulling the caissons were also suffering painful muscle and tendon injuries. At the time, the Army said that 27 Arlington horses were\u00a0sent to multiple rehabilitation facilities, and the horses were replaced with hearses.",
      "The horses were performing up to eight funerals a day, in all weather, and pulling wagons that weighed more than a ton.",
      "Most of those horses are retired now, replaced by dozens of new ones.",
      "But Army commanders knew they needed professional help to bring the caissons back. So, they called in equestrian David O'Connor, an Olympic gold medalist with the U.S. Equestrian Federation.",
      "\"The commanding general gets up there and he goes, 'OK, I would like for all of you guys to realize that we do not know what we're talking about,'\" O'Connor recounted to CBS News. \"I thought it was the greatest opening line I've ever heard. That humility was surprising to me: 'We're in serious trouble. We need to really look at this whole thing.'\"",
      "According to Lt. Col. Jason Crawford, a veterinarian and the new commander of the Caisson Detachment, much of the issue centered around education.",
      "\"Once we brought the right experts in, I think everyone then starts having the aha moment,\" Crawford said. \"Like, we didn't know the horses were kind of working too much.\"",
      "Starting in June, two squads of 11 horses will perform two services a day for a total of about 10 funerals per week. Before the pause, some of the horses were working 45 days straight when they were supposed to get two weeks rest after 14 days of work.",
      "And it isn't just the welfare of the animals that is a focus, but the equipment. The old caisson weighed about 2,600 pounds. The new one is more than 1,000 pounds lighter.",
      "There has also been extensive training for unit personnel. Staff Sgt. Isaac Melton, a squad leader, told CBS News he didn't grow up riding horses, and says the first time he even came in contact with one was when he began training 15 months ago. He says that training has averaged about \"eight to 10 hours a day.\"",
      "Melton says \"perfection\" will be going through his mind on day one of the program's return.",
      "Sgt. Daimien Copeland was part of the program before it was suspended.",
      "\"Something inside your chest, let's you just feel \u2014 you're proud, you're nervous, you're excited,\" Copeland said of his feelings of resuming horse-drawn caissons. \"You know, you're honored to be able to be the one that's saying, 'I'm helping bring this back to the cemetery to those service members and their families.'\"",

    "summary": "With the 2025 hurricane season starting June 1, NOAA forecasters announced their prediction for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Ten days before start of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced their forecast for how many tropical storms and hurricanes to expect this year. The current outlook predicts a 60% chance of an \"above-normal\" hurricane season, with between 13 to 19 named storms. Six to 10 of those are expected to strengthen into hurricanes, and three to five could become major hurricanes, forecasters said.",
      "They estimated there's a 30% chance of a \"near-normal\" season and a 10% chance of a \"below-normal\" season.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, releases its seasonal hurricane outlook each spring. It incorporates research from the Climate Prediction Center, the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, all branches of the agency.",
      "Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham presented the findings during a news conference Thursday morning at the Jefferson Parish Emergency Operations Center in Gretna, Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans. They chose that location to commemorate the victims and destruction of Hurricane Katrina, 20 years after that storm devastated the area.",
      "In their remarks, Grimm and Graham each emphasized the technological developments that have allowed NOAA and the weather service to produce forecasts that are more accurate with each passing year.",
      "\"The United States is fortunate to have the worlds best scientists, meteorologists and computer modeling experts,\" said Grimm. \"These experts are constantly learning from current and past events.\"",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, there are a \"confluence of factors\" influencing the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the outlook said, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead. The agency may also release an updated hurricane forecast later in the season should their assessment change.",
      "NOAA's forecasting model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System or HAFS, is expected to undergo an upgrade that officials believe could increase the accuracy of storm tracking by about 5%.",
      "\"In my 30 years at the National Weather Service, we've never had more advanced models and warning systems in place to monitor the weather,\" said Graham in a statement. \"This outlook is a call to action: be prepared. Take proactive steps now to make a plan and gather supplies to ensure you're ready before a storm threatens.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "When researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team published their annual forecast earlier this spring, they also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",
      "Silvers and his team predicted there would be 17 named storms this season \u2014 tropical storms with sustained wind speeds of at least 39 mph. According to their forecast, nine of the storms will grow into hurricanes, with three developing into major hurricanes. That would place hurricane activity at roughly 125% of the seasonal average recorded between 1991 and 2020, according to their report.",
      "\"It's a noticeable and important difference, because it matters for people along the coastlines whenever we have an above average season,\" Silvers said at the time.",
      "The Colorado State report largely attributed the higher activity expected this year to warm sea surface temperatures, which can essentially act as fuel for storms. But the findings also pointed to \"considerable uncertainty\" as to which phase of the ENSO cycle would coincide with the coming hurricane season.",
      "El Ni\u00f1o, the warmer half of the cycle, is often linked to conditions in a section of the equatorial Pacific that disfavor hurricanes, while La Ni\u00f1a, the colder inverse, is considered more conducive to hurricane formation. La Ni\u00f1a conditions ended shortly after CSU released its hurricane forecast and returned to \"neutral,\" a state that researchers said could be favorable for hurricanes to develop in the absence of El Ni\u00f1o.",

      "The White House's \"Make America Healthy Again\" or \"MAHA\" commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has published its first report on what it says are four leading drivers of childhood chronic disease.",
      "\"The report is the product of a consensual process, and it represents a collaborative effort of all the agencies and the White House. And it represents a consensus that is probably the strongest and most radical consensus by a government agency in history about the state of America's health,\" Kennedy told reporters in a call ahead of its release.",
      "Thursday's release is the first in a process laid out by President Trump's executive order in February. By August, the commission is due to follow up with a policy strategy to address the findings raised in this report. Kennedy called the report a \"milestone.\"",
      "\"MAHA's become hot,\" Mr. Trump told a roundtable that included Kennedy and other top administration officials at the White House on Thursday.",
      "The \"chronic disease crisis\" in children is described in the report as growing rates of a number of issues including childhood obesity, diabetes, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, cancer, allergies and autoimmune disorders.",
      "\"More than 40% of American children now have at least one chronic health condition,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday. \"Since the 1970s, rates of childhood cancer have soared, in many cases, by nearly 50%. ... In the 1960s, less than 5% of the children were obese, now over 20% are obese. ... Think of this one, this is the one that gets me every time, and it seems to be getting worse \u2014 just a few decades ago, one in 10,000 children had autism. Today it's 1 in 31.\"",
      "Medical experts attribute much of the increase in autism to better and more widespread testing and diagnostics.",
      "Lee Zeldin, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that the Trump administration was not seeking \"a European, mandate-driven regulatory system that stifles growth\" as a result of the process.",
      "\"It will happen through a renewed focus on improved science throughout the federal government and our partners. And through unleashing private sector innovation to produce better solutions for our children,\" Zeldin said.",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials criticized the report, which they said misrepresented several facts and left out other well-known drivers of childhood chronic disease.",
      "\"They're looking for specific causes and silver bullets to draw attention to. However, prevention is all about making it easier for people to make healthy choices,\" said one current federal health official in a message, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "What does the MAHA report say is causing childhood chronic disease?",
      "The wide-ranging report is organized around four topics that it describes as the \"potential drivers behind the rise in childhood chronic disease that present the clearest opportunities for progress\":",
      "Poor diet, driven primarily by ultra-processed foods",
      "Cumulative exposure to chemicals like food additives and pesticides",
      "Lack of physical activity and chronic stress",
      "\"Overmedicalization\" with too many prescriptions and vaccines",
      "These largely reflect many of the themes that Kennedy has long spoken about, including as a longshot presidential candidate last year and as the head of the nation's public health agencies in recent months.",
      "\"It is very strong, it's very frank, and it is a clarion call to do something with utmost urgency to end this crisis. And that's what we wanted,\" Kennedy said of the report.",
      "For example, under the heading of ultra-processed foods, the report echoes Kennedy's criticism of the shift from using \"minimally processed animal-based sources like butter and lard\" to seed oils like corn and canola. And it takes aim at the federal dietary guidelines process, which is due to release a major update later this year.",
      "Others reflect past Kennedy priorities that stop short of his previous calls. For example, the report criticizes the \"corporate capture of media\" through advertising campaigns paid for by drugmakers, but does not call for a ban as he did in the past, acknowledging the pharmaceutical industry \"has the First Amendment right to have these\" ads.",
      "Some parts of the report mirror public health advice championed under the Biden administration, like around the \"epidemic of loneliness and isolation,\" which then-Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned in 2023 was driven by factors like social media and technology.",
      "It also often points to other countries as examples of how things could be done better. A section criticizing U.S. school nutrition programs cites examples from France, Japan and Nordic countries that prepare meals using healthier ingredients.",
      "What does the MAHA report say about pesticides?",
      "The report warns that no \"country in the world has fully accounted for the fact that children are often exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals,\" saying that evaluations of chemicals individually may be neglecting the \"cumulative burdens\" of multiple exposures.",
      "Pesticides are named as a potential risk to be studied alongside a list that includes PFAS, microplastics, fluoride, electromagnetic radiation and chemicals used to make plastics.",
      "\"For example, a selection of research studies on a herbicide (glyphosate) have noted a range of possible health effects, ranging from reproductive and developmental disorders as well as cancers, liver inflammation and metabolic disturbances,\" the report says.",
      "Kennedy has previously spoken out vocally against glyphosate, dating back to court battles with the manufacturer of the Roundup pesticide made from the chemical. That had worried some Republicans and the agriculture industry ahead of the report's release.",
      "The report says that an updated government assessment of common herbicides will be released in 2026 and criticizes pesticide manufacturers for having \"spent billions on research initiatives\" that may have biased studies on the topic.",
      "But the report also pledges to support U.S. farmers, acknowledging that \"precipitous changes in agriculture practices could have an adverse impact\" on the food supply and says that past federal reviews of herbicides \"did not establish a direct link\" to bad health outcomes.",
      "\"We know that the American food system is the safest in the world. It is the safest, most reliable, most robust in the world. But now we talk about how to make it even better and healthier,\" said Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.",
      "The National Corn Growers Association said it was \"deeply troubled\" by the report, saying it was \"filled with fear-based rather than science-based information about pesticides\" like atrazine and glyphosate that have been vetted by the EPA.",
      "\"If the administration's goal is to bring more efficiency to government, then why is the secretary of Health and Human Services duplicating efforts by raising questions about pesticides that have been answered repeatedly through research and reviews by federal regulatory bodies,\" the group said in a statement after the report's release.",
      "What does the MAHA report say about vaccines and medications?",
      "The report lists a number of medications that it says raise \"important questions\" about its long-term impact for use on children. The list includes antidepressants, stimulant medications for ADHD, weight loss drugs, antibiotics and acid suppressants.",
      "\"Increasingly common, these popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs with complicated metabolic effects lack neurodevelopmental and other long term safety data, raising the specter of unforeseen problems that interrupt, damage, or impair metabolism and growth development,\" the report says of GLP-1 agonist medications.",
      "It calls out the \"growth of the childhood vaccine schedule,\" which Kennedy has long denounced, often with misleading claims about how vaccines were not sufficiently vetted for safety and efficacy.",
      "\"The number of vaccinations on the American vaccine schedule exceeds the number of vaccinations on many European schedules, including Denmark, which has nearly half as many,\" the report says.",
      "The report also reiterates Kennedy's criticism of the CDC's vaccine safety monitoring efforts, like in the Vaccines Adverse Event Reporting System and Vaccine Safety Datalink, as well as the federal approach to compensating childhood vaccine injury.",
      "It also criticizes groups like the American Medical Association for efforts to address disinformation about vaccines, saying it \"undermines the open dialogue essential to protecting and improving children's health.\"",
      "Kennedy's approach to vaccines has put him at odds with groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics, which has urged him to do more to foster confidence in the \"rigorous safety system\" for vaccines needed to protect children.",
      "\"FDA and the CDC work together to ensure that years of vaccine clinical trials and safety studies are exhaustively examined, with rigorous, respected, and accepted scientific evidence,\" the group said in a letter in March.",
      "What does the MAHA report get wrong?",
      "Multiple current and former federal health officials raised a number of issues with the report, which they said misstated several facts and left out already well-documented drivers known to be causing chronic disease in children that health authorities are already working to address.",
      "Those efforts, they warned, such as work to avert lead poisoning in children, are now under-resourced in the wake of massive layoffs and further proposed budget cuts.",
      "\"This document makes it seem like we don't know what makes people sick,\" one federal health official said in a message, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Two officials pointed out maternal health and preterm birth was left out of the report, which is known to lead to a number of health problems and can be prevented through steps like quitting smoking, avoiding alcohol and getting early prenatal care. Smoking, and the need for broader efforts to prevent youth use of nicotine products, was also not mentioned in the report.",
      "Multiple officials said that scientific research and federal data had been selectively misrepresented in the report.",
      "One official pointed out that what the report highlights as a dramatic rise in childhood cancer ignores improvements in early diagnosis driving the higher rates, as well as declines in deaths.",
      "Another section of the report criticizes the federal dietary guidelines for focusing on limiting sodium instead of focusing on minimizing ultra-processed foods, which a former top FDA official said was \"very puzzling.\"",
      "\"Reducing sodium in the diet is likely the most impactful step they could take to reduce chronic disease risk, and they ignore the totality of the science, including large randomized trials of salt interventions and salt substitutes, that demonstrate important reductions in chronic diseases,\" Dr. Susan Mayne, the FDA's former top nutrition official, said in an email.",

      "But like in Harrison's video \u2014 which features an eye cream containing vitamin C that Drunk Elephant recommends those 12 and under avoid \u2014 many of those social media posts advertise products not suitable for such young skin. (Harrison did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.)",
      "CBS News Confirmed analyzed more than a dozen popular TikTok accounts featuring skincare-obsessed teens and tweens and found that many featured products with anti-aging ingredients that, according to dermatologists, can be harmful to young skin. Often, those were promotions done in partnership with brands.",
      "Nielsen data show that households with children 12 and under spent $2.4 billion in 2023 on skincare and makeup \u2014 more than households with teens.",
      "Dr. Smita Awasthi, director of pediatric dermatology at U.C. Davis Health, said certain skincare products are meant to peel the skin, but removing the outer layer of a child's skin can lead to painful rashes and increased risk of sunburns. While she does prescribe retinoids for acne treatment to children in some rare cases, she stresses there is a stark difference between over-the-counter retinoid acne treatments and the retinol used in cosmetics.",
      "\"When I'm prescribing a retinoid, I know the concentration, and I know exactly what it is and how it's going to work,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Cosmetic retinol products include different ingredients which she said can lead to increased risk of irritation and adverse reactions in young skin.",
      "Packaging for over-the-counter acne retinoids clearly identify that it is an acne treatment, she said. But many popular skincare products that contain retinols and other harsh anti-aging ingredients don't clearly identify what they are intended for or that the ingredients can be harmful to young skin.",
      "Kierstyn McBrayer, a 22-year-old content creator who focuses on makeup and skincare, told CBS News her audience is mostly tweens. Her 16-year-old sister first got into skincare about three years ago, she said, and was using products with retinol and vitamin C until she realized they weren't good for her skin. Other viewers have told her they were doing the same until they learned what was harming their skin.",
      "\"A lot of the problem is just kids watching adults doing skincare content, and I know a lot of these adults are probably not purposely aiming their content at children, but it's kind of hard because it's like [in the] past few years, skincare content has been considered heavily by children,\" she said.",
      "In California, lawmakers are considering a bill that would make it illegal to sell certain anti-aging cosmetics to children under 18 years old. The bill was defeated last year and reintroduced in the current legislative session.",
      "But while the proposed law would target retailers, brands could continue to use social media and kid-friendly branding and packaging to market their products to children.",
      "A CBS News review of 240 recent skincare posts from a dozen popular teen influencers on TikTok showed only 15 videos, or just 6% of posts, were tagged as promotional content.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission requires that online influencers disclose when they have a \"material connection\" to a brand, including being paid or receiving free products. The agency's website specifies the disclosure should not be mixed in with a group of hashtags or links.",
      "TikTok instructs creators to turn on the \"content disclosure setting\" when promoting a brand or product; this would add a label to the video that clearly states the footage is \"promotional content\" or a \"paid partnership.\" If the setting is not enabled, TikTok could remove or restrict the video.",
      "Embreigh Courtlyn, 15, often posts \"get ready with me\" TikToks \u2014 chatty, casual videos showing people doing skincare or makeup or getting dressed. In one video, she holds up two face masks from the Korean skincare brand I Dew Care, saying, \"It's my favorite face mask ever.\" At the bottom of the video is a small label that reads \"paid partnership.\"",
      "Courtlyn's manager told CBS News, \"For any brand deal she accepts, she either enables the paid partnership tab or includes #[brand]partner in the caption to ensure compliance with FTC guidelines.\"",
      "Sometimes TikTokers signal promos to their audience in less obvious ways, such as putting #ad or #partner in the caption.",
      "Mar Taylor, a 17-year-old with more than 270,000 TikTok followers, said the skincare brands he's worked with have instructed him on how to stylize and label the footage. Taylor used the hashtag \"glowpartner\" in a TikTok advertising Glow Recipe's new toner. Taylor also said brands can give influencers a custom discount code to share with their audience, and the influencers receive a cut of the money when people use the code.",
      "McBrayer said sometimes brands will ask her not to label her collaboration videos with #ad. Instead, they ask to be referred to as \"partners.\"",
      "She said this may be because videos with #ad don't perform as well, something she has noticed in her own TikTok content.",
      "This means that whether content creators intend to or not, they're advertising products to children who may not realize they're being marketed to.",
      "\"We know that developmentally, they don't recognize ads at the same level that adults do,\" said Drew Cingel, an associate professor at U.C. Davis who studies the intersection of adolescents, psychology and social media marketing. \"And it becomes much more blurred in a social media environment.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many tweens that I've spoken to that say, when I grow up, I want to be an influencer,\" he added. \"If they see a teenage influencer getting these products, getting likes and getting all of the social gratification and money, that's what they're going to want to do.\"",
      "As the skincare trend among tweens has grown, some brands launched counter-marketing campaigns to tell kids they don't need elaborate skincare routines. Dove launched a campaign called \"Face of 10\" where dermatologists post videos aiming to inform kids about appropriate skincare. On Instagram, Kiehl's posted an image of a young boy in the sand labeled \"the only exfoliating kids should do,\" and a young girl in a ballet class labeled \"the only 10-step routine kids should learn.\"",
      "At the same time, many skincare brands feature kid-friendly packaging and marketing. While Drunk Elephant advertises \"skincare smoothies,\" Glow Recipe sells a $76 \"glow essentials kit\" in a box made to look like a pink locker and labeled \"back to school.\" The set contains a watermelon toner and strawberry primer with beta hydroxy acid and a lip balm with hyaluronic acid, all ingredients dermatologists say tweens should avoid.",
      "Drunk Elephant and Glow Recipe did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "\"How do you get a child's attention amid all these other products in a store?\" Cingel said. \"You put fruits, you put things that are cute on it, you put bright colors, we know that those things draw and hold children's attention.\"",

    "summary": "Emails show Kent pressed senior intelligence analysts to amend assessment of links between Venezuelan government and Tren de Aragua gang.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to head the National Counterterrorism Center is under fresh scrutiny as emails show he pressed senior intelligence analysts to amend an assessment of links between the Venezuelan government and the criminal gang, Tren de Aragua, known as TDA, to align the assessment more closely with Trump administration policies and to include references critical of Biden-era immigration programs.",
      "Emails obtained by CBS News show Joe Kent, who currently serves as chief of staff to Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, asked for a \"re writing\" of a memorandum on the topic authored by the National Intelligence Council, a team of experts within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that produces high-level analytic assessments for use by policymakers.",
      "After CBS contacted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence for comment, a spokesperson offered to share a selection of Kent's declassified, partially redacted email exchanges if they were published in their entirety. The ODNI file was labeled, \"Approved for public release by ODNI on 16 May 2025.\" It is not clear how exhaustive or reflective of the entirety of deliberations about the assessment the email selection released by ODNI is.",
      "Read the email exchanges released by the ODNI here:\u00a0ODNI file 1\u00a0and ODNI file 2.",
      "On Thursday, Kent also personally posted a statement on X defending his actions, writing, \"I'm honored to do my part.\"",
      "The final memorandum, dated April 7, asserts that the Maduro regime in Venezuela \"probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States.\" The assessment was later declassified and publicly released on May 5, following a Freedom of Information Act request by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.",
      "The question of whether Venezuela's government controls TDA has been at the center of judicial disputes surrounding the Trump administration's ability to deport suspected gang members under the seldom used Alien Enemies Act of 1798. President Trump invoked the act in a March proclamation, effectively designating suspected gang members as wartime enemies of the U.S. government.",
      "Soon after the proclamation was signed, the administration used the act to remove 137 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "\"I have been meaning to come chat with you about the attached TDA document, before we publish this in the PDB or as a wire product we need to do some re writing a little more analysis so this document is not used against the DNI or POTUS,\" Kent wrote on April 3, using abbreviations to refer to the director of national intelligence, President's Daily Brief and President Trump. \"Wire product\" likely refers to a secure communications and information-exchange platform used across the U.S. intelligence community.",
      "In the April 3 email, Kent criticized the draft memorandum from the IC \u2014 the intelligence community \u2014 for leading with \"weak IC speak that basically says we can't prove via smoking gun intel that the Ven gov is directing TDA, making it sound like the Ven gov has nothing to do with TDA,\" according to its text. He later added, \"Another major issue I have with the analysis in this piece is its lack of context about the status of our border and immigration policy over the last 4 years.\"",
      "\"I understand some may view this as political but it is not, it's a simple verifiable reality that we cannot overlook,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Going forward, we need to implement the changes above and incorporate the FBI's assessment of TDA's relationship with the Ven gov upfront, then go into the rest of the document,\" Kent wrote.",
      "The FBI's view, which appears on page 2 of the final memorandum, notes the bureau's analysts \"agree\" with the intelligence community's broader assessment that the Maduro government is not directing TDA movement but assess \"some Venezuelan government officials facilitate TDA members' migration from Venezuela\" with the goal of destabilizing the U.S. and other governments.",
      "The intelligence community assessment notes \"most of the IC judges that intelligence indicating that regime leaders are directing or enabling TDA migration to the United States is not credible.\" Another more heavily redacted section describes intelligence community reporting that suggests a link between TDA and some Venezuelan officials as \"limited.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who previously served as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday he believed the intelligence community was \"wrong\" in its assessment that the Venezuelan government does not control TDA and that he agreed \"100% with the FBI's finding.\"",
      "While it is not uncommon for analysts' views to be challenged and tested by officials within the chain of command, edits are usually sought to make assessments more reflective of existing data and evidence, and to do so irrespective of government policy, current and former intelligence officials said.",
      "Policymakers are also not bound by what intelligence assessments may find, the officials said, but collection and analysis happen in order to provide officials with an optimal operating picture.",
      "It is not entirely clear from the email exchanges obtained by CBS News and final version of the memorandum how many changes to the text were made at Kent's request.",
      "In a subsequent set of email exchanges on April 4, Kent offered suggestions to replace language in the memorandum about TDA migration trends, arguing that policies under the Biden administration were a key influencing factor.",
      "\"Lets go with something like this,\" Kent wrote, adding as a proposed edit, \"The IC also recognizes that between January 2021 and January 2025 the United States immigration policies and border security posture made migration from Venezuela to the United States so easy that the Government of Venezuela did not need to push migrants to the United States, United States immigrations [sic] policy served as its own pulling factor.\"",
      "Kent later approved another suggested revision that read, \"Increased flow of irregular migration from Venezuelan nationals-including some TDA members\u2014could be attributed to a wide perception of lax U.S. immigration policies and a lack of screening at the border between 2021 and 2025.\"",
      "\"This looks great,\" Kent responded.",
      "The language that appears in the final assessment, however, is different, suggesting there was additional deliberation before it was finalized: \"The IC also recognizes the regime appreciates migration as a safety valve, allowing discontented Venezuelans to leave. US border encounters of Venezuelan national [sic] have decreased since January because of migrant perceptions of new US enforcement policies.\"",
      "The New York Times and Reuters first reported the existence and some of the content of Kent's emails.",
      "Gabbard has since fired the NIC acting chair, Michael Collins, and his deputy, Maria Langan-Riekof, both of whom were among email recipients discussing the memorandum.",
      "\"These Biden holdovers were dismissed because they politicized intelligence,\" Kent's deputy, Alexa Henning, later\u00a0said on X.",
      "A former Green Beret, CIA officer, and Republican congressional hopeful, Kent has been a close ally of Gabbard, who personally endorsed his previous political runs. President Trump nominated Kent to head the National Counterterrorism Center, a prominent office within ODNI and a role that requires Senate confirmation, in February.",
      "On Wednesday, the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees raised alarm about Kent's apparent attempt to align an intelligence assessment with existing government policy and said consideration of his nomination for NCTC director should pause.",
      "\"This was a blatant attempt to politicize national security to appease a president who has repeatedly shown contempt for facts and for the intelligence professionals sworn to defend this country,\" committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner of Virginia said in a statement on Wednesday, adding the Senate should \"immediately halt consideration\" of Mr. Kent's nomination to lead NCTC.",
      "House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes of Connecticut said, \"Seeking to strongarm analysts to suit the agenda of the President, and punishing them when they refuse to bend, is a road to national security disaster\u2014and yet that is precisely the road that this Administration has chosen.\"",
      "\"The Senate must not confirm Mr. Kent as Director of the National Counterterrorism Center without a full understanding of his actions,\" Himes said."

      "The victims\u00a0have been identified as Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim. Law enforcement officials described the attack as \"targeted\" and said the\u00a0suspect shouted \"Free Palestine\" as he was being detained. The shooting was being investigated as a hate crime, a law enforcement source said.",
      "Milgrim was from Kansas. Lischinsky was an Israeli citizen, former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Mike Herzog said. Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the U.S., told reporters they were on the verge of getting engaged.",
      "\"The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,\" Leiter said. \"They were a beautiful couple who came to enjoy an evening in Washington's cultural center.\"",
      "Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said the shooting was reported at 9:08 p.m. local time and occurred outside the museum, which is located near an FBI field office and is in the heart of the U.S. capital. Responding officers found the victims with gunshot wounds, unconscious and not breathing, the D.C. Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department told CBS News.",
      "FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino\u00a0said on social media\u00a0the suspect was interviewed at approximately 1 a.m. but Bongino didn't provide any details, citing the pending investigation.",
      "\"Early indicators are that this is an act of targeted violence,\" Bongino said in an earlier post. He also called the attack \"an act of terror.\"",
      "The suspect, identified as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez of Chicago, was initially \"observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum\" before he approached a group of four people, \"produced a handgun,\" and shot the two victims, Smith said at a late-night news conference.",
      "The suspect entered the museum immediately following the shooting and was arrested by museum security, the police chief reported. \"The suspect identified where he discarded the weapon, and that weapon has been recovered,\" Smith said, adding that he \"implied that he committed the offense.\"",
      "A woman who\u00a0encountered the suspect after the shooting said he reached into his bag, pulled out a keffiyeh and said, \"I did it. I did it for Gaza,\" before he shouted, \"Free Palestine.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi told reporters Thursday that the suspect was believed to have acted alone. She said he will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.",
      "\"Our Jewish community must feel safe,\" Bondi said. \"What we saw last night was disgusting. I saw a young man's body being taken away who was about to get engaged. He had an entire life in front of him, and that was taken away.\"",
      "The suspect was charged\u00a0with two counts of first-degree murder, murder of foreign officials, causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. All are felonies, and the murder charges carry up to life in prison or the death sentence, if he is convicted.",
      "CBS News identified an account on social platform X that belongs to the suspect and has a history of posts about pro-Palestinian activism and frustration with media coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, as well as inflammatory posts about Israel and a discussion of violence for political gain.",
      "Rodriguez didn't pop up on an initial search of crime databases and wasn't on the radar of law enforcement agencies, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. The police and the FBI were combing through his social media, and electronic devices belonging to the suspect have been seized, a law enforcement source said.\u00a0A large law enforcement presence blocked off roads in Chicago's Albany Park neighborhood Thursday as officers executed a search believed to be connected to the shooting,\u00a0CBS News Chicago reported.",
      "In\u00a0a post on social media, the Israeli Foreign Ministry called the shooting a \"brutal terrorist attack.\"",
      "Robert Milgrim said that his daughter started working for the embassy in November 2023 after earning a bachelor's degree at Kansas University and two master's degrees, one at American University in Washington, D.C., and the other at the United Nations for Peace University in Costa Rica. Her degrees focused on international studies and policy, Robert Milgrim said. She had been hired at the Israeli Embassy before the\u00a0Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack\u00a0that left 1,200 Israelis dead and touched off the war in Gaza, he said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump is \"saddened and outraged\" over the deaths of Lischinsky and Milgrim, and the Justice Department will be prosecuting their killer \"to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the U.S., said he spoke to Mr. Trump by phone following the shooting, as did Bondi, who attended the news conference and earlier said that she responded to the scene of the shooting.",
      "\"I spoke to the president of the United States multiple times tonight,\" Bondi said. \"On behalf of the president, his prayers are with all of us, all of the Jewish community, all of us in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Mr. Trump later wrote on Truth Social: \"These horrible D.C. killings, based obviously on antisemitism, must end, NOW! Hatred and Radicalism have no place in the USA. Condolences to the families of the victims. So sad that such things as this can happen!  God Bless You ALL!\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that he's \"shocked\" by the \"horrific, antisemitic\" shooting. He said he instructed Israeli missions around the world to beef up security.",
      "\"We are witnessing the terrible price of anti-Semitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel,\" Netanyahu continued.",
      "In a statement, Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the shooting a \"despicable act of hatred, of antisemitism,\" adding, \"America and Israel will stand united in defense of our people and our shared values. Terror and hate will not break us.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 17:38:25 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration on Thursday moved to terminate a 1997 settlement known as the Flores Agreement, which established protections for migrant children.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Thursday moved to terminate a longstanding court settlement that has obligated the U.S. government for nearly three decades to provide basic rights and services to migrant children in its custody.",
      "Since 1997, the settlement, known as the Flores Agreement, has required federal U.S. immigration officials to hold migrant children in facilities that are safe and sanitary; provide them access to lawyers; and seek their expeditious release from government custody.",
      "The legal agreement has also allowed lawyers to inspect detention facilities holding migrant minors, to determine whether conditions are adequate for children and that the government is complying with the provisions of the court settlement.",
      "While the settlement initially largely only applied to unaccompanied minors, in 2015, U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee extended the protections to migrant children detained with their parents, generally limiting the detention of such minors to 20 days. The Obama administration fought that ruling, as it sought to deter migrant families crossing the southern border illegally by detaining them while their asylum cases were decided.",
      "In a filing on Thursday, the Justice Department told Gee, who is based in Los Angeles, that the Flores settlement should be \"completely\" terminated. It argued the agreement has hamstrung the executive branch from effectively setting immigration policy and incentivized illegal border crossings by migrant families and unaccompanied minors.",
      "\"After 40 years of litigation and 28 years of judicial control over a critical element of U.S. immigration policy by one district court located more than 100 miles from any international border, it is time for this case to end,\" the Justice Department said in its filing.",
      "The Justice Department also argued that, through laws and government regulations, the government has codified some of the provisions of the Flores agreement.",
      "Thursday's move was not entirely surprising. The first Trump administration also tried to terminate the Flores agreement, making similar legal and political arguments against the settlement. But its efforts were blocked by Gee, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2009, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "The Justice Department on Thursday also asked Gee to lift a ruling that blocked the Department of Homeland Security from enforcing a 2019 regulation that would have allowed the government to detain migrant families indefinitely, bypassing her 20-day limit.",
      "The Trump administration's bid will be challenged by the attorneys representing migrant children covered by the Flores agreement, which they say is critical to ensuring those minors are treated humanely while in U.S. care.",
      "\"Eliminating the Settlement's core protections would hand the government unchecked power to imprison children indefinitely in secret facilities \u2014 places with no standards, no transparency, and no accountability,\" said Mishan Wroe, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department said last month that it would be reinstating student visa records for more than 4,700 students.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday blocked federal immigration officials with the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students while a legal battle moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who sits on the U.S. district court in Oakland, California, found that a group of foreign nationals who are in the country on F-1 student visas but had their legal status terminated were likely to succeed in a challenge to the Trump administration's actions.",
      "White said in a 21-page decision that federal immigration officials don't suggest that the plaintiffs pose an immediate threat to safety or national security. But the students, he wrote, will \"continue to suffer significant hardship\" because of the administration's actions, absent judicial relief.",
      "White, nominated by President George W. Bush, wrote that the relief provided to the plaintiffs gives them a \"measure of stability and certainty that they will be able to continue their studies or their employment without the threat of re-termination hanging over their heads.\"",
      "His nationwide injunction blocks immigration authorities from arresting or jailing the plaintiffs in the case or those who are similarly situated until the dispute is resolved, and from transferring them outside of the jurisdiction where they live. White's order also bars the Trump administration from reversing its reinstatement of certain international students' legal status.",
      "The cases were brought by foreign nationals who were admitted to the U.S. through the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which Immigrations and Customs Enforcement oversees. The plaintiffs were in the country on F-1 visas, and records relating to their immigration status are housed in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, a database that tracks international students' compliance with their visa status.",
      "But in early April, the plaintiffs and thousands of other international students in the U.S. on F-1 visas learned that their SEVIS records had been terminated as part of the Trump administration's \"Student Criminal Alien Initiative\" for \"otherwise failing to maintain status.\"",
      "They said that terminating their SEVIS record effectively terminates their F-1 status, which governs whether they're in the U.S. lawfully. The plaintiffs said they were told their legal status had been terminated because they were \"identified in a criminal records check and/or has had their visa revoked.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who filed their lawsuit against the Trump administration last month, argued that while they each have had some contact with law enforcement, none has a criminal history that would pose a threat\u00a0to their legal status in the U.S. or render them deportable.",
      "After the international students filed their lawsuit against federal immigration authorities, a federal judge granted temporary restraining orders, which White later extended. Then, a Justice Department lawyer said that ICE had started reinstating SEVIS records for more than 4,700 students who had their student visa records terminated.",
      "But White said those changes weren't enough, and warned that the Trump administration's actions since the cases were filed \"raise the concern that they may be trying to place any future SEVIS terminations beyond judicial review.\"",
      "\"At each turn in this and similar litigation across the nation, defendants have abruptly changed course to satisfy courts' expressed concerns. It is unclear how this game of whack-a-mole will end unless defendants are enjoined from skirting their own mandatory regulations,\" he wrote.",
      "White's order came after he held a hearing on motions for preliminary injunctions last week and learned during the proceedings that ICE had been restoring SEVIS records retroactively and that the administration planned to send letters to all student visa-holders impacted by the mass cancellations.",
      "Still, he granted their requests for the injunction and rejected the Trump administration's argument that a SEVIS record is not tied to immigration status, calling it \"unpersuasive and unsupported.\"",
      "\"By terminating plaintiffs' SEVIS records, defendants altered plaintiffs' legal status within the United States,\" White wrote.",
      "He also chided the Trump administration's so-called \"Student Criminal Alien Initiative,\" and said that it underscored the need for nationwide relief.",
      "\"That initiative is a uniform policy that uniformly wreaked havoc not only on the lives of plaintiffs here but on similarly situated F-1 nonimmigrants across the United States and continues do so,\" White wrote.",

      "The penny, which dates from the early days of the U.S. Mint after its establishment in 1792, now costs more to manufacture than the coin is worth. The 1-cent coin cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute in 2024, according to the U.S. Mint's 2024\u00a0annual report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House narrowly passed President Trump's domestic policy bill Thursday following a dramatic all-night session and days of negotiations.",
      "In a 215 to 214 vote, all but two House Republicans supported the massive budget package \u2014 the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda \u2014 in a vote that came hours after unveiling an updated version of the legislation that GOP leaders hoped would satisfy enough holdouts. GOP Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio opposed the bill. House Freedom Caucus chairman Andy Harris of Maryland voted present.",
      "The measure cleared a critical procedural hurdle in the wee hours of the morning, teeing up the vote on final passage after days of consternation among the House Republican conference.",
      "The bill will now go to the Senate, where some Republicans have already voiced some opposition.",
      "\"We look forward to the Senate's timely consideration of this once-in-a-generation legislation,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said after the vote Thursday, pledging to get the package to the president's desk in the coming weeks. \"We're going to get it there by Independence Day on July 4, and we are going to celebrate a new golden age in America.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt posted on social media that the bill's passage \"would not have happened without President Trump's leadership.\"",
      "The legislation, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, addresses the president's tax, defense and energy priorities, and has overcome several setbacks since the beginning of the year after GOP leadership made repeated assurances to holdouts that their concerns would be addressed later if they kept the legislation moving forward.",
      "But as Johnson's self-imposed deadline to get the measure across the finish line in the House by Memorial Day quickly approached, the Louisiana Republican was facing increasing opposition from several factions of his party to parts of the bill involving Medicaid, the state and local tax deduction and other provisions.",
      "A 42-page manager's amendment released by House GOP leaders late Wednesday included changes to win over both the budget hardliners in the House Freedom Caucus and blue-state Republicans pressing to ease the tax burden on their constituents. The new version would, among other things, move up the implementation of Medicaid work requirements from the beginning of 2029 to the end of 2026, a change sought by hardliners.",
      "Another change to the bill would more quickly end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "Johnson could only afford three defections on the bill, with all members present and voting, given his slim majority. Massie was the sole Republican to oppose the key procedural vote on the measure earlier Thursday.",
      "\"If something is beautiful, you don't do it after midnight,\" Massie said on the House floor.",
      "Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, delivered his final pitch to House Republicans ahead of the vote, urging that the bill will deliver on GOP promises.",
      "\"If you vote no, you're voting against American energy, you're voting against securing America's border, you're voting against helping those middle class families,\" Scalise said.",
      "Johnson touted the legislation on the House floor, saying it \"gets Americans back to winning again.\"",
      "\"This one big beautiful bill is the most consequential legislation that any, any party has passed, certainly under a majority this thin,\" the speaker said.",
      "All Democrats opposed the package. And after House Democrats threw up procedural roadblocks overnight to delay a vote on the measure, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries railed against the bill in a speech from the House floor early Thursday, calling it a \"reckless, regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam.\"",
      "\"This is one big, ugly bill that House Republicans are trying to jam down the throats of the American people under the cover of darkness,\" Jeffries said.",
      "The New York Democrat, alluding to the midterm elections next year, warned that \"this day might very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.\"",
      "The vote came after right-wing holdouts met Wednesday afternoon with Mr. Trump and Johnson at the White House. After the meeting, Johnson huddled with other members of the Republican conference to brief them on the changes while House Freedom Caucus members met separately.",
      "Before the White House meeting Wednesday, Harris, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, said he wasn't optimistic the bill could pass this week, though he was \"pretty confident\" it could be passed within 10 days.",
      "But other budget hardliners said after the meeting that negotiations were headed in the right direction.",
      "During a visit to the Capitol Tuesday, Mr. Trump pressured Republicans to fall in line behind the legislation and suggested that those who don't could face primary challenges.",
      "In a statement of administrative policy issued Wednesday, the White House Office of Management and Budget urged House Republicans to pass the measure, saying it \"reflects the shared priorities of both Congress and the Administration,\" adding, \"failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal.\"",
      "The details of the updated version of the legislation came together in the final hours before the vote.",
      "Johnson also negotiated with Republicans from blue states over a provision on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The moderates advocated for an increase to the SALT cap, currently set at $10,000, but argued that the $30,000 cap outlined in the package remained too low. An agreement was reached to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, according to the managers amendment.",
      "The vote marks a key victory for Johnson, after days of shepherding his conference through difficult disagreement over the legislation. But even with the victory, the legislation is expected to face resistance in the Senate \u2014 where numerous Republicans have said they'll seek changes to the bill.",
      "Johnson met with Senate Republicans to discuss the budget process Tuesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, told reporters Wednesday that the speaker would \"like to see as little change to the product as possible, because they cobble together a very delicate balance over there.\" But Thune said \"the Senate will have its imprint on it.\"",

      "Lischinsky was an Israeli and German dual national. He \"spoke fondly of growing up\" in Bavaria, a region of southern Germany, and was \"very much in love with his childhood home\" there, said Lore Herzog, who had known Lischinsky since 2018. He came from a large family, Herzog said.",
      "\"He loved them all dearly and spoke about them all the time,\" Herzog said. Herzog remembered Lischinsky as a \"very morally upright person with a very strong sense of justice.\" The two met while living in Jerusalem.",
      "\"Yaron was super cheerful and seemed to really love everything he did,\" said Herzog, who now lives in Amsterdam. \"It was his dream to work in politics and international relations.\"",
      "Israeli diplomat Ron Prosor told The Asssociated Press said that Lischinsky was a student of his at an Israeli university.",
      "Lischinsky was Christian, Prosor said, and a \"a true lover of Israel\" who had served in the military \"and chose to dedicate his life to the state of Israel.\"",
      "On his LinkedIn profile, Lischinsky said he advocated for interfaith dialogue and intercultural understanding. He said that he was an \"ardent believer\" in deepening Israel's ties with the Arab world through the U.S.-brokered agreements known as the Abraham Accords, the AP reported.",
      "Suspect in custody",
      "Elias Rodriguez has been named as a suspect in the shooting and is currently in custody, officials said. He was charged on Thursday\u00a0with two counts of first-degree murder, murder of foreign officials, causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. All are felonies, and the murder charges carry up to life in prison or the death sentence, if he is convicted.",
      "Rodriguez, a 30-year-old from Chicago, was initially \"observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum\" before he approached a group of four people, \"produced a handgun,\" and shot Lischinsky and Milgrim, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela A. Smith said in a news briefing.",

      "Rodriguez also \"chanted 'free, free Palestine,' while in custody,\" Smith said.",

    "summary": "North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un said a new naval destroyer was damaged in a \"serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness.\"",
    "story": [
      "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un vented fury at his own military and other officials Wednesday after his country's second naval destroyer was damaged in a failed launch that he was there to witness, state media reported Thursday. Kim wants bigger warships to deal with what he calls escalating U.S.-led threats against his country, amid a long-simmering standoff over his nuclear weapons.",
      "It is uncommon for North Korea to acknowledge military-related setbacks or accidents, and observers say the disclosure of the failed ship launch suggests Kim is serious about his naval advancement program and confident of ultimately achieving that objective.",
      "During a launching event at the northeastern port of Chongjin on Wednesday, the newly built 5,000-ton-class destroyer became unbalanced and was punctured in its bottom sections after a transport cradle on the stern section slid off first and became stuck, according to the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency. KCNA didn't provide details on what caused the problem, the severity of the damage or whether anyone was injured.",
      "According to KCNA, Kim, who was present at the ceremony, blamed military officials, scientists and shipyard operators for a \"serious accident and criminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism.\" Kim called for a ruling Workers' Party meeting slated for late June to address their \"irresponsible errors.\"",
      "\"It's a shameful thing. But the reason why North Korea disclosed the incident is it wants to show it's speeding up the modernization of its navy forces and expresses its confidence that it can eventually build\" a greater navy, said Moon Keun-sik, a navy expert who teaches at Seoul's Hanyang University.",
      "Moon suspected the incident likely happened because North Korean workers aren't yet familiar with such a large warship and were rushed to put it in the water.",
      "The damaged vessel was likely the same class as the country's first destroyer unveiled last month, which experts assessed as North Korea's largest and most advanced warship to date. Kim called the first vessel, named Choe Hyon \u2014 a famed Korean guerilla fighter during the Japanese colonial period \u2014 a significant asset for advancing his goal of expanding the military's operational range and nuclear strike capabilities.",
      "State media described that ship as designed to carry weapons systems including nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. Kim said the ship was expected to enter active duty early next year and later supervised test-firings of missiles from the warship.",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Thursday that the damaged vessel was likely equipped with similar systems and remains toppled over in the sea. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC appeared to show the vessel rolled onto its side, positioned diagonally from the dock, with most of its hull submerged and draped in blue covers.",
      "Earlier commercial satellite images indicated that the country was building its second destroyer at a shipyard in Chongjin.",
      "Beyond Parallel, a website run by the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the satellite imagery of Chongjin's Hambuk shipyard on May 12 showed that a second vessel in the Choe Hyon-class of guided missile destroyers was under construction.",
      "A report by the North Korea-focused 38 North website assessed last week that the destroyer in Chongjin was being prepared to be launched sideways from the quay, a method that has been rarely used in North Korea. The report said the previous destroyer launched at the western shipyard of Nampo, in contrast, used a floating dry dock.",
      "South Korean officials and experts say the Choe Hyon destroyer was likely built with Russian assistance as the two countries' military partnerships are booming. North Korea has provided Russia's Vladimir Putin with equipment and even soldiers to aid in his ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine.",
      "While North Korea's naval forces are considered far inferior to those of its rivals, analysts say the destroyer with nuclear-capable missiles and an advanced radar system would still enhance the North's offensive and defensive capabilities.",
      "Kim has framed the arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the United States and South Korea, which have been expanding joint military exercises in response to the North's advancing nuclear program. In April, the U.S. military flew long-range B-1B bombers over the Korean Peninsula in joint exercise with the South, in a show of force against North Korea days after Kim's powerful sister vowed to resist a U.S.-led push to eliminate the Pyongyang's nuclear program",
      "He says the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening the North Korean navy.",
      "Hours after releasing the report on the damaged destroyer, North Korea test-fired multiple cruise missiles from an area about 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Chongjin, according to South Korea's military. The launches were a continuation of a streak of weapons-testing activities by North Korea in recent years. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the launches were being analyzed by South Korean and U.S. intelligence authorities.",

      "Jenin, West Bank\u00a0\u2014 Several nations that have backed Israel during its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip voiced outrage Wednesday after Israeli troops fired what they called \"warning shots\" as foreign diplomats visited the occupied West Bank.",
      "The Palestinian Authority, which partially administers the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory, accused Israeli troops of \"deliberately\" shooting at the delegation near the flashpoint city of Jenin. The Israeli military, already under pressure over its tactics in the Gaza war, said it regretted the \"inconvenience.\"",
      "AFP video from Jenin \u2014 a frequent target of Israeli military raids \u2014 showed the delegation and accompanying journalists running for cover as shots were heard on Wednesday.",
      "A European diplomat said the envoys went to the area to see the destruction caused in the West Bank by Israeli military raids during the Gaza war, which was sparked by the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said the diplomatic convoy had strayed from the approved route and entered a restricted zone, prompting troops to fire \"warning shots\" to steer the group away. The IDF added that no one was wounded and it expressed regret for the \"inconvenience caused.\"",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' spokesman called the incident \"unacceptable.\"",
      "\"Diplomats who are doing their work should never be shot at, attacked in any way, shape or form.

      "Britain's minister for the Middle East and North Africa, Hamish Falconer, said Wednesday that he'd spoken directly with U.K. diplomats affected by the incident, and he called for an investigation.",

I have spoken to our diplomats who were affected,\" he said in a social media post. \"Civilians must always be protected, and diplomats allowed to do their jobs. There must be a full investigation and those responsible should be held accountable.\"",
      "\"The Japanese government has protested to the Israeli side and requested an explanation and the prevention of a recurrence,\" government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said in Tokyo, confirming that diplomatic staff from the country had taken part in the delegation.",
      "Israel-Europe ties increasingly strained over Gaza, D.C. murders",
      "The incident came as anger mounted over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Palestinians are scrambling for basic supplies after weeks of near-total isolation. A two-month Israeli aid blockade on Gaza was partially eased this week, but not enough to alleviate the hunger crisis facing the enclave's roughly 2 million inhabitants, according to the U.N. and humanitarian agencies.",

    "story": [
      "Refugee admissions to the United States have all but ground to a halt \u2014 except for one group, or a \"small subset,\" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them on Tuesday: Afrikaners. They are members of the White ethnic minority that once led South Africa's brutal, four-decade apartheid regime, which ended in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president.",
      "The Trump administration has already welcomed the first group of Afrikaner asylum applicants, who were given expedited refugee status after claiming they were the victims of violence and discrimination in South Africa.",
      "Other Afrikaners are waiting, keen to take advantage of the offer of special treatment from the Trump administration to gain protected status and the right to live and work in the U.S.",
      "Those hopefuls have been meeting to share information on the process, including Dolf Grobler, who has already applied. The professional hunter told CBS News he has $2.5 million to help make America great again.",
      "\"I'm worried that the genocide, which is currently mainly focused on White farmers, is going to spread,\" he said. The claim of a White genocide is one that President Trump's adviser Elon Musk, whose family are Afrikaners, has backed.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday as the U.S. leader hosted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa for an official visit. The Afrikaner refugee program was a topic of discussion, along with trade and other matters. In the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted.",
      "\"Those people in many cases, are being executed, being executed, and they happen to be White, and most happen to be farmers,\" Mr. Trump said, calling the situation \"sort of the opposite of apartheid.\"",
      "\"People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people,\" Ramaphosa said.",
      "According to South African police, in the last three months of 2024, 12 people were murdered on farms there; one was a White farmer, while the others were Black laborers or security workers.  Asked if he believed life for him and his family was better under apartheid \u2014 an overtly racist minority-rule system that denied equal rights to South Africa's vast majority Black population \u2014 Grobler didn't hesitate.",
      "\"Yes,\" he told CBS News. \"I can't say in my heart that we are better off now.\" Although he did concede apartheid was wrong.",
      "Claims of a White genocide are often circulated by right-wing groups, but the view is not held widely within the Afrikaner community.",
      "Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, an academic at North-West University in South Africa, says the claims are simply untrue.",
      "\"There's no sign of it, never has been. In fact, Whites are economically the strongest group\" in South Africa, Croucamp told CBS News. \"64% of all boardrooms in South Africa are still White. The average incomes of White South Africans are vastly higher than Black South Africans ... they have better schools, they have better education, private health care. This is the land of milk and honey if you're White.\"",
      "Croucamp suspects the South African government's strong stance against Israel's actions in Gaza, and its relations with China, could have played some part in Mr. Trump's decision to embrace the controversial amnesty program for Afrikaners, but he believes there's more to it.",
      "\"In South Africa, right-wing groups, so-called civil society groups, we know that they have access to the Trump administration because they claim that. And just over the last few days, they have, several times, they said that they will speak to the American government, as if they have access to them. And if you listen to what Trump has said, it corresponds exactly with the genocide narrative that they sell and that they market,\" Croucamp said. \"So, I'm afraid I have to believe them when they say they have direct access to the Trump administration, and we see what Trump has been doing.\"",
      "Grilled about the refugee program Tuesday on Capitol Hill, in a testy exchange with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Secretary of State Rubio insisted that U.S. foreign policy \"doesn't require even-handedness, it involves prioritizing the interests of the United States. ... The United States has a right to pick and choose who they allow into the United States.\"",
      "White South Africans make up only about 7% of the country's population, but they still own more than half of all its farmland. And while the country has a staggeringly high crime rate, racial motives are not generally a factor, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein.",
      "He acknowledged that violent attacks on farmers do occur, especially in agricultural land near big cities, where there are often large, impoverished populations, but he said overall, \"I feel safe. I sleep with my doors open here on the farm.\"",
      "There have also been allegations that White farmers are the victims of land expropriation, with the government seizing farms without providing compensation. In January, Ramaphosa signed into law measures to expropriate mostly unused land for public use,  which his government said was necessary to address the consequences of decades of apartheid. While the law provides for fair compensation in most cases, it also allows for expropriation without compensation under limited  circumstances. And any measures can be challenged in court.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued that it unfairly targets White landowners, though the law does not mention the race of anyone who could be affected under the legislation.",
      "And more importantly, there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended.",
      "Serfontein argues the problem isn't a deliberate effort by the government to seize White-owned land without compensation, but rather \"because of a dysfunctional government. The model is wrong.\"",
      "He said that for decades, land has been handed over to a Black population with compensation for former owners under established rules, but without any support for the new owners. So, almost a decade ago, Serfontein helped to launch a project aimed at training new Black farmers to work the land.",
      "To date, he says he's personally helped train more than 700 young Black farmers \u2014 the country's next generation of agricultural workers.",
      "\"I'm extremely positive, and so are the young people, the young farmers, they are positive,\" he said.",
      "As for a white genocide, he agreed with Croucamp, saying bluntly: \"It's not happening.\"",
      "Serfontein said he didn't know the histories of the Afrikaners who had already left for the U.S., and he didn't doubt they \"probably had some unhappy experiences in South Africa, about a number of things. But let me tell you that if you went to NAMPO last week \u2014 NAMPO is the biggest agricultural show in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 you would have found a vibe there between the farmers, young farmers, old farmers, Black farmers, White farmers, that you've never experienced before. They are so excited about the future of South Africa.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who pushed back on claims about White genocide in South Africa.",
    "story": [
      "Differences between President Trump and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa came to a head Wednesday afternoon in a tense exchange in the Oval Office, as Mr. Trump confronted him over whether White genocide is taking place in South Africa.",
      "Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa met for a critical conversation \u2014 with South African-born billionaire Elon Musk in the room \u2014 amid tensions between the U.S. and South Africa, after the U.S.\u00a0accepted\u00a059 White Afrikaners last week and granted them status as refugees.",
      "At one point in the meeting, Ramaphosa took a question intended for Mr. Trump about what it would take to persuade him that White genocide is not occurring in South Africa.",
      "\"It will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends, like those who are here,\" responded Ramaphosa, who brought South African golfers Ernie Els and Retief Goosen and billionaire businessman Johann Rupert with him to the White House. \"When we have talks between us at a quiet table, it will take President Trump to listen to them. I will not be repeating what I've been saying.\"",
      "Mr. Trump responded that there are \"thousands of stories\" and \"documentaries\" about the situation in South Africa, before directing his staff to dim the lights in the Oval Office and play a video for everyone in the room about allegations of violence against White South Africans.",
      "The president said white crosses seen in the video showed burial sites of White farmers. In fact, they were part of a\u00a0protest, filmed near Normandien, South Africa, on Sept. 5, 2020, after the killing of Glen and Vida Rafferty, a White farming couple. Participants\u00a0said\u00a0the demonstration aimed to draw attention to all farm murders in the region, not solely those involving White farmers. Elon Musk previously shared the same video on X, posting it on\u00a0March 8\u00a0and\u00a0May 13\u00a0with the claim that the crosses represented White farmers.",
      "The video also included footage of a crowd at a rally being led in a chant against White farmers. After the video concluded, Mr. Trump and Ramaphosa went back and forth about the situation.",
      "Ramaphosa said he hadn't seen the videos the president's staff played and said the videos do not represent government policy. He said he and his party are \"completely opposed\" to the language used in the footage.",
      "\"We have dead White people, dead White farmers, mostly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Others in the South African delegation who accompanied Ramaphosa told Mr. Trump the issue is not White genocide in South Africa, but rather, crime in general, affecting South Africans across demographics. Ramaphosa, too, pushed back.",
      "\"There is criminality in our country,\" he said. \"People who do get killed unfortunately through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people.\"",
      "The Trump-Ramaphosa meeting, in which reporters were allowed in the room for over an hour, is yet another instance of the U.S. president inviting the media to witness and broadcast testy exchanges with other world leaders, instead of keeping those discussions behind closed doors.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said White farmers in South Africa have been targets of \"genocide\" \u2014 an allegation South Africa and Ramaphosa have rejected \u2014 and insists South Africa is \"out of control,\" echoing Musk. In the meeting Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"Elon wanted\" the Afrikaners to be allowed into the U.S. as refugees. During the time reporters were in the Oval Office for the meeting, Musk said nothing.",
      "The beginning of the Oval Office meeting was smoother. Mr. Trump called it a \"great honor\" to be with the South African president, who, he said \"is certainly in some circles, really respected, other circles, a little bit less respected, like all of us, in all fairness.\"",
      "\"We are essentially here to reset the relationship between the United States and South Africa,\" Ramaphosa said in his opening comments.",
      "Asked by a reporter why the government is letting White Afrikaners into the U.S. while denying entry to other refugees, the president began by lambasting the news outlet that asked the question.",
      "\"We've had tremendous complaints about Africa, about other countries too, from people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They said there's a lot of very bad things going on in Africa, and that's what we're going to be discussing today.\"",
      "\"We have many people that feel they're being persecuted,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of 12 official languages of South Africa.",
      "The expedited process for the Afrikaners comes as the Trump administration is working to suspend the refugee admission program, drawing multiple court challenges.",
      "In a tense exchange during a hearing on Capitol Hill Tuesday on budget matters, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio if the Afrikaners are more persecuted than the Uyghurs or Rohingyas, or dissidents in Cuba, Venezuela or Nicaragua, or than those who would be threatened by the Taliban, should they return to Afghanistan.",
      "Kaine suggested the Trump administration is giving preference to Afrikaners due to the color of their skin, and asked Rubio why the U.S. should prioritize Afrikaners. Rubio said the Afrikaners are a \"small subset.\"",
      "\"It's a new issue,\" Rubio said. \"And the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that's different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet.\"",
      "\"Let me challenge you, and I'm just going to say for the public, if you want to understand about the quote, persecution, of Afrikaner farmers, go look at the composition of the South African government,\" Kaine responded. \"Since July of 2024, there's a government of national unity. And the opposition party today \u2014 the ANC \u2014 the Afrikaner Party, the Democracy Alliance, is part of the governing coalition. They joined the governing coalition a year ago, and the leader of that party was given the remit of Agriculture Minister Jan Steenhuisen, and he is the leader of the former Afrikaner party, still widely representing Afrikaners. He is the minister of agriculture in South Africa right now. I assert that this claim that there's persecution of Afrikaner farmers is completely specious.\"",

    "summary": "The Defense Department says it has accepted a Boeing jet\u200b from Qatar that will be retrofitted and used to transport President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Defense Department said Wednesday it has accepted a Boeing jet from Qatar that will be retrofitted and used to transport President Trump.",
      "Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth accepted the Boeing 747 \"in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.\"",
      "\"The Department of Defense will work to ensure proper security measures and functional-mission requirements are considered for an aircraft used to transport the President of the United States,\" Parnell said.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the Pentagon had accepted the jetliner from the government of Qatar.",
      "\"As directed by the Secretary of Defense, the Air Force is preparing to award a contract to modify a Boeing 747 aircraft for executive airlift. Details related to the contract are classified,\" a spokesperson for the Air Force said in a statement.",
      "Hegseth's acceptance of the plane comes days after sources confirmed to CBS News that the Qatari royal family would be donating aircraft for Mr. Trump's use. The gift was first reported by ABC News. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet will be donated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library just before he leaves office.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters last week that the Qataris are \"giving us a gift\" and lamented that the current plane used for Air Force One is nearly four decades old. When the president is aboard either of the two Boeing aircrafts that are part of the presidential air transport fleet, its call sign is \"Air Force One,\" according to the Air Force.",
      "\"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Now I could be a stupid person and say, oh no, we don't want a free plane.\"",
      "The president has continued to defend the notion of receiving the plane from Qatar, writing on social media that the Boeing jet is being given to the Defense Department, and is a gift that will be used as a \"temporary Air Force One\" until new Boeing planes arrive.",
      "\"Why should our military, and therefore our taxpayers, be forced to pay hundreds of millions of Dollars when they can get it for FREE from a\u00a0 country that wants to reward us for a job well done. This big savings will be spent, instead, to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Only a FOOL would not accept this gift on behalf of our Country,\" he wrote last week.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also reiterated Monday that the plane is a donation to the nation and the Air Force.",
      "\"The government of Qatar, Qatari family, has offered to donate this plane to the United States Air Force, where that donation will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations,\" she said. \"It will be retrofitted to the highest of standards by the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force. This plane is not a personal donation or a gift to the president of the United States.\"",
      "Still, news of the gift raised concerns among members of Congress and questions of whether the transaction complied with federal ethics rules.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York sent a letter last week to three internal government watchdogs asking them to conduct an ethics review of the gift and issue an advisory opinion on whether it violates federal ethics regulations and the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts from foreign nations.",
      "\"The American presidency is not a personal inheritance. It does not exist to enrich Donald Trump,\" he wrote. \"It belongs to 'We the People.' If we fail to draw the line here, there may soon be no line left to draw.\"",
      "Some Republicans, too, have expressed unease with the gift from the Qatari government. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that there are \"lots of issues associated with that offer,\" which he said should be discussed further.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said that while he understands the need for a new Air Force One, \"I'd love to have a big, beautiful jet that's built in the United States of America.\" Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina warned \"everybody needs to know that Air Force One is not like every other Boeing.\"",
      "\"It's going to have to be put through a lot of paces and probably every square inch analyzed before I think the president should consider it as a primary means of transportation,\" he said.",
      "The secretary of the Air Force, Troy Meink, who was only confirmed last week, told Congress on Tuesday that the Air Force had already started looking into what modifications would be required to retrofit the jet.",
      "\"The secretary of defense has directed the Air Force to basically start planning to modify the aircraft. We are postured to do that,\" Meink told Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, who asked about the potential security concerns of such a transfer.",
      "Meink said turning any civilian aircraft to Air Force One standards \"will take significant modifications.\"",

      "It's difficult to pinpoint how many missing U.S. soldiers were killed in Italy\u00a0during World War II, but roughly 72,000 American servicemembers remain unaccounted for from the war around the world, according to DPAA. The remains of nearly 1,000 Americans who died in World War II have been identified since recovery efforts were renewed in the 1970s.",
      "Forensic experts at DPAA spend years using DNA, dental records, sinus records and chest X-rays to identify the remains of service members killed in combat.",

    "story": [
      "A pro-Russian former politician from Ukraine was fatally shot Wednesday morning outside his children's school in the Spanish capital Madrid, according to the Reuters news agency and multiple Spanish outlets. Andriy Portnov was killed outside the American School of Madrid by an unidentified gunman or gunmen, according to the reports.",
      "\"Several persons shot him in the back and the head and then fled toward a forested area,\" Reuters quoted an unnamed source at the Spanish Interior Ministry as saying.",
      "There was no immediate confirmation of the slain man's identity by Spain's National Police or other authorities, and no indication of a motive or any suspects who might have been identified. Witnesses told Spanish media that at least one possible suspect was seen running into a nearby wooded area.",
      "According to Spain's El Diario newspaper, citing witnesses, Portnov was shot right after dropping off his children at the American School. Photos from the scene showed a man's body lying motionless on the ground behind a Mercedes sedan.",
      "Portnov was a senior aid to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, a pro-Russian leader who was ousted during the Euromaidan Revolution in 2014. That ouster brought Ukraine's current, Western-backed government to power, and it infuriated Russia, which launched its first, initial invasion of Ukrainian territory that same year, quickly culminating in the unilateral annexation of Crimea.",
      "Portnov was a lawyer, and his political opponents in Ukraine had accused him of helping build a legal framework to enable the former government in Kyiv to crack down on protesters during the 2014 pro-democracy uprising.",
      "Portnov continued living in Ukraine after the 2014 revolution, despite his close ties with the Yanukovich administration, until he left the country in 2022, according to the Radio Freedom Ukraine network.",
      "In 2021, Portnov was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department under the Magnitsky Act, an American law designed to target foreign individuals implicated in corruption and human rights abuses.",
      "The U.S. government accused him of having \"cultivated extensive connections to Ukraine's judicial and law enforcement apparatus through bribery,\" and said he had been \"credibly accused of using his influence to buy access and decisions in Ukraine's courts and undermining reform efforts.\"",
      "\"As of 2019, Portnov took steps to control the Ukrainian judiciary, influence associated legislation, sought to place loyal officials in senior judiciary positions, and purchase court decisions,\" the Treasury said.",

      "Late that same year, a series of letter bomb attacks targeted high-profile institutions including the Ukrainian and U.S. embassies in Madrid and the Spanish Defense Ministry.

    "summary": "Trump's plans to build a \"Golden Dome\" U.S. missile defense system undermine \"global strategic balance and stability,\" and should be abandoned, China says.",
    "story": [
      "China said Wednesday that the Trump administration's plan to construct a so-called \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system to protect the U.S. from missile attacks carries \"strong offensive implications\" and will increase the risks of a global arms race and militarizing outer space. President Trump said Tuesday that his administration had \"officially selected an architecture for this state-of-the-art system,\" and that a budget package currently being deliberated by Congress would provide an initial $25 billion in funding for the project.",
      "An unclassified assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency shows the military expects to be contending with missile threats that are greater in \"scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" noting specifically that \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses.\"",
      "\"North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability,\" the DIA assessment said, warning that already, \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\"",
      "But China, which has been deepening its ties with Russia while rapidly developing its missile and other military capabilities, including its nuclear weapons, accused the Trump administration of obsessing over U.S. defense at the risk of endangering global security.",
      "\"The United States, in pursuing a 'U.S.-first' policy, is obsessed with seeking absolute security for itself. This violates the principle that the security of all countries should not be compromised and undermines global strategic balance and stability. China is seriously concerned about this,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Wednesday during a regular briefing in Beijing, according to multiple international news agencies.",
      "The White House plan \"heightens the risk of space becoming a battlefield, fuels an arms race, and undermines international security,\" she said. \"We urge the United States to abandon the development and deployment of a global missile defense system as soon as possible.\"",
      "The U.S. military has said for years that China and Russia are already deploying weapons in space, with reports suggesting everything from laser weapons to Chinese satellites with the ability to disable or even capture American satellites. Last year, the U.S. warned Russia against deploying a\u00a0nuclear-capable anti-satellite weapon that analysts believe could loiter in space for long periods of time before emitting a burst that would disable all satellites around it.",
      "In Russia's capital, meanwhile, the Kremlin said Wednesday that Mr. Trump's plans would require consultations between Moscow and Washington, but a spokesperson said it was largely a \"sovereign matter\" for the U.S.",
      "It was a softer stance than taken previously by the regime of President Vladimir Putin, which had recently published a statement saying the new American missile defense system would explicitly give Moscow an impetus \"for a significant strengthening of the arsenal for conducting combat operations in space.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, as he made his announcement, that he'd not yet spoken with Putin about his plans, but he said he would, \"at the right time.\"",
      "China and Russia, in a joint statement issued earlier in the month, called the Golden Dome project, \"deeply destabilizing in nature,\" and the two U.S. adversaries said it would turn space into \"an arena for armed confrontation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV called Wednesday for sufficient humanitarian aid to be allowed into war-ravaged Gaza, where humanitarian agencies say a total blockade has sparked critical food and medicine shortages. Israel has, under massive pressure from the U.S. and other allies, started to allow more aid into Gaza this week, but it has not eased its military operations, and aid agencies say the amount of humanitarian goods entering the strip is nowhere near enough to meet the urgent needs of a battered civilian population.",
      "The United Nations announced Monday that it had been cleared to send in aid for the first time since Israel imposed a total blockade on March 2, sparking severe shortages of food and medicine.",
      "\"The situation in the Gaza Strip is worrying and painful,\" the pope said during his first weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square. \"I renew my heartfelt appeal to allow the entry of sufficient humanitarian aid and to put an end to the hostilities, the heartbreaking price of which is paid by children, the elderly, the sick.\"",
      "Leo, who was elected on May 8 to be the Catholic Church's first U.S. pope, has made peace an early theme of his papacy, calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "The Israeli army has stepped up its offensive in Gaza in recent days, with the enclave's Hamas-run Ministry of Health saying some 600 people have been killed over the last week alone. Israel says both the restrictions on aid and the stepped-up military campaign are aimed at pressuring Hamas \u2014 long designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. and Israel \u2014 to release the remaining 58 hostages held in Gaza and to accept a ceasefire on Israeli terms.",
      "Israel has vowed to carry on with its war until the hostages, about 20 of whom are believed to be alive, are free, Hamas is defeated and disarmed and its leaders are sent into exile. The war was sparked by the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, which killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 taken as hostages into Gaza.",
      "The health ministry, which does not differentiate between combatant and civilian casualties, says more than 53,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's retaliatory war, many of them women and children.",
      "Charity calls Israeli easing of Gaza blockade \"a smokescreen\"",
      "The amount of aid Israel has started to allow into war-ravaged Gaza is not nearly enough and is \"a smokescreen to pretend the siege is over,\" the MSF aid group said Wednesday.",
      "\"The Israeli authorities' decision to allow a ridiculously inadequate amount of aid into Gaza after months of an air-tight siege signals their intention to avoid the accusation of starving people in Gaza, while in fact keeping them barely surviving,\" said Pascale Coissard, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) emergency coordinator in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. \"The current authorization for 100 [trucks] per day, when the situation is so dire, is woefully inadequate.\"",
      "\"Meanwhile, evacuation orders are continuing to uproot the population, while Israeli forces are still subjecting health facilities to intensive attacks,\" Coissard said.",
      "Israel said 93 trucks had entered Gaza from Israel on Tuesday, but the United Nations said the aid had been held up.",
      "Asked Tuesday about Israel's latest moves, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in Washington that the Trump administration had been \"pleased to see that aid is starting to flow in again.'",
      "\"I understand your point that it's not in sufficient amounts,\" he told a journalist. \"But we were pleased to see that decision was made. I understand another 100 trucks are behind that and maybe more in the next few days.\"",
      "Rubio said the U.S. was working with the U.N.'s World Food Program \"to walk through some of the ideas and plans they had for distribution\" of aid inside Gaza, but he stressed that in the administration's view, \"ultimately the answer here is for this [war] to end, hopefully with the elimination of Hamas, because the people of Gaza deserve a more prosperous, peaceful future, which they will never have as long as Hamas exists.\"",

    "summary": "Israel lets limited aid into Gaza, easing its blockade as Netanyahu says his allies can't tolerate \"images of mass famine\" in the war-torn Palestinian territory.",
    "story": [
      "A soaring death toll in the Gaza Strip and an increasingly vocal outcry over near-famine conditions in the Palestinian territory are piling pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept a negotiated ceasefire with Hamas and drop his country's near-total blockade of the enclave. Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said Tuesday that at least 87 people were killed by Israeli military strikes over the last 24 hours alone.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces have ramped up operations in Gaza over the last week, killing hundreds of people, many of them women and children, in what Netanyahu's government insists is legitimate self-defense and aimed entirely at securing the return of 58 hostages still held by Hamas and its allies in Gaza, and destroying the group. Israel blames Hamas \u2014 long designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and the European Union \u2014 for all casualties in Gaza, accusing the group of operating in and around civilian infrastructure.",
      "On Monday, for the first time in two and a half months, Netanyahu permitted a handful of trucks carrying aid to enter Gaza. He said he had been pressured into easing the total blockade by allies who could not tolerate \"images of mass famine.\"",
      "There were unconfirmed reports on Tuesday that as many as 100 trucks had been allowed to cross the Gaza border. But the United Nations' World Food Program said this week that a few trucks would be just a drop in the bucket given the vast and urgent need for food in Gaza, where more than 2 million Palestinians have been trapped for more than two years of blistering war.",
      "Thousands of trucks have been lined up for weeks just across the Gaza border, waiting to cross in. No food, fresh water or medicine had entered the territory for nearly 80 days under the Israeli blockade. Hunger is so rife that full-blown famine is once again stalking Gaza's population, according to the WFP's director for the Palestinian territories, Antoine Renard, who's just returned from the enclave.",
      "\"You have around an estimated 14,000 children that I know are facing what we call severe acute malnutrition,\" he told CBS News on Monday, meaning those children could die without rapid intervention. \"We always wait for when 'famine' is on. But when famine is on, it's already too late. That will be a failure of all the international community.\"",
      "Until this week, Israel's government had insisted there were no food shortages in Gaza. But for the first time, in a message posted Monday on social media, Netanyahu acknowledged that Gaza is nearing a hunger crisis.",
      "\"Our best friends in the world, senators that I know as enthusiastic Israel supporters, who I know for many years, are come to me and telling me, 'we give you all the support for a final victory \u2014 arms, support on your maneuvers to destroy Hamas, support at the U.N. Security Council. There is one thing we cannot endure \u2014 pictures of mass famine. This is something we are unable to witness. We will not be able to support you.'\"",
      "As a result of that pressure, he's allowing the limited amount of aid into Gaza.",
      "Renard said the WFP had sufficient food on standby, ready to enter, to feed the entire population of Gaza for a month.",
      "\"It must stop,\" he said of the Israeli blockade. \"The civilian population shouldn't be trapped. There's no reason, actually, to hold them accountable for what they are not part of.\"",
      "Netanyahu did not name any of the nations exerting pressure on his government to ease the blockade, and while Israel's closest and most vital ally the U.S. was almost certainly the country he referred to when mentioning long-friendly senators, it's not just the U.S. calling for a resolution to the crisis \u2014 and other countries have been doing so more assertively.",
      "In a strongly worded statement published Monday, the leaders of the U.K., France and Canada called the level of human suffering in Gaza intolerable, and they threatened to take action.",
      "\"The Israeli Government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable and risks breaching International Humanitarian Law,\" the countries said in a joint statement. \"We oppose any attempt to expand settlements in the West Bank ... We will not hesitate to take further action, including targeted sanctions.\"",
      "Netanyahu decried the threat, saying in a statement that by \"asking Israel to end a defensive war for our survival before Hamas terrorists on our border are destroyed and by demanding a Palestinian state, the leaders in London, Ottowa and Paris are offering a huge prize for the genocidal attack on Israel on October 7 while inviting more such atrocities.\"",
      "\"The war can end tomorrow if the remaining hostages are released, Hamas lays down its arms, its murderous leaders are exiled and Gaza is demilitarized,\" said the Israeli leader. \"No nation can be expected to accept anything less and Israel certainly won't. This is a war of civilization over barbarism. Israel will continue to defend itself by just means until total victory is achieved.\"",
      "Israel has escalated its war with a new offensive that has killed nearly 600 people over the last week, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.",
      "Doctors are running out of supplies \u2014 barely able to treat malnourished children, let alone the hundreds of people injured by the Israeli strikes who stream in day after day.",
      "The war in Gaza was sparked by the Hamas-led terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and left 251 others as hostages in Gaza. Israel's retaliatory war has destroyed large swaths of Gaza, displaced 90% of its population \u2014 most of them multiple times \u2014 and killed more than 53,500 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",

    "summary": "Tigers, monkeys, jaguars, elephants and lions are among the animals being moved due to the cartel violence\u200b eclipsing the northern Mexican city of Culiacan.",
    "story": [
      "A pack of veterinarians clambered over hefty metal crates on Tuesday morning, loading them one by one onto a fleet of semi-trucks. Among the cargo: tigers, monkeys, jaguars, elephants and lions \u2014 all fleeing the latest wave of cartel violence eclipsing the northern Mexican city of Culiacan.",
      "For years, exotic pets of cartel members and circus animals have been living in a small animal refuge on the outskirts of Sinaloa's capital. However, a bloody power struggle erupted last year between rival Sinaloa cartel factions, plunging the region into unprecedented violence and leaving the leaders of the Ostok Sanctuary reeling from armed attacks, constant death threats and a cutoff from essential supplies needed to keep their 700 animals alive.",
      "The aid organization is now leaving Culiacan and transporting the animals hours across the state in hopes that they'll escape the brunt of the violence. But fighting has grown so widespread in the region that many fear it will inevitably catch up.",
      "\"We've never seen violence this extreme,\" said Ernesto Zazueta, president of the Ostok Sanctuary. \"We're worried for the animals that come here to have a better future.\"",
      "Violence in the city exploded eight months ago when two rival Sinaloa Cartel factions began warring for territory after the dramatic kidnapping of Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada, the leader of one of the groups, by a son of notorious capo Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n who then delivered him to U.S. authorities via a private plane.",
      "Zambada and \"El Chapo's\" son Joaquin Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez were arrested when they landed in Texas.",
      "Since then, intense fighting between the heavily armed factions has become the new normal for civilians in Culiacan, a city that for years avoided the worst of Mexico's violence in large part because the Sinaloa Cartel maintained such complete control.",
      "\"With the escalating war between the two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel, they have begun to extort, kidnap and rob cars because they need funds to finance their war,\" said security analyst David Saucedo. \"And the civilians in Culiacan are the ones that suffer.\"",
      "Animals scared by cartel fighting",
      "Zazueta, the sanctuary director, said their flight from the city is another sign of just how far the warfare has seeped into daily life.",
      "This week, refuge staff loaded up roaring animals onto a convoy as some trainers attempted to sooth the animals. One murmured in a soft voice as he fed a bag of carrots to an elephant in a shipping container, \"I'm going to be right here, no one will do anything to you.\"",
      "Veterinarians and animals, accompanied by the Mexican National Guard, began traveling along the freeway to seaside Mazatlan, where they planned to release the animals into another wildlife reserve.",
      "The relocation came after months of planning and training the animals, a move made by the organization in an act of desperation. They said the sanctuary was caught in the crossfire of the warfare because of its proximity to the town of Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda, a stronghold of Los Chapitos, one of the warring factions.",
      "During intense periods of violence, staff at the sanctuary can hear gunshots echoing nearby, the roar of cars and helicopters overhead, something they say scares the animals. Cartel fighting regularly blocks staff off from reaching the sanctuary, and some animals have gone days without eating. Many have started to lose fur and at least two animals have died due to the situation, Zazueta said.",
      "Complicating matters is the fact that an increasing number of the animals they rescue are former narco pets left abandoned in rural swathes of the state. In one case, a Bengal tiger was discovered chained in a plaza, caught in the center of shootouts. Urban legends circulate in Sinaloa that capos feed their enemies to pet lions. The U.S. Justice Department alleged in an indictment released in 2023 that the sons of \"El Chapo\" and their cartel associates fed some of their victims \"dead or alive to tigers.\"",
      "Diego Garc\u00eda, a refuge staff member, is among those who travel out to rescue those animals. He said he regularly receives anonymous threats, with callers claiming to know his address and how to find him. He worries he'll be targeted for taking away the former pets of capos. Zazueta said the refuge also receives calls threatening to burn the sanctuary to the ground and kill the animals if payment isn't made.",
      "\"There's no safe place left in this city these days,\" said Garc\u00eda.",
      "That's the feeling for many in the city of 1 million. When the sun rises, parents check for news of shootouts as if it were the weather, to determine if it's safe to send their kids to school. Burned houses sit riddled with bullets and occasionally bodies appear hanging from bridges outside the city. By night, Culiacan turns into a ghost town, leaving bars and clubs shuttered and many without work.",
      "\"My son, my son, I'm here. I'm not going to leave you alone,\" screamed one mother, sobbing on the side of the road and cursing officials as they inspected her son's dead body, splayed out and surrounded by bullet casings late Monday night. \"Why do the police do nothing?\" she cried out.",
      "\"What are we doing here?\"",
      "In February, while driving a refuge vehicle used for animal transport, Garc\u00eda said he was forced from the car by an armed, masked man in an SUV. At gunpoint, they stole the truck, animal medicine and tools used by the group for rescues and left him trembling on the side of the road.",
      "The breaking point for the Ostok Sanctuary came in March, when one of the two elephants in their care, Bireki, injured her foot. Veterinarians scrambled to find a specialist to treat her in Mexico, the United States and beyond. No one would brave the trip to Culiacan.",
      "\"We asked ourselves, 'what are we doing here?'\" Zazueta said. \"We can't risk this happening again. If we don't leave, who will treat them?\"",
      "The concern by many is that Mexico's crackdown on the cartels will be met with even more violent power moves by criminal organizations, as has happened in the past, said Saucedo, the security analyst.",
      "Zazueta blames local government and security forces for not doing more, and said their pleas for help in the past eight months have gone unanswered.",
      "Sinaloa's governor's office did not immediately respond to a request comment.",
      "The sanctuary made the move without any public announcement, worried that they might face repercussions from local officials or the same cartels forcing them to flee, but they hope the animals will find some relief in Mazatlan after years of conflict.",
      "Garc\u00eda, the sanctuary staff member, is not so sure. While he hopes for the best, he said he's also watched cartel violence spread like a cancer across the Latin American country. Mazatlan, too, is also facing bursts of violence, though nothing compared to the Sinaloan capital.",
      "\"It's at least more stable,\" he said. \"Because here, today, it's just suffocating.\"",
      "Cartel violence is also frequent in the central state of Guanajuato, Mexico's most deadly state. This week, gunmen opened fire and killed seven people, including some minors, in a plaza in the city of San Felipe, police said. The violent crime is believed to be linked to conflict between the Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel, one of the most powerful in Mexico.",

      "\"I'm asking Congress to fund a state-of-the-art Golden Dome shield to protect our homeland,\" the president said in his address to Congress. \"All made in the USA. Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago, but the technology wasn't there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It's incredible, actually. And other places have it. Israel has it, other places have it, and the United States should have it too.\"",
      "A new, unclassified assessment from the Pentagon's intelligence agency shows what threats the U.S. needs to defend itself from in the next decade.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency, or DIA, expects that missile threats to the U.S. will expand both in scale and sophistication, as the U.S. faces threats from foreign actors in the shape of intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, two types of hypersonic weapons, land attack cruise missiles, and fractional orbital bombardment systems.",
      "Mr. Trump wants a \"Golden Dome\" in the vein of Israel's Iron Dome, the country's mobile all-weather air defense system that has intercepted projectiles since its installation in 2011. However, Israel's Iron Dome largely defends against shorter-range threats, like rockets, while it has two other air defense systems to defend against missiles, which are increasingly being used in conflict.",
      "\"Missile threats to the U.S. homeland will expand in scale and sophistication in the coming decade,\" the assessment says. \"China and Russia are developing an array of novel delivery systems to exploit gaps in the current U.S. ballistic missile defenses, but traditional ballistic missiles \u2014 which are guided during powered flight and unguided during free flight \u2014 will remain the primary threat to the homeland. North Korea has successfully tested ballistic missiles with sufficient range to reach the entire homeland, and Iran has space launch vehicles it could use to develop a military-viable ICBM by 2035, should Tehran decide to pursue the capability.\"",
      "The assessment warns that China, Iran and North Korea will have significantly more intercontinental ballistic missiles by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing ICBMs.\" Although Iran doesn't currently have known ICBMs, the DIA assessment suggests it will have 60 by 2035. Keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear power has been a key goal of the U.S. and its allies.",
      "The assessment also warns that China's submarine-launched ballistic missiles will increase in number by 2035, and \"there is no part of the homeland which cannot be struck by existing adversary SLBMs.\" Russia, too, has submarine-launched ballistic missiles.",
      "Further, the assessment warns that both China and Russia will increase their boosted hypersonic weapons multiple times over by 2035. The report says that Russia and China can reach parts of the U.S. with these systems. The report also says China and Russia's land attack cruise missile capacity will significantly increase by 2035, and both countries have the potential to reach parts of the U.S.",
      "Finally, the report says both Russia and China are expected to have what's known as fractional orbital bombardment systems by 2035. These will be able to orbit the globe, traveling over the South Pole to avoid early detection.",

      "The announcement comes after the state's Republican Attorney General, Jason Miyares, said his office has found reasonable cause after a multi-year investigation determining that Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology (TJHSST), which is overseen by Fairfax County Public Schools (FCPS) system, operates an admissions process that discriminates against applicants of Asian heritage.",

They are sons and daughters, neighbors, classmates and Virginians who deserve equal protection and opportunity under the law.\"",
      "The controversy began in 2020 when TJHSST made changes to its admissions policies to sensibly promote diversity.

His aides side-eyed one another\u2013Donilon had worked for Biden since 1981,\" Tapper and Thompson wrote.",

      "Why are scam ads so widespread?",
      "The problem of\u00a0scam ads on Facebook has grown rapidly in recent years. Experts point to the rise of\u00a0cryptocurrency schemes,\u00a0AI-generated content and\u00a0organized criminal groups operating from Southeast Asia.

      "Staying safe online takes a little extra effort, but it's well worth it. Here are some steps you can follow to avoid falling victim to scam ads.",
      "1. Check the source and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Look for verified pages and official websites. Scammers often copy the names and logos of trusted brands, but the web address or page details may be off. Always double-check the URL for slight misspellings or extra characters and avoid clicking links in ads if you're unsure about their legitimacy.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Be skeptical of deals that seem too good to be true:\u00a0If an ad offers products at an unbelievable price or promises huge returns, pause and investigate before clicking. Scammers often use flashy discounts or urgent language to lure people in quickly. Take a moment to think before you act, and remember that if something sounds impossible, it probably is.",
      "3. Research the seller:\u00a0Search for reviews and complaints about the company or individual. If you can't find any credible information, it's best to avoid the offer. A quick online search can reveal if others have reported scams or had bad experiences, and legitimate businesses usually have a track record you can verify.",
      "4. Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0There are companies that can help remove your personal info from data brokers and people-search sites. This means less of your data floating around for scammers to find and use. While these services usually charge a fee, they can save you a lot of time and hassle compared to doing it all yourself. Over time, you might notice fewer spam calls, emails and even a lower risk of identity theft.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5. Never share sensitive information:\u00a0Don't enter your credit card or bank details on unfamiliar sites. If you're asked for personal information, double-check the legitimacy of the request. Scammers may ask for sensitive data under the guise of \"verifying your identity\" or processing a payment, but reputable companies will never ask for this through insecure channels.",
      "6. Keep your devices updated: Keeping your\u00a0software updated adds an extra layer of protection against the latest threats. Updates often include important security patches that fix vulnerabilities hackers might try to exploit. By regularly updating your devices, you help close those security gaps and keep your personal information safer from scammers and malware.",
      "7. Report suspicious ads:\u00a0If you see a scam ad on Facebook or Instagram, report it using the platform's tools. This helps alert others and puts pressure on Meta to take action. Reporting is quick and anonymous, and it plays a crucial role in helping platforms identify patterns and remove harmful content.",
      "8. Monitor your accounts:\u00a0Regularly check your bank and credit card statements for unauthorized transactions, especially after making online purchases. Early detection can help you limit the damage if your information is compromised, and most banks have fraud protection services that can assist you if you spot something suspicious.",
      "By following these steps, you can better protect yourself and your finances from online scams. Staying alert and informed is your best defense in today's digital world.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The mess with scam ads on Meta's platforms shows why it's important to look out for yourself online. Meta says it's working on the problem, but many people think it's not moving fast enough. By staying careful, questioning suspicious offers and using good security tools, you can keep yourself safer. Until the platforms step up their game, protecting yourself is the smartest move you can make.",

Also, using various email aliases makes it so you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone verification and a secondary number",
      "If a site requires phone verification, consider using a secondary number to avoid exposing your personal phone number. Services like\u00a0Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private. The process should take between five and 20 minutes for each site on your list, depending on how difficult they make it for you. But once you submit the request, removal is usually pretty quick. Your information should be off the site within 24 hours to a week, though it can sometimes take up to 30 days.",
      "Don't forget about Google search results",
      "People-search sites aren't the only places your info can pop up. Sometimes your personal info appears directly in Google search results, pulled from public records or other sites. If you find sensitive info in Google results, you can request removal through Google's own removal tools, especially if the info includes things like your Social Security number, bank account info or images you don't want to be public. This is a separate process, but it is worth doing alongside removing info from people-search sites.",

      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Keep in mind, this isn't a one-and-done deal",
      "Even after you remove your info, there's a good chance it'll show up again. People-search sites constantly scrape public records and other databases to refresh their listings. Some sites offer \"suppression lists\" you can add your name to, but it's not a perfect system. Small changes, like a slightly different address, a new phone number or a missing middle name, can slip past their filters and pop up as a \"new\" profile.",
      "The best way to stay on top of it is to set a reminder to recheck the main people-search sites every few months and repeat the opt-out process when needed. Maintaining a detailed tracker or spreadsheet with the sites you've contacted, dates and confirmation info can make this easier and help you avoid missing any sites.",

      "If you live in one of these states, you now have a much stronger legal footing to demand that people-search sites remove your information. Many of these laws require companies to honor requests to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal data, and some even require businesses to respect browser-based global opt-out signals. But even if you don't live in one of these states, you should still submit removal requests. Most people-search sites do not filter opt-out requests by state; they generally process any request they receive to avoid potential legal issues, regardless of your location.",
      "If this sounds like too much work, there's help",
      "Removing your data manually takes real time and commitment, especially since you have to keep doing it to stay off these sites. That's why many people turn to personal data removal services. Instead of going site by site yourself, a service can automatically send removal requests on your behalf, track the responses and re-request removals if your data reappears later.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Manual removal is free and gives you full control, but it takes time and requires ongoing effort. Automated services cost money but save you time, handle rechecks and can catch new listings faster. Choose what best fits your budget and privacy needs. If you follow these steps and stay consistent, you can take back control of your personal information online. It might take some work, but every removal counts toward protecting your privacy.",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reports that healthcare information of more than 430,000 Ascension patients was exposed in a data breach.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses how users can keep their genetic data safe amid DNA testing company 23andMe's bankruptcy sale.",
      "The state of cybersecurity in the healthcare industry worries me a lot. Healthcare organizations, whether nonprofit or for-profit, collect an enormous amount of data. And it's not just phone numbers, addresses or emails but also sensitive information like medical records, insurance details and more. This data is extremely valuable, which makes it a prime target for hackers.",
      "What's worse is that many healthcare institutions often neglect cybersecurity and treat it as an afterthought. In 2024 alone, an industry tracker recorded 1,160 healthcare breaches that exposed 305 million patient records. This marked a 26% increase compared to the previous year.",
      "Against this backdrop, Ascension, a Missouri-based Catholic health system with 142 hospitals and 142,000 employees, recently disclosed that a December 2024 breach exposed the personal and medical information of more than 430,000 patients.",

      "A hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "According to\u00a0Ascension's breach notification letters, the compromise began on Dec. 5, 2024, when the network learned patient data\u00a0\"may have been involved in a potential security incident.\" By Jan. 21, 2025, its investigators had determined that Ascension had \"inadvertently disclosed information to a former business partner,\" and that attackers likely stole data from that partner via a flaw in its software. In other words, patient records passed from Ascension into a third party's system and were then siphoned off by cybercriminals.",
      "The attackers gained a broad array of information. Impacted patients' demographic and financial details, names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, dates of birth, race, gender and Social Security numbers were exposed. Even more worryingly, the breach included clinical data from hospital stays, including physician names, admission and discharge dates, diagnosis and procedure codes, medical record numbers and insurance details. This is the very data that criminals can exploit for fraud or identity theft.",
      "A healthcare worker typing on a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Timeline and involvement",
      "Ascension reported the breach to regulators via an HHS filing on April 28, 2025, which shows 437,329 patients affected. By comparison, the company had earlier disclosed the impact in state filings. For example, 114,692 Texas patients and 96 Massachusetts residents were individually notified of exposure. In response, Ascension is offering those affected two years of free identity monitoring services (credit monitoring, fraud consultation and identity theft restoration).",
      "For scale, Ascension is a major nonprofit health system, one of the largest in the U.S., operating 142 hospitals across North America. The company has not named the third-party partner, but its description fits a vendor whose secure file-transfer software was breached.",
      "The timing aligns with a series of\u00a0recent Cl0p ransomware attacks. Cl0p has publicly claimed responsibility for exploiting a zero-day flaw in Cleo's secure file-transfer products, stealing data from dozens of organizations worldwide. While Ascension itself was not directly hit by ransomware, its data might have ended up in that same attack campaign.",
      "Ascension's patients and employees are no strangers to data breaches. In May 2024, a\u00a0Black Basta ransomware attack compromised Ascension's own network. That incident, traced back to a single employee opening a malicious file, resulted in the exfiltration of data belonging to nearly 5.6 million people.",
      "The fallout was severe. Hospitals lost access to digital records, forcing clinicians to record vitals, medications and orders on paper. Elective procedures and some appointments were paused, and emergency services were redirected to unaffected facilities to avoid delays in care.",

      "If you think you were affected or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the Ascension data breach.",
      "1) Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, Ascension attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Ascension breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Ascension breach, including Social Security numbers and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You might want to consider investing in identity theft protection, which can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5) Monitor your credit reports: Regularly check your credit reports through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6) Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7) Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Attackers have frequently targeted Ascension, but the company does not seem to be learning its lesson. If it were a one-off incident, it might be understandable. But how do you fail to strengthen cybersecurity after experiencing a nationwide blackout? Rather than being an isolated event, this breach feels like part of a larger pattern. The industry relies on complex vendor networks and outdated IT systems, while cybercriminals continue to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Scammers are always coming up with new tricks. Just when you start feeling confident about spotting phishing emails, suspicious links and fake banking apps, they find a new angle. Lately, they have been getting more creative, turning to the built-in features of our phones to pull off their schemes. One of the latest targets is NFC, the technology behind tap-to-pay.",
      "It might seem harmless, but a new scam is using it in ways most people would never expect. An Android malware called SuperCard goes beyond just stealing your card details. It gives attackers the ability to use your card remotely for real transactions. And the worst part is that it all begins with something as simple as a text message.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "An Android phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What makes SuperCard X different?",
      "SuperCard X stands out from other Android malware because of how it operates. As reported by\u00a0researchers at Cleafy, instead of stealing usernames, passwords or verification codes, it uses a method called NFC relay. This allows attackers to copy card data from a victim's device in real time and use it elsewhere to make payments or withdraw cash. The process does not require physical access to the card or knowledge of the PIN.",
      "The malware is offered through a Malware-as-a-Service model, which means different cybercriminals can use it in their own regions. This makes the threat more scalable and harder to contain. Unlike most banking trojans, SuperCard X is not focused on one specific institution. It targets any cardholder regardless of which bank issued their card.",
      "Another key difference is how stealthy the malware is. It uses minimal permissions and does not include extra features that would make it easier to detect. This lean approach helps it avoid detection by antivirus software and allows it to operate quietly on infected devices.",
      "SuperCardX fully undetectable (FUD | Cleafy) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "How the scam works",
      "The fraud begins with a message sent through SMS or WhatsApp. It pretends to be from a bank and warns the recipient about a suspicious transaction. The message includes a phone number and urges the person to call to resolve the issue. This is the first step in gaining the victim's trust.",
      "Once on the phone, the attacker poses as a bank representative and walks the victim through a fake security process. This may include asking them to confirm personal details or adjust settings in their mobile banking app, such as removing spending limits on their card.",
      "Next, the attacker asks the victim to install a mobile app that is described as a tool to verify the account or enhance security. In reality, this app contains the SuperCard X malware. After the installation, the attacker instructs the victim to tap their card against the phone. The malware then captures the NFC data from the card and sends it to a second phone controlled by the attacker.",
      "Using the copied data, the attacker can make contactless payments or make ATM withdrawals almost instantly. This method allows them to steal funds quickly and leaves little opportunity for banks or victims to intervene in time.",
      "A woman scrolling on her phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "8 ways you can stay safe from SuperCard X malware",
      "1) Be cautious of suspicious texts and calls. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Fraudulent campaigns often begin with an SMS or call that seems to come from your bank. These messages usually claim there's suspicious activity on your account and urge you to click a link or dial a number to resolve the issue. However, this is a tactic used to gain access to your personal information. Always approach such messages with skepticism.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Avoid installing apps from untrusted sources:\u00a0One of the key ways malware like SuperCard X spreads is through deceptive apps that victims are persuaded to install. These apps often look harmless, posing as tools for security or account verification. If you receive a link to download an app via SMS, email or messaging apps like WhatsApp, do not click on it. Instead, only download apps from trusted sources, such as the Google Play Store. Additionally, carefully review app permissions and avoid granting unnecessary access, particularly to sensitive data like NFC, location or personal contacts.",
      "3) Turn off NFC when not in use:\u00a0NFC, or Near Field Communication, is a useful feature that allows contactless payments and data exchanges. However, it can be exploited by attackers to capture your card information without you even realizing it. To minimize your risk of falling victim to NFC-based malware like SuperCard X, turn off NFC when you're not actively using it.",
      "On most Android devices, you can do this by going to \"Settings,\" then \"Connected Devices\" or \"Connection Preferences,\" where you\u2019ll find the NFC toggle. By disabling NFC, your phone won't transmit data wirelessly, which helps protect your payment card information from being stolen by nearby attackers.",
      "4) Keep a close eye on your bank accounts and cards:\u00a0If your device has come into contact with the SuperCard or anything similar, it\u2019s possible your banking details are already compromised. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to regularly check your transaction history for anything odd, like a small payment you don\u2019t remember making or a charge from a strange location could be a sign of misuse. If you spot anything suspicious, report it to your bank right away. It\u2019s also worth checking your credit reports every now and then to catch signs of identity theft before they snowball into bigger issues.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: If scammers have targeted you once, there's a higher chance they\u2019ll try again, especially if your personal details (like your phone number, address or email) are easily found online. Data removal services scan people-search sites and brokers, then request the removal of your info. This reduces your exposure and helps prevent future phishing or social engineering attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Contact your bank and freeze your cards:\u00a0If you think you\u2019ve tapped or handled a suspicious card, or if your phone acted strangely afterward, don\u2019t brush it off. Call your bank and let them know what happened. They can freeze your card to stop any unauthorized payments and issue a new one for added safety. You should also ask them to monitor your account more closely for a while. On top of that, place a fraud alert with a credit bureau so no one can easily open a new line of credit in your name.",
      "7) Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you've been targeted by a sophisticated scam like SuperCard X, there's a chance your personal information, not just your card data, may be at risk. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information, like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8) Report the scam to your national cybercrime authority: Whether or not you lost money, reporting the scam helps authorities track emerging threats and warn others. You can report such fraud to the FBI\u2019s\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center or the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission. Your report could help catch the people behind the scam or at least shut down their infrastructure.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The SuperCard X malware campaign represents a significant shift in how cybercriminals are targeting individuals and financial institutions. By exploiting NFC technology and combining it with social engineering tactics, attackers have found a way to bypass traditional fraud detection systems. What's especially concerning is how quickly these attacks unfold, making them harder to detect before the damage is done. As this threat evolves, it's important for both consumers and institutions to recognize the potential risks of these multilayered fraud strategies.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reports on China\u2019s Zhiyuan unveiling the world\u2019s first tri-ducted wearable eVTOL with hands-free control.",
      "Have you ever imagined what personal flying could look like in the near future? China's Zhiyuan Research Institute, based in Hangzhou, is bringing that vision closer to reality. They just unveiled what they're calling the world's first tri-ducted wearable electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for individual use, and their recent demo flight is already sparking curiosity about the future of personal flight.",

      "Tri-ducted wearable eVTOL for individual use (Zhiyuan Research Institute) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's so special about this flying machine?",
      "The coolest thing about this eVTOL is its tri-ducted propulsion system. That means it has three powerful propellers, one on the left, one on the right and one in the back, all working together to keep the aircraft stable and efficient. This setup isn't just for show. It actually helps the vehicle fly smoother, cut down on noise and hover more reliably. It's the first time a manned aircraft has used this kind of design, which is pretty groundbreaking.",
      "Safety is a huge focus for the Zhiyuan team. They built in a one-click separation system that lets the pilot quickly detach from the aircraft and deploy a low-altitude parachute if something goes wrong. That way, the pilot can land safely even in an emergency, which is a big comfort for anyone flying solo.",
      "Flying this thing isn't just for experts. Zhiyuan developed a ground control system that helps keep things simple. The eVTOL can hover steadily and fly on its own without the pilot having to constantly control it, and it can make quick, agile moves when needed. The controls are designed to be easy to use, so even people without much flying experience can handle them.",
      "On the power side, the team created a new propulsion system with a high thrust-to-weight ratio. They used advanced ducted motor designs to make the whole thing more efficient. Plus, the flight control system can handle turbulent weather, so the ride stays smooth even when the air gets rough.",

      "This new eVTOL is part of a much bigger trend in China. The country is working hard to grow what it calls its \"low-altitude economy,\" which includes drones, eVTOLs and other aircraft that fly below about 3,280 feet. The government has made low-altitude aviation a priority and is promising support for commercial spaceflight and next-generation air mobility technologies. Experts estimate that this industry could be worth more than $137 billion by 2030 as these aircraft find more uses in areas like logistics, tourism and public services.",

      "13. Shred sensitive documents: Shred old checks and bank statements. Don\u2019t just throw them away. Shred any documents with sensitive banking information.",
      "14. Report suspicious activity immediately: If you suspect check fraud or missing mail, report it to your bank and the\u00a0U.S. Postal Inspection Service right away.",
      "15. Use Positive Pay if you are a business:\u00a0Positive Pay is a fraud prevention service offered by most banks to business customers. It works by matching the checks you issue with the ones presented for payment. If something doesn\u2019t add up, like a changed amount or payee, the bank flags it for your review before it\u2019s processed.

      "Phoenix 1 \u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "The mission: From launch to splashdown",
      "Phoenix 1 launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, as part of the Bandwagon-3 rideshare mission. After reaching a 45-degree inclination orbit, the capsule completed one full trip around Earth. A carefully timed de-orbit maneuver then sent Phoenix 1 back toward the planet. During its descent, the capsule deployed an innovative inflatable heat shield, a technology designed by\u00a0Atmos to protect the capsule during the intense heat and friction of reentry.",
      "FIRST PRIVATE SPACEX POLAR MISSION SPLASHES DOWN NEAR CALIFORNIA",
      "As Phoenix 1 reentered Earth's atmosphere, it transmitted critical system and payload data to ground stations in South America. The capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean, about 1,240 miles off the Brazilian coast. Because of the remote landing location, recovery of the capsule was not planned. However, the mission's main objectives were met, and the data collected is now being analyzed to inform future missions.",

      "329,000 MPH NUCLEAR ROCKET LEADING THE NEXT ERA OF SPACE TRAVEL",
      "Why Phoenix 1 is a big milestone",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 establishes Atmos as the fastest-moving private space logistics company in Europe to conduct an orbital return mission. This achievement demonstrates that Europe is on the path to developing independent, sovereign return capabilities.",
      "It also shows that private industry can lead the way in building essential space infrastructure. Atmos' rapid prototyping approach allowed the team to develop, qualify and fly Phoenix 1 in less than a year. This speed is almost unheard of in the space industry and highlights the company's commitment to innovation and hands-on problem-solving. The mission also proved that multinational collaboration is possible, as teams from around Europe worked together to achieve a common goal.",

The mission also carried scientific and commercial payloads, including technology demonstrators and biological experiments from partners such as Frontier Space, Imperial College London, DLR and IDDK.",
      "Another key goal was to deploy and test the inflatable heat shield under real reentry conditions. Although some data from the final stage of descent could not be retrieved due to the splashdown location, the mission still provided valuable insights. The data received from the capsule has already contributed to the development of Phoenix 2, the next-generation capsule planned for launch in 2026.",

      "The technology: Inflatable heat shield and rapid prototyping",
      "The inflatable heat shield is a breakthrough in reentry technology. Traditional capsules rely on heavy, single-use heat shields or parachutes to survive reentry. Atmos' design is lighter, more efficient and potentially reusable, which could dramatically reduce the cost and complexity of returning cargo from space.",
      "Atmos' development philosophy is based on rapid prototyping and real-world testing. The team believes in building and testing hardware quickly, learning from each iteration and making improvements based on real data rather than relying solely on simulations. This approach allowed Phoenix 1 to go from concept to space in record time.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "The road ahead",
      "Atmos is already working on Phoenix 2, which will include its own propulsion system. This upgrade will allow the capsule to control its reentry trajectory and choose its splashdown zone, making recovery much easier and more practical. The company's vision is to create a flexible, cost-efficient and reliable logistics platform for space, supporting both commercial and institutional missions.",
      "With a payload efficiency of 1:2, Phoenix already offers the highest mass efficiency on the market. This opens new opportunities for microgravity research, in-space manufacturing and biotechnology. The technology will also support Europe's defense sector and strengthen the continent's independent space infrastructure.",
      "Phoenix 1\u00a0 (Atmos Space Cargo)",
      "What this means for you",
      "The success of Phoenix 1 is not just a technical achievement for engineers and scientists. It has the potential to assist with many aspects of everyday life. Faster and more affordable access to space means that new technologies, medicines and materials can be developed and tested in microgravity and then brought back to Earth for use.",
      "Universities, startups and small companies will have more opportunities to conduct experiments in space without the high costs and long wait times that have been barriers in the past.

      "Furious parents vented their anger at a Virginia county school board meeting on Tuesday following news that three male students are under investigation after they were recorded in a male locker room complaining about a biological female getting changed alongside them.",
      "The Loudoun County Public Schools -- which made national headlines in 2021 when a father was arrested and hauled out of a board meeting for speaking out about the sexual assault of his daughter by a trans student at a local school -- is investigating the boys for Title IX violations.",
      "The trans boy, a biological female, recorded them questioning why \"a girl\" was present, with one student expressing that he felt \"uncomfortable\" about the situation at Stone Bridge High School.",
      "Tensions flared at a school board meeting Tuesday over a policy that allows trans people to use the locker room that fits their gender. Boys who were recorded complaining are now under investigation. (Fox 5)",
      "TENSIONS FLARE AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETING AFTER TRANS ATHLETE WINS MULTIPLE TRACK EVENTS",
      "It is illegal to record inside locker rooms, but a Loudoun County Public Schools (LCPS) official confirmed to Fox 5 DC that none of the boys appeared in compromising positions in the video and, therefore, it was determined that no privacy laws were violated.",
      "Nevertheless, the boys are under investigation for allegedly violating policy 8040, a controversial guideline adopted in 2021 that permits students to use restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity rather than their biological sex.",
      "Scott Smith, the father arrested during that heated incident in 2021, took to the mic and blasted the board, accusing them of initially denying that his daughter had been raped and warning them that their policies could lead to similar consequences for other students.",
      "\"And now four years later you\u2019re doing the same damn thing,\" Smith said. \"You\u2019re victimizing innocent children over the priority of kids that don\u2019t know,\" he said before his mic appeared to be muted after his one-minute speaking slot had expired and he was told to hand step aside.",
      "CALIFORNIA TRACK MEET TURNS TO POLITICAL RALLY OVER TRANS ATHLETES AS SCHOOLS SPEAK OUT VS. STATE",
      "\"I\u2019m not done yet,\" Smith roared. \"You guys are sick and pathetic,\" he said to applause.",
      "Smith\u2019s words, and the words of some 130 parents who spoke, were not recorded on video, as the board voted last year to omit a video display during the public comment section of its board meetings.",
      "The decision was blasted by Smith at the time, who told \"America's Newsroom\" that the board was trying to shut down public dissent to their radical policies. Smith's daughter was sexually assaulted at Stone Bridge High School by a transgender student in 2021.",
      "Smith was convicted of disorderly conduct stemming from the 2021 school board meeting, but he was later pardoned by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",
      "Suzanne Satterfield also took aim at the board on Tuesday,\u00a0saying that children rely on adults to be truthful and protect them from harm.",
      "\"Every girl and boy has the right to feel secure using private spaces without being invaded by the opposite sex,\" Satterfield said. \"Every day that policy 8040 remains in play children are being lied to so that that they can be born in the wrong body can change their sex.\"",
      "A parent holds a sign reading: \"End 8040,\" pertaining to a policy that permits students to use restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity rather than their biological sex.\u00a0 (Fox 5)",
      "Speaker\u00a0Amy Paul\u00a0ripped the board and said that policy 8040 is \"insane.\"",
      "\"You all have helped facilitate this charade for long enough and it's time to put an end to the madness,\" Paul said. \"You're investigating three young men for having common sense enough to state the obvious, girls do not belong in boys locker rooms.\"",
      "WATCH: Pardoned father says he was used to \u2018silence\u2019 parents from protecting children: Scott Smith",
      "\"Please don't tell me that he or she is really a he, we're done playing that game, there is no such thing as a child born in the wrong body\u2026 You're taking kids who have serious issues and instead of trying to understand why they're rejecting their true selves, you encourage them to go down a path that could lead to irreparable harm to their bodies. It's time for you to act like the adults.\"",
      "Not everyone disagreed with policy 8040, with one female speaker saying that the policy was created with input from experts, data and community feedback to ensure that all students are safe, seen and supported. She said the uproar has conveniently come about because of the gubernatorial election later this year.",
      "\"Transgender people exist. They always have no executive order, sermon or headline or public comment can erase them,\" she said.",

      "\"We cannot, in good faith, debate policies impacting students if we deny the existence of those very students. That's not discourse. That's dehumanization. We have seen this playbook before, fear mongering, misinformation and political theater all at the expense of vulnerable children. It's happening again, just as it did four years ago.",
      "Meanwhile, Youngkin has requested the state\u2019s attorney general launch an independent investigation into how LCPS has managed the situation, according to Fox 5.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Oklahoma will not be able to launch the nation's first religious public charter school after the Supreme Court deadlocked 4-4 Thursday in a major case on the separation of church and state.",
      "The decision by the evenly divided court means a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that said the proposal to launch St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School violates both the federal Constitution and state law remains in place. St. Isidore would have operated online statewide with a remit to promote the Catholic faith.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Paul Coakley, the archbishop of Oklahoma City, and David Konderla, the bishop of Tulsa, said in a joint statement that they are \"exploring other options\" to provide an online education statewide.",
      "\"Families across the state of Oklahoma deserve the educational opportunities presented by St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School,\" they added.",
      "As there was no majority, the court did not issue a detailed written decision, and the case sets no nationwide precedent on the contentious legal question of whether religious schools must be able to participate in taxpayer-funded state charter school programs.",
      "A key factor in the outcome was that conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who would have been the deciding vote, did not participate in the case. She did not explain why, but it is most likely because of her ties with Notre Dame Law School. The law school's Religious Liberty Clinic represents the school.",
      "The one-page decision did not say how each justice voted. During oral arguments last month, most of the court's conservatives indicated support for the school while liberals expressed concern. At least one conservative is likely to have sided with the liberals, most likely Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "The court, with Barrett on board, is likely to be asked to weigh in on the issue in future cases, though none are likely to reach the justices imminently.",
      "The Oklahoma case was a victory for state Attorney General Gentner Drummond, who challenged a state board's approval of the school and found himself on the opposite side of fellow Republicans in the state who backed the idea.",
      "Drummond, who is running for governor, said in a statement that the decision was a \u201cresounding victory for religious liberty\u201d that would ensure that taxpayer money would not go toward \u201cradical Islamic schools,\" as well as the Catholic school at issue in the case.",
      "Rachel Laser, president of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, which challenged the school's approval in a separate case, also welcomed Thursday's decision.",
      "\"We will continue our efforts to protect inclusive public education. We call on this nation to recommit to church-state separation before this safeguard of democracy and freedom is further attacked,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt described the decision on X as a \"non-decision\" that did not resolve the issue.",
      "\"This is far from a settled issue,\" wrote Stitt, a Republican. \"We are going to keep fighting for parents\u2019 rights to instill their values in their children and against religious discrimination.\u201d",
      "The case highlights tensions within the Constitution's First Amendment; one provision, the Establishment Clause, prohibits state endorsement of religion or preference for one religion over another, while another, the Free Exercise Clause, bars religious discrimination.",
      "The Oklahoma Supreme Court had cited the state's interest in steering clear of Establishment Clause violations as a reason not to allow the proposal, submitted by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa,\u00a0to move forward.",
      "The state approved the proposal for St. Isidore in June 2023 despite concerns about its religious nature, prompting Drummond to sue.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court, when Barrett is participating, has a 6-3 conservative majority that often backs religious rights. In recent years, it has repeatedly strengthened the Free Exercise Clause in cases brought by conservative religious liberty activists, sometimes at the expense of the Establishment Clause. Some conservatives have long complained that the common understanding that the Establishment Clause requires strict separation of church and state is incorrect.",
      "Lawyers representing the school and the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board sought to portray the dispute as similar to a series of recent rulings in which the court said that under the Free Exercise Clause, states cannot bar religious groups from government programs that are open to everyone else.",
      "During the oral argument, Roberts pushed back, indicating that he saw the schools case as different from the previous decisions.",
      "Those cases, he said, \u201cinvolved fairly discrete state involvement\u201d compared with Oklahoma\u2019s charter school program.",
      "\u201cThis does strike me as a much more comprehensive involvement,\u201d he added.",
      "The push for religious public charter schools dovetails with the school choice movement, which supports parents using taxpayer funds to send their children to private school. Public school advocates see both efforts as broad assaults on traditional public schools.",
      "A key question left unresolved in the Oklahoma case is whether charter schools are indistinguishable from public schools, which factors in to whether they have religious rights and can bring free exercise claims in the first place.",
      "Currently, all 47 states that allow charter schools consider them to be public schools and bar religious schools from participating in their programs. As was raised during oral arguments, there is also a federal program with funds for charter schools that prevents money from going to sectarian schools.",
      "With no other states close to approving religious charter schools, said Stephanie Barclay, an expert on religious liberty at Georgetown Law School, there are no cases pending that raise the precise issue as the Oklahoma dispute.",
      "But she highlighted a case from Maine that raises questions about the extent to which religious schools can be barred from receiving government funding through tuition assistance, which the Supreme Court may have a chance to hear relatively soon if it wishes to further strengthen the Free Exercise Clause.",
      "\"That's a more likely next step the court could take,\" she said."

      "A federal judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal statuses of international students at universities across the U.S.",
      "In the injunction, District Judge Jeffrey S. White in Oakland also prohibited the administration from arresting or detaining any foreign-born students on the basis of their immigration status while a case challenging previous terminations moves through the courts.",
      "In his decision, White said that the Trump administration has \u201cwreaked havoc\u201d on the lives of the plaintiffs as well as other international students.",
      "Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the Department of Justice immediately responded to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Though many international students have been successful in individually challenging the Trump administration, guaranteeing their own right to stay in the U.S., the injunction is the first to provide relief to students nationwide.",
      "In the order, White wrote that the administration is barred from transferring any of the plaintiffs in ongoing cases to jurisdictions outside their residences, or from reversing any reinstatement of their records.",
      "While the Trump administration had said in court documents earlier this month that an injunction wasn't necessary because it had begun to restore statuses while Immigration and Customs Enforcement develops a new framework for terminations, the judge disagreed.",
      "\u201cAt each turn in this and similar litigation across the nation, Defendants have abruptly changed course to satisfy courts\u2019 expressed concerns,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIt is unclear how this game of whack-a-mole will end unless Defendants are enjoined from skirting their own mandatory regulations.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration began revoking the visas of thousands of international students in addition to their records and legal statuses in March. The terminations appeared to take aim at those who had participated in political activism or had criminal charges against them, like DUIs.",
      "And in late April, DHS revealed at a court hearing that the department used 10 to 20 employees to run the names of 1.3 million foreign-born students through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run computerized index that includes criminal history information.",
      "Experts have criticized the process, pointing out that the index relies on cities, counties, states and other sources to voluntarily report their data. And sometimes the database doesn\u2019t have the final dispositions of cases. It\u2019s why, immigration attorneys and policy experts say, some students who\u2019ve had cases dismissed, or were not convicted, likely still had their statuses revoked."

      "\u201cWe\u2019re really looking at an above normal season,\u201d said Ken Graham, a meteorologist and the director of the National Weather Service. \u201cWe\u2019re calling for 13 to 19 named storms.\u201d",
      "Storms get names when their wind speeds reach 39 mph or higher. Six to 10 of the forecasted storms are expected to become hurricanes, with wind speeds exceeding 74 mph. NOAA expects  three to five major hurricanes \u2014 Category 3 and above.",
      "The forecasts do not predict if or where the hurricanes will make landfall or how many of these storms will strike U.S. coastlines. Still, now is the time to prepare, forecasters said.",

      "\u201cThe warmer ocean temperatures is really consistent with us being in a more active season,\u201d Graham said at a news conference.",
      "Forecasters were also predicting higher activity from the West African Monsoon, a pattern that develops storms off the shore of continental Africa and sends them spinning across the Atlantic and toward the U.S.",
      "The hurricane forecast comes at a time when many National Weather Service offices are short on staff, after the Trump administration fired some workers and opened up voluntary retirement programs to cut staffing.",
      "In the first months of 2025, nearly 600 staffers have left the National Weather Service, opening staffing holes. Still, the agency's leadership said the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service, had the resources it needed.",
      "\u201cWe are fully staffed at the hurricane center, and we definitely are ready to go. And we are really making this up a top priority for this administration,\u201d said Laura Grimm, the acting administrator of NOAA.",
      "The nation's 122 local forecasting offices have been hard hit and are riddled with vacancies. Many of those offices will be tasked with forecasting local effects after a hurricane landfall, such as flood inundation and rainfall.",
      "\"I'm going to make sure that our offices, when there's a hurricane threat, that's going to have the resources that they need to make sure every warning goes out,\" Graham said, adding that he was working on solutions to \"make sure that we continue to have the staffing that we need long term.\"",
      "Hurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. It typically starts to peak in late summer and early fall.",
      "NOAA's forecast falls roughly in line with the public forecasts provided by outside research groups at universities, government agencies and private businesses.",
      "On average, outside research groups predicted eight Atlantic hurricanes in 2025, according to a website operated by Colorado State University and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which tracks and aggregates predictions each year.",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted its highest-ever hurricane season. The season delivered 18 named storms and 11 hurricanes. Five hurricanes struck the U.S. coastline. Hurricane Helene made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast, then tracked northward with intense rainfall, causing destructive inland flooding in North Carolina, among other states. Helene killed more than 150 people.",
      "Hurricane Milton made landfall as a Category 3 storm in Siesta Key Florida and produced 46 tornadoes.",
      "Both storms underwent rapid intensification, a phenomenon in which hurricane winds ramp up suddenly as the storm nears shore.",
      "Global warming makes that process more likely. High sea surface temperatures, like those observed over the past several years, can fuel that rapid intensification. A 2023 study found that tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean were about 29% more likely to undergo rapid intensification from 2001 to 2020, compared to 1971 to 1990."

      "Now the state is figuring out how to deal with the unusual problem of a mistaken veto.",

      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Armstrong wasn\u2019t the only governor to possibly flub a line-item veto this week. Late Wednesday, Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen announced that he would be striking about $47 million in funding and cash transfers over the next two years from budget bills passed last week by the Nebraska Legislature. Those cuts included about $12 million over two years for the Nebraska Supreme Court.",
      "But on Thursday afternoon, the Speaker of the Legislature John Arch announced the body would be sending a letter to Pillen, a fellow Republican, informing him he had missed a 5-day deadline, which came at midnight Wednesday, to properly file the line-item vetoes and that the line items are now law. Pillen\u2019s office responded that it handled the veto properly and would consult with the state attorney general about next steps.",
      "In North Dakota, the governor\u2019s staff called his veto of the housing budget in Senate Bill 2014 a markup error. Armstrong\u2019s staff met with the legislative council Thursday morning to discuss options.",
      "\u201cThis was an honest mistake, and we will fix it,\u201d a statement from the governor\u2019s office read.",
      "Armstrong, a Republican who served three terms in Congress, was elected governor in 2024. The legislative session that adjourned earlier in the month was his first as governor.",
      "In a message accompanying the veto, Armstrong wrote he had intended to veto a $150,000 grant to fund a Native American homelessness liaison position. The budget veto would take effect July 1.",
      "What happens next is largely up to the governor, Bjornson said, but it is likely that the legislature will need to reconvene in Bismarck for a special session. The governor\u2019s office said it will call a special session if needed but hopes to \u201cavoid the expense.\u201d",
      "If the legislature overrides the veto, that would include funding for the grant Armstrong had wanted to strike. If the legislature wants to only fund the $35 million housing budget, lawmakers may need to pass a new bill, which could take as long as three days, Bjornson said.",
      "The Legislature has six days available to use of its 80-day session limit, and a special session could open the opportunity to override other vetoes by the governor. The governor vetoed all or parts of four bills this session."

Kid Cudi recalled Diddy staring out a window with his hands behind his back like a \u201cMarvel supervillain.\u201d Diddy seemed to be unaware of the fire \u2014 but years later, he offered Kid Cudi a general apology for the past, Kid Cudi testified. Diddy\u2019s legal team says he wasn\u2019t involved in any arson attack.George Kaplan, Diddy\u2019s ex-assistant, described an altercation between the rapper and Cassie on a private jet in 2015. Kaplan testified he heard glass shatter and saw Diddy standing over Cassie with a whiskey glass. He said Cassie yelled: \u201cIsn\u2019t anybody seeing this?\u201d Kaplan said he once bought beauty products to cover up bruises on Cassie\u2019s face.Mylah Morales, a makeup artist who worked with Cassie (as well as Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez), testified about the aftermath of Diddy\u2019s alleged beating of Cassie after a party hosted by Prince. Morales said she didn\u2019t witness any violence but heard yelling and later saw Cassie with a swollen eye, busted lip and knots on her head.Frederic Zemmour, the general manager of the L\u2019Ermitage Beverly Hills hotel, told jurors that a room would require deep cleaning after one of Diddy\u2019s stays. The hotel\u2019s notes on the rapper\u2019s profile said he left behind \u201cexcessive amounts\u201d of oil and candle wax. (Diddy\u2019s legal team elected not to cross-examine Zemmour.)",

      "ALSO: In a 37-second video posted to X this afternoon, Kid Cudi directly addressed the camera and thanked his fans for \u201call the love and support\u201d in the lead-up to his testimony. \u201cThis is a stressful situation,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s behind me.\u201d",
      "The view from inside",
      "Kid Cudi was by far today\u2019s main attraction. The celebrated rapper, wearing a black leather jacket over a white T-shirt, drew a crowd of spectators in the rain outside the courthouse. He identified himself on the stand as an \u201cactor and musician,\u201d a nod to his roles in films like \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d and \u201cX.\u201d In general, he struck a confident tone and often spoke animatedly.",
      "Diddy, wearing a cream-colored top over khaki pants, sat back in his chair with his arms and legs crossed during parts of Kid Cudi\u2019s testimony. He seemed to be listening closely, calmly taking in the back-and-forth without displaying much emotion.",
      "Maurene Comey, one of the prosecutors, heatedly told Judge Arun Subramanian she was \u201cshocked\u201d that defense lawyer Brian Steel asked Kid Cudi about his sexual activity with Cassie, calling the question out of bounds and \u201coutrageous.\u201d Subramanian agreed, saying \u201cthe line was clear and crossed.\u201d He chastised Steel and ruled the exchange should be struck from the record.",
      "In other news: The reporters in the gallery were treated to some rare levity this morning as the attorneys debated whether Kid Cudi could testify about his dog\u2019s behavioral changes after the 2011 break-in at his home.",
      "Steel told Subramanian that prosecutors wanted the rapper to testify that his pet was traumatized. Emily Johnson, a prosecutor, argued that comments about the dog were relevant to the break-in.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not going to testify to what the dog thought,\u201d Subramanian said, drawing laughter. (Subramanian ultimately ruled that Kid Cudi could testify about the dog, but only in general terms. Johnson explained that the animal is \u201cno longer with us.\u201d)",
      "Analysis: Why the Molotov cocktail story matters",
      "Kid Cudi testified today that, in 2012, his dog watcher called to alert him that his car was on fire. He testified that it appeared someone had cut open the top of his Porsche, and \u201cthat\u2019s where the Molotov cocktail was put in,\u201d destroying the car.",
      "This is critical evidence for the prosecution because it is evidence of arson, which is one of the \u201cpredicate\u201d racketeering crimes listed in the racketeering (RICO) statute. However, Diddy is charged with racketeering conspiracy, which is even easier for the government to prove.",
      "To convict a defendant of racketeering conspiracy, the government must prove only that the defendant agreed with others to conduct the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering (those predicate crimes). The government does not need to prove a conspiracy to commit those specific predicate acts, like the arson of Kid Cudi\u2019s car.",
      "In fact, the government must prove only that two racketeering acts were, or were intended to be, committed as part of the conspiracy. The government does not have to prove that the defendant himself committed any of these predicate crimes (like arson). The government doesn\u2019t even need to prove Diddy himself agreed to commit any of the predicate acts (like arson).",
      "While the government must establish that Diddy participated in some manner in the overall objective of the conspiracy, it does not need to prove that the hip-hop mogul himself tossed a Molotov cocktail into the Porsche, or even that he participated in the arson himself.",
      "What\u2019s next",
      "No court tomorrow. The trial resumes on Tuesday, after Memorial Day. Enjoy your holiday weekend.",
      "PSA: Every night during Diddy\u2019s trial, NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d will drop special episodes of the \u201cTrue Crime Weekly\u201d podcast to get you up to speed. \u201cDateline\u201d correspondent Andrea Canning chats with NBC News\u2019 Chloe Melas and special guests \u2014 right in front of the courthouse.

      "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "It\u2019s a \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d edition of the newsletter today, as we break down the political ramifications, historical context and next steps for President Donald Trump and the GOP after the House passed the party\u2019s sweeping domestic policy package.",
      "Programming note: We are taking a few days off for the holiday weekend and will be back on Tuesday, May 27. Have a restful Memorial Day!",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "Trump has history on his side with his \u2018big, beautiful bill\u2019",
      "After the House passed a bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda early Thursday morning by a single vote, the measure faces more hurdles in the Senate.",
      "But don\u2019t bet against it becoming law.",
      "There\u2019s a long history of presidents getting Congress to deliver their top legislative priority, even when other items fall by the wayside. That\u2019s especially true when the president\u2019s party controls both chambers, as Trump\u2019s GOP currently does. Because of congressional rules, so-called budget reconciliation bills \u2014 like the one Trump is trying to get to his desk \u2014 only need a simple majority to pass in the Senate.",
      "For that reason, Trump was smart to roll a series of his major proposals into a single bill covering much of his agenda on taxes, immigration and more.",
      "Even for Republicans who aren\u2019t in love with every provision, it is politically perilous to stand in the way of a president of their own party. When push comes to shove, few will be willing to alienate their base voters to kill the newly elected president\u2019s plans. And if Trump loses the battle, he will make sure GOP voters know which lawmakers betrayed him.",
      "There may ultimately be a political downside for some Republicans who stick with Trump with the broader electorate, but there\u2019s no upside in turning him into an enemy in either a primary or a general election. No Republican can win a swing state or district if the GOP base doesn\u2019t turn out for them. Trump may be more openly vindictive than most recent presidents, but similar dynamics are always at play.",
      "In 1993, President Bill Clinton and a Democratic-led Congress prioritized his economic recovery package \u2014 not the more memorable \u201cHillarycare\u201d health insurance proposal. He passed the budget plan, while Hillarycare fell apart.",
      "In June 2001, President George W. Bush, with a Republican Congress behind him, enacted a major tax cut on bipartisan votes in the House and Senate.",
      "President Barack Obama\u2019s stimulus law flew through Congress \u2014 with Democrats in control of both chambers \u2014 in February 2009. And after months of fierce debate, he managed to sign the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010.",
      "Arguably, the big exception came in Trump\u2019s first term, when the Senate \u2014 on a decisive vote by then-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. \u2014 killed a push to repeal Obamacare. But Trump did get a signature tax law from the Republican-led Congress.",
      "In 2021, the Democratic-led Congress quickly sent a pandemic recovery bill to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk at the outset of his term. The rest of his \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan ran into snags and had to be reformulated and slimmed down to make it across the finish line.",
      "Some Republicans may distance themselves from Trump\u2019s agenda as the midterm elections approach, but that day has not yet come. And the smart money is on him eventually signing his \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d into law.",
      "How the Trump agenda bill will shape the next election",
      "Republicans\u2019 megabill is now set to play a major role in shaping the fight over who controls the House after the next election.",
      "Democrats need a net gain of just three seats next year to take back control of the chamber, after the GOP won the smallest House majority in almost 100 years in the last election. And they\u2019ve already started peppering the airwaves with attacks accusing the GOP of slashing Medicaid and prioritizing the wealthiest Americans.",
      "But Republicans are betting that the measure holds the key to proving to voters why they should grant them two more years of unified control of Washington, as opposed to the midterm backlash that typically hits a president\u2019s party. The GOP sees a bill that could energize Trump supporters by enacting his agenda and delivering key swing-state lawmakers some tangible victories to tout on the campaign trail.",
      "\u201cThe American people gave us a mandate in November. They sent a message with their vote. They gave this side of the aisle the power, and we\u2019re going to use it to make their lives better,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., sounded a different note: \u201cWhen the votes are ultimately cast on that first Tuesday in November next year, this day may very well turn out to be the day that House Republicans lost control of the United States House of Representatives.\u201d",
      "Read more on the midterm politics of the bill \u2192",
      "The defectors: Only two House Republicans, safe-seat Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Warren Davidson of Ohio, joined every Democrat in voting against the bill, saying it will further balloon the U.S. deficit.",
      "While Davidson\u2019s opposition came as a last-minute surprise, Massie had long made clear where he stood on the legislation.",
      "As Ben Kamisar and Scott Bland write, Massie is one of the rare Republicans who has found himself at odds with Trump on multiple occasions but has lived to tell the tale. The question is whether the tension evaporates as it has before or if Trump actually takes the step of backing a primary challenger against him in 2026.",
      "Prior to Thursday\u2019s vote, Trump blasted Massie as a \u201cgrandstander\u201d who \u201cshould be voted out of office\u201d \u2014 criticism Massie has pointed to in fundraising appeals for his own campaign.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a step up,\u201d Massie said of Trump\u2019s threats. \u201cIn 2020, he wanted me thrown out of the GOP, so losing a seat wouldn\u2019t be as bad as being thrown out, would it?\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s hyperbole on his part. I\u2019m not worried about it,\u201d Massie continued.",

      "\u2709\ufe0f Mailbag: The GOP\u2019s megabill moves to the Senate",
      "Thanks to everyone who emailed us! Here is this week\u2019s reader question:",
      "\u201cOn the spending bill, will it go through the Senate? How many will oppose it?\u201d",
      "One thing is clear at this point, hours removed from the House\u2019s passage of a massive bill for Trump\u2019s agenda: The Senate won\u2019t pass it as it\u2019s currently written.",
      "For weeks, GOP senators have outlined a variety of concerns with the measure their House colleagues put together. That list includes: the impact to the U.S. deficit, the level of Medicaid cuts, the rollback of clean energy tax credits and the higher cap for the state and local tax deduction.",
      "It will be Senate Majority Leader John Thune\u2019s job now to work through all these issues in the coming weeks. He can only afford to lose three Republican votes on the Senate floor \u2014 and he\u2019s already lost Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who staunchly opposes a provision in the bill that raises the debt ceiling. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin has even said he still wants to split up the sweeping legislation into two parts.",
      "But as Jonathan Allen writes above, when push comes to shove, skeptical Senate Republicans may find it difficult to stand in the way of the president and his agenda.",
      "Another complicating factor is that any changes the Senate makes to the package will have to go back through the House before GOP lawmakers can send the bill to Trump\u2019s desk, which they are hoping to do by July 4.",

    "summary": "Yearly cancer deaths linked to alcohol have doubled in the United States over the last three decades, rising from just under 12,000 a year in 1990 to more than 23,000 a year in 2021, new research finds.",

      "Yearly cancer deaths linked to alcohol have doubled in the United States over the last three decades, rising from just under 12,000 a year in 1990 to more than 23,000 a year in 2021, new research finds.",
      "The increase was driven by deaths in men 55 and older, the study authors said.",
      "U.S. cancer deaths overall have fallen by about 35% over the same time period, according to data from the American Cancer Society.",
      "The findings will be presented next week at the American Society of Clinical Oncology\u2019s annual meeting in Chicago and have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.",
      "\u201cThis is death as opposed to getting a disease. We can treat a lot of cancers, and we\u2019re getting better at that, but this is really driving home the point that people are dying from cancer due to alcohol,\u201d said Jane Figueiredo, a professor of medicine at the Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who was not involved with the research.",
      "The study focused on seven alcohol-related cancers: breast, liver, colorectal, throat, voice box, mouth and esophageal. Alcohol isn\u2019t responsible for every case of these cancers, but it has been shown to be a driving factor in a percentage of them.",
      "\u201cWhen people think about alcohol, they don\u2019t necessarily think of it as being a carcinogen like they do tobacco,\u201d said Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor of public health and community medicine at the Tufts University School of Medicine, who was not involved with the study.",
      "But it is. Once in the body, alcohol breaks down into acetaldehyde \u2014 a carcinogen also found in tobacco smoke. Alcohol damages DNA and makes it easier for the mouth and throat to absorb other carcinogens.",
      "The International Agency on Cancer Research, a branch of the World Health Organization, classified alcohol as a carcinogen in 1987. Research at that time linked drinking to cancers of the head and neck (including the mouth, throat, voice box and esophagus) and liver cancers. It\u2019s since been linked to breast and colorectal cancers.",
      "A January report from the former U.S. surgeon general said alcoholic drinks should come with cancer warning labels. According to WHO, there\u2019s no safe amount of alcohol consumption.",
      "The new research found that in 1991, 2.5% of all cancer deaths in men and 1.46% in women were related to alcohol. In 2021, those percentages rose to 4.2% and 1.85%, respectively.",
      "Over that same time period, men saw a 56% increase in deaths from alcohol-related cancers specifically. For women, it was nearly 8%.",
      "\u201cIt was not surprising that it was higher in men, but it was certainly surprising how much higher it was in men versus women,\u201d said study co-leader Dr. Chinmay Jani, chief fellow of hematology and oncology at the University of Miami\u2019s Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center. Historically, men have tended to start drinking alcohol earlier in life, Jani and his team noted.",
      "However, sex-based drinking habits appear to be shifting. In recent years, an increasing number of women have become heavy drinkers, and slightly more young women binge drink than men, research has found.",
      "Deaths from the seven alcohol-related cancers increased among men in 47 states, and in 16 states for women. In both groups, deaths among people living in New Mexico rose the most \u2014 nearly 60% for men and 18% for women. Oklahoma, for men, and Tennessee, for women, came in close second.",
      "Washington D.C. and New York saw the biggest decreases for men, and Massachusetts and New York for women. Utah remained the state with the lowest alcohol-related cancer deaths.",
      "Cancer deaths were highest among people 55 and older. In men in this age group, alcohol-related cancer deaths rose by more than 1% every year between 2007 and 2021.",
      "\u201cThe carcinogenic effect probably isn\u2019t affecting you right away in your younger age, but as you continue to drink as you age, this carcinogen has an accumulative effect on the body,\u201d Jani said.",
      "Of all seven alcohol-related cancers, liver, colorectal and esophageal cancers were the deadliest overall in 2021. In men specifically, liver cancer deaths were most common. For women, it was breast cancer.",
      "\u201cWe know that even small amounts of alcohol can affect the breast tissue,\u201d Figueiredo said.",
      "Jani said the next phase of research should tease out how different racial and ethnic groups are affected by alcohol differently when it comes to cancer risk.",
      "\u201cThe enzyme that metabolizes alcohol is lower in some ethnic groups than others, so acetaldehyde, the carcinogen in alcohol, is higher in these people,\u201d Jani said.",
      "Alcohol consumption in the U.S. hit its peak in the late 1970s and dropped until the late \u201990s, data from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism show. Drinking also rose sharply during the pandemic, as did alcohol-related deaths.",
      "Siegel said messaging around alcohol needs to shift from drinking responsibly to making sure people understand the health effects that even moderate drinking can pose.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re telling people they can\u2019t drink. Every person has the autonomy to make their own decisions,\u201d Siegel said. \u201cBut we want to make sure they are well-informed based on the facts rather than misconceptions.\u201d"

      "The tax bill the House passed Thursday would bar Medicaid coverage of all transgender care and prohibit plans offered under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges from covering such care as an essential health benefit, potentially jeopardizing access to care for hundreds of thousands of trans adults and an unknown number of minors.",
      "The bill initially would have prohibited Medicaid from covering \u201cgender transition procedures\u201d for minors, including puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery.  However, House Republican leadership introduced an amendment late Wednesday that struck the word \u201cminors\u201d and the words \u201cunder 18 years of age\u201d from that section, The Independent first reported.",
      "The amendment passed the GOP-led House Rules Committee on Wednesday night before the full House passed it Thursday morning.",
      "Another part of the bill would prohibit transition-related medical care as an essential health benefit under health care plans offered through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace. Essential health benefits packages vary by state but are required by federal law to cover 10 categories of benefits. Nearly half of states have prohibited health insurance providers from explicitly refusing to cover transition-related care.",
      "The tax bill\u2019s prohibitions could have a significant effect on hundreds of thousands of trans adults in the U.S. A report published this month by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found that about 180,000 trans adults use Medicaid as their primary insurance. Another study, published in 2023, found that nearly 1 in 4 (24.6%) trans adults are on Medicaid, or about 312,000, based on one estimate that there are 1.3 million trans adults in the U.S.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how many trans adults are enrolled in insurance through the health care marketplace. The Department of Health and Human Services reported that nearly 24 million people had enrolled in marketplace coverage by January. An additional 300,000 youth ages 13 to 17 identify as transgender, and it\u2019s unclear how many of them are on Medicaid or marketplace insurance plans.",
      "President Donald Trump has made curtailing access to care for trans people a priority of his administration. In the first few weeks of his presidency, he has signed several executive orders targeting trans people, including proclaiming that the government will recognize only two unchangeable sexes, prohibiting trans women and girls from playing on female sports teams, barring transgender people from serving openly in the military and restricting access to gender-affirming care nationwide for trans people younger than 19.",
      "Trump and other Republicans oppose access to transition-related care for minors, arguing that they are too young to make informed decisions about receiving such treatments and that the long-term effects of some of the treatments have not been well studied. LGBTQ advocates and medical professionals who treat trans people say those arguments aren\u2019t accurate and that they spread misinformation, and most major medical associations, such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, support access to such care.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who helped negotiate the amendment among Republicans, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The White House also didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it supports the amendment.",
      "LGBTQ advocates began forcefully speaking out against the tax bill Thursday. Jennifer Pizer, chief legal officer at Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, said it\u2019s unclear how the administration plans to argue against transition care for adults, who can make their own medical decisions and for whom transition care is well studied and supported.",
      "\u201cIt makes the animus, the hostility, against this group of people unmistakable,\u201d Pizer said. \u201cUnder any standard of constitutional review, laws based on animus or hostility to a group are not legitimate.\u201d",
      "If the bill becomes law as is, Pizer said, it would most likely face a legal challenge for potentially violating the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, which requires that laws treat people equally. She also noted that, after a suit by Lambda Legal and other LGBTQ advocacy groups, a federal judge blocked Trump\u2019s executive order that would have cut off all federal funding to medical schools and hospitals that provide transition care to minors.",
      "The bill would also directly conflict with laws in half of states that prohibit insurers from excluding coverage for gender-affirming care. In those cases, Pizer said, the states could use their own funding to continue covering the care under state Medicaid plans. However, \u201cthat\u2019s not a happy answer for people who live in other parts of the country, where states themselves are hostile to transgender people and this medical care.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis aggressive effort to reimpose exclusions, it\u2019s about hostility to a group, and it\u2019s a political movement,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not coming from medical experts or providers who engage with actual patients. This is about politics and not about anything that\u2019s justified in terms of our medical programs.\u201d"

    "summary": "The court indicated that its decision does not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve \u2014 a frequent target of Trump\u2019s criticism on economic matters.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday granted a Trump administration request that allows the president to fire members of independent federal agencies while suggesting that its legal reasoning would not apply to the Federal Reserve.",
      "The move to pause a lower court ruling formalizes a temporary decision along similar lines on April 9 that allowed President Donald Trump to fire Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board.",
      "\"The stay reflects our judgment that the government is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power,\" the court said in an unsigned order.",
      "The government, it added, \"faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.\"",
      "The high court\u2019s three liberal justices dissented.",
      "In a notable passage, the court sought to distinguish the case from any attempt by Trump to fire members of the Federal Reserve, including its chairman, Jerome Powell. The court noted that the Federal Reserve is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity\" that has its own distinct historical tradition.",
      "The Supreme Court\u2019s comments are likely to be well-received in global markets, which were rocked when Trump repeatedly ripped Powell in late March and early April, leading to speculation that he might try to fire him. Trump went so far as to say on Truth Social on April 17 that Powell\u2019s \u201ctermination cannot come fast enough!\u201d",
      "Trump later appeared to back off, saying he had \"no intention\" of firing Powell.",
      "Powell also came under fire repeatedly during Trump\u2019s first term, even though Trump himself nominated him for the role in November 2017.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, writing for the dissenters, said the court had in essence summarily overruled a key 1935 precedent, Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, which upheld the concept of independent agencies that are not directly subject to presidential control.",
      "In challenging that precedent, Trump decided \"to take the law into his own hands\" by firing Wilcox and Harris for no discernible reason, she added.",
      "\"Today, this court effectively blesses those deeds. I would not. Our Humphrey's decision remains good law, and it forecloses both the President\u2019s firings and the Court\u2019s decision to award emergency relief,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "She expressed puzzlement at the court's effort to create an exception for the Federal Reserve, arguing there is no reason the same legal rationale would not apply to it.",
      "\"If the idea is to reassure the markets, a simpler \u2014 and more judicial \u2014 approach would have been to deny the president\u2019s application for a stay,\" Kagan added.",
      "The case tees up the significant legal question of whether Congress, when it sets up federal agencies, can include provisions to insulate them from political interference that prevent the president from firing members at will.",
      "Although the Trump firings concern only two agencies, any ruling that allows such firings would apply to other agencies, too.",
      "If that happens, it would raise the question of whether the president would have the power to fire\u00a0members of the Federal Reserve, which traditionally operates independently of the White House.",
      "In recent rulings, the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has decided that provisions protecting single heads of independent agencies were unconstitutional. But the 1935 precedent that upheld the structure of multimember agencies remains on the books.",
      "The Trump administration has adopted legal arguments long made by conservative lawyers who favor broad presidential power; those arguments hold that independent agencies are not sufficiently accountable to the democratically elected president under the Constitution\u2019s separation-of-powers provision. The president should be able to fire agency heads at will, they argue.",
      "Then-President Joe Biden appointed Wilcox to the labor board, which adjudicates workplace disputes, in 2021. Her five-year term would have expired in 2026. Federal law states that the president can fire members only \u201cfor neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.\u201d",
      "Biden appointed Harris in 2022 to a seven-year term that has similar protections against removal. The Merit Systems Protection Board handles disputes involving federal employees.",
      "Trump sought to fire both soon after he took office.",
      "Wilcox and Harris both sued and won in lower courts, prompting the administration to go to the Supreme Court.",
      "Lawrence Hurley reported from Washington and Steve Kopack from New York."

      "FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson dissented to the suit when it was filed in January, when he was one of the regulator's commissioners. Now the agency\u2019s leader, Ferguson on Thursday again criticized the case as \u201ca nakedly political effort to commit this administration to pursuing little more than a hunch that Pepsi had violated the law.\u201d",

      "A sense of unease permeated the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory committee meeting Thursday.",
      "The advisers had convened for what\u2019s become a standard practice over the past few years: selecting a new strain for the fall\u2019s updated Covid vaccines.",
      "Complicating matters, however, were new FDA rules for the updated Covid vaccines, announced just days earlier, that would restrict access of the shots to only the most at-risk Americans.",
      "Under the rules, updated Covid vaccines for healthy children and adults under 65 must undergo additional placebo-controlled clinical trials \u2014 meaning some people would get the actual vaccine while others would get an inactive substance like a saline shot.",
      "The original Covid vaccines, approved in late 2020, went through this process. Since then, drugmakers transitioned over to a flu-vaccine model, using smaller studies to test whether the shots generated an immune response against the variant in question.",
      "New Covid vaccines for another group \u2014 adults 65 and up and kids and adults with at least one medical condition that puts them at risk for severe illness \u2014 were exempted from the new requirement, meaning additional clinical trials aren\u2019t needed.",
      "Committee members grappled with a tough choice: recommend updating the vaccine, which could make it more effective but harder for healthy kids and adults to get, or stick with the current version, which might not work as well but would be easier for more people to access.",
      "\u201cFor example, if a different strain was selected for this season, would that require additional clinical trials?\u201d committee member Dr. Sarah Meyer, chief medical officer of the immunization services division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, asked at one point.",
      "Ultimately, the committee unanimously voted to stick with vaccines targeting JN.1 or its lineages \u2014 the same strains used in the current shots. (Novavax\u2019s shot targets JN.1; Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s shots target KP.2, a descendant of JN.1.)",
      "The committee\u2019s vote is only a recommendation, and the FDA doesn\u2019t have to follow its advice.",
      "After the vote, anxiety lingered over the committee\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cI wanted to know if we change strains, can we assume that age-specific licensure won\u2019t change for any of these products?\u201d said committee member Dr. Henry Bernstein, a professor of pediatrics at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell in New York.",
      "Dr. Arnold Monto, the committee\u2019s chair, noted \u201ca feeling of somewhat unease\u201d over what he said would normally be an easy decision: picking the predominant strain.",
      "Jerry Weir, director of the Division of Viral Products in the Office of Vaccines Research and Review at the FDA, said that he didn\u2019t have an answer on who would be able to get the shots this fall, saying the agency was still working out details with the drugmakers.",
      "Still, FDA officials sought to allay committee members\u2019 concerns.",
      "\u201cOur goal is not to impact a timely availability of vaccines, but we\u2019re really looking to all of you to give us your best judgement,\u201d Dr. David Kaslow, the director of the FDA\u2019s Office of Vaccines Research and Review.",
      "The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is a group of outside scientists, doctors and public health experts that gives advice to the FDA on vaccines \u2014 including whether a vaccine is safe and effective, and whether it should be approved.",
      "The members are temporary, often serving in four-year terms.",
      "They must be highly qualified in areas like virology, infectious diseases and public health. They are required to report any professional or financial ties that might influence their judgment.",
      "If a conflict is found, they might be recused, or allowed to participate with restrictions, such as not being allowed to vote.",
      "Dr. Vinay Prasad, the FDA\u2019s new vaccine chief, told the panel that limiting access to older adults and people with underlying conditions would put the U.S. in line with Western Europe and other nations.",
      "The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says Covid vaccination efforts should focus on protecting people at risk of severe illness, such adults 60 and up, people with weakened immune systems and those with underlying medical conditions.",
      "\u201cUltimately, we still want to give people a little more time to digest the policy,\u201d Prasad said. \u201cWe\u2019re still interested in soliciting questions and feedback and thoughts.\u201d",
      "Dorit Reiss, a vaccine policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco, said she thinks the FDA will follow the committee\u2019s recommendation.",
      "\u201cBut they already announced they will take a different approach to licensing it, limiting it to certain group, and they did not put that in front of the committee at all,\u201d Reiss said."

      "The federal government\u2019s Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program is not operating, despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s claims that it's being funded.",
      "The program\u2019s 26 staffers were placed on administrative leave in April, with terminations set for June 2, as part of a broader restructuring of federal agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "To date, none of the staffers have been reinstated, with layoffs set to take effect in less than two weeks, said Erik Svendsen, director of the Division of Environmental Health Science and Practice, a department within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that includes the childhood lead program.",
      "Kennedy had faced criticism in recent weeks from Democratic senators over the gutting of the program, which assisted state and local health departments with blood lead testing and surveillance.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, Kennedy told Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., that the program was still being funded. The week before, he told Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., that he had no plans to eliminate it.",
      "But Svendsen said his entire division was dissolved by HHS and can\u2019t be easily replaced.",
      "\u201cThere are no other experts that do what we do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just push a button and get new people because our areas of public health are so specialized.\u201d",
      "Staffers in the childhood lead program have not received direction about how to transition their work, according to two CDC scientists familiar with the matter.",
      "Even low levels of lead exposure could put children at risk of developmental delays, learning difficulties and behavioral issues. The CDC program offered technical expertise to help under-resourced health departments prevent those outcomes. In 2023, it helped solve a nationwide lead poisoning outbreak linked to cinnamon applesauce. And it was in frequent contact with the Milwaukee Health Department this year after the city discovered dangerous lead levels in some public schools.",
      "Kennedy told Reed on Tuesday that \u201cwe have a team in Milwaukee\u201d offering laboratory and analytics support to the health department.",
      "But the Milwaukee Health Department said that Kennedy\u2019s statement was inaccurate, and that the city had not received any federal epidemiological or analytical support related to the lead crisis.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, in this case, that is another example where the secretary doesn\u2019t have his facts straight,\u201d said Mike Totoraitis, the city\u2019s health commissioner.",
      "Caroline Reinwald, a spokesperson for the Milwaukee Health Department, said that the federal government\u2019s only recent involvement in the lead crisis was \u201ca short, two-week visit from a single CDC staff member this month, who assisted with the validation of a new instrument in our laboratory.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis support was requested independently of the [Milwaukee Public Schools] crisis and was part of a separate, pre-existing need to expand our lab\u2019s long-term capacity for lead testing,\u201d Reinwald said in a statement.",
      "HHS has said it will continue efforts to eliminate childhood lead poisoning through a newly created department called the Administration for a Healthy America. But Democratic lawmakers and environmental health groups question how the work can continue without reinstating staffers.",
      "\u201cDespite what you told me last week, that you have no intention of eliminating this program, you fired the entire office responsible for carrying it out,\u201d Baldwin told Kennedy at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cYour decision to fire staff and eliminate offices is endangering children, including thousands of children in Milwaukee.\u201d",
      "HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Kennedy did not offer new details about his agency\u2019s restructuring plan at the hearing, citing a court order that compelled the Trump administration to pause efforts to downsize the federal government.",
      "Milwaukee\u2019s lead crisis became clear to health officials in February, when the city\u2019s health department identified dangerous levels of the toxin in school classrooms, hallways and common areas, due to lead dust and deteriorating lead-based paint.",
      "Before the childhood lead program was gutted, the CDC had been meeting with the Milwaukee Health Department on a weekly basis to come up with a plan to screen tens of thousands of students for lead poisoning, Totoraitis said.",
      "The city\u2019s health department asked the CDC on March 26 to send staffers to help, Totoraitis said, but the agency fired its childhood lead team on April 1 and denied Milwaukee\u2019s request two days later.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time in at least 75 years that the CDC has ever denied an Epi-Aid request, so it\u2019s a pretty historic moment,\u201d he said, referring to a request for the CDC to investigate an urgent public health problem.",
      "To date, the Milwaukee Health Department has identified more than 100 schools built before 1978, when the federal government banned consumer uses of lead-based paints. Around 40 of those have been inspected, Totoraitis said. Six schools have closed since the start of the year due to lead contamination, and only two have reopened.",
      "Around 350 students in Milwaukee have been screened for lead poisoning out of 44,000 identified as having a potential risk, Totoraitis said. The city has confirmed one case linked to lead exposure in school, and two more linked to exposures at both school and home. The health department said it is investigating an additional four cases, which may involve multiple sources of exposure.",
      "Totoraitis said the department is accustomed to looking for lead in homes and rental units, but the CDC was supposed to help them scale that operation to inspect larger buildings. CDC staffers were also supposed to help set up lead screening clinics and investigate where kids had been exposed, he said.",
      "While the health department is handling those efforts on its own now, Totoraitis said it may not have the capacity to screen everyone in a timely manner. He estimated that the department could manage around 1,000 to 1,200 cases of childhood lead poisoning a year. That includes testing kids\u2019 blood lead levels, treating lead poisoning with chelation therapy (which removes heavy metals from the bloodstream) and eliminating exposures in the home by replacing windows and doors.",
      "Totoraitis said he\u2019s hoping to hire two of the terminated CDC employees for at least a couple of weeks to help address lingering questions about how to manage the crisis.",
      "Better yet, he said,\u00a0\u201cI keep hoping to get an email from them saying, \u2018Hey, we got our jobs back.\u2019\u201d"

      "The ruling is likely to be welcomed by Italian LGBTQ groups who have repeatedly clashed with the conservative government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a self-declared enemy of what she and her allies call the \u201cLGBT lobby.\u201d",
      "The court found that denying legal recognition to the nonbiological mother violates the constitutional principles of equality and personal identity and violates the child\u2019s rights to care, education and emotional continuity from both parents.",
      "The decision strikes down part of a 2004 law which did not allow both women in a same-sex couple to be registered as legal mothers, even if both consented to the procedure.",
      "Marilena Grassadonia, an LGBTQ rights activist from the Italian Left opposition party, said the ruling marked a \u201chistoric day\u201d which \u201crestores dignity and serenity to the many rainbow families who live in our country.\u201d",
      "The case was brought by a court in the Tuscan city of Lucca, which questioned the legality of denying \u201cfull dual parenthood\u201d in a case involving a lesbian couple.",
      "The judges noted that confusion over the law had led to inconsistent rulings in various courts. This has left individual mayors, who control the civil registry in their municipalities, to make differing decisions in comparable cases.",

      "\u201cThese divergent outcomes reflect a shifting social reality to which the legislature has yet to respond,\u201d the referral said.",
      "The ruling did not alter Italy\u2019s current restrictions on access to IVF, which is still limited to heterosexual couples, but marked a shift toward the recognition of LGBTQ parenting rights.",
      "In a separate verdict also released on Thursday, the Constitutional Court said rules preventing single women from accessing IVF were not unconstitutional but said they could be changed if a political will for it emerged in parliament."

    "published": "Thu, 22 May 2025 20:04:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Julius Randle wasn't known as a strong playoff performer before arriving in Minnesota this season. He's changed that reputation with the Timberwolves.",
    "story": [
      "The 2025 NBA postseason has unmistakably been shaped by trades \u2014 deals that landed big man Karl-Anthony Towns in New York, All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton in Indiana and future league MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in Oklahoma City.",
      "Among the four remaining teams, however, no trade was more high-risk, high-reward than the Minnesota Timberwolves' decision last September, coming off one of the most successful seasons in franchise history, to send Towns, a franchise cornerstone, to the Knicks.",
      "In one way, it was a reaction to the NBA\u2019s year-old collective bargaining agreement, which makes it more difficult to keep together expensive, deep rosters for long by taking away top-spending teams\u2019 ability to draft and make trades. Towns was set to begin a four-year contract worth more than $220 million, and the players Minnesota received, reserve guard Donte DiVincenzo and forward Julius Randle, earned less this season than Towns combined.",
      "The financial flexibility in the trade, \"allows them to remake the team around Anthony Edwards\" in the long-term, said Chris Hine, the longtime Timberwolves beat writer for the Minneapolis Star Tribune.",
      "But the move was also effectively a belief that Towns' big-man replacement in the deal, Randle, could serve as a reasonable facsimile. It represented a gamble: that Randle, a regular-season All-Star whose history of postseason struggles had soured his time in New York, could help push a Timberwolves franchise with its own lack of playoff history over the top and into the team\u2019s first Finals.",
      "Minnesota trails Oklahoma City, 1-0, in the Western Conference finals, but Randle has remade his postseason reputation, averaging 24.3 points with 5.5 assists while making 58 percent of his 2-pointers and nearly 40 percent of his 3-pointers. The Timberwolves have made conference finals in consecutive seasons for the first time.",
      "\"I don't get into the narratives of having something to prove, the only thing I want to prove is I'm a winner,\" Randle said after Minnesota beat Golden State in a second-round series in five games.",
      "In these playoffs, Randle has shot 50 percent on nearly 100 possessions when guarded primarily by LeBron James during the first round, and shot 58 percent when guarded by perennial defensive player of the year candidate Draymond Green during the second. Overall, Randle has attempted fewer three-pointers but made more, and handled the ball less but generated more points. In the Game 1 loss to Oklahoma City, Randle scored 20 of Minnesota\u2019s 48 points at halftime.",
      "The turnaround was most evident against Golden State. In Game 3, with the series tied, Randle produced a triple double despite a poor-shooting performance by assisting on 12 baskets. He averaged 25 points during the series. On the approximately 105 possessions in which Green guarded Randle, the Timberwolves scored 105 points, and Randle shot 58 percent, according to NBA data.",
      "\"I lost my matchup,\" Green said on his podcast, adding it was something that had happened only one other time during his lengthy postseason career. \"Julius was incredible. And honestly some of the shots he was taking was shots that you want him to take and he made them. ... I got to give it to him, man. He got the better of me.\"",
      "The 30-year-old Randle \u2014 the No. 7 pick in the 2014 draft \u2014entered the NBA with expectations that he could produce like this, only to have them immediately undercut; 14 minutes into his NBA debut, he broke his leg. It wasn't until his sixth season, in New York, that he became a team's top offensive option. It led to the first of his three All-Star appearances with the Knicks. Yet Randle was criticized for making 34.4% of his shots during two postseason runs with the Knicks \u2014 well below his 47.1% career average.",
      "Last September, he called the trade a \u201cbreath of fresh air,\u201d but it came with immediate struggles. He averaged 18.7 points per game, his lowest average in eight seasons, and wasn\u2019t an All-Star for the first time in three. When the Timberwolves started the season an unremarkable 8-10 their star guard, Edwards, made a remarkable admission.",
      "\u201cWe playing with a bunch of little kids. Everybody, the whole team,\u201d Edwards said Nov. 27. \u201cWe just can\u2019t talk to each other. And we\u2019ve got to figure it out.\u201d",

      "The transformation took place gradually. Where Randle focused on scoring during his first months with Minnesota, upon returning from a groin injury in early March, he was playing a point-forward role devised by coach Chris Finch.",
      "Minnesota was 17-4 after Randle\u2019s return from injury, a stretch that turned a team of ill-fitting parts into that would beat the Lakers and Warriors in consecutive rounds in five games.",
      "\u201cRandle points to his injury as helping him gain some perspective on how the offense should operate,\u201d Hine said. \u201cHe saw how well the Wolves were doing on that end of the floor when they could generate good ball movement. After trying to find the right balance between scoring and distributing, he shifted more toward the playmaking end of that dynamic, and that made a big difference for him and the Wolves.\u201d",
      "Since Jan. 22, Minnesota is 30-7 with Randle in the lineup, and 14 points better offensively with him on the court (though also seven points worse defensively).",
      "\u201cI think his relationship with Chris Finch played a big part\u201d of Randle getting comfortable, Hine said. \u201cThe two knew each other dating back to when they were both in New Orleans. Randle came in praising Finch\u2019s coaching ability and how great their year was together from his opening press conference.",
      "\u201cDespite frustration in the fan base with Randle\u2019s fit, Finch always stood by Randle, kept telling him they would figure it all out, and sure enough they did. I think his re-emergence is a credit to Finch having that relationship and patience with him, and a credit to Randle for sticking with it when other players might have given up.\""

    "story": [
      "A federal judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal statuses of international students at universities across the U.S.",
      "In the injunction, District Judge Jeffrey S. White in Oakland also prohibited the administration from arresting or detaining any foreign-born students on the basis of their immigration status while a case challenging previous terminations moves through the courts.",
      "In his decision, White said that the Trump administration has \u201cwreaked havoc\u201d on the lives of the plaintiffs as well as other international students.",
      "Neither the Department of Homeland Security nor the Department of Justice immediately responded to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "Though many international students have been successful in individually challenging the Trump administration, guaranteeing their own right to stay in the U.S., the injunction is the first to provide relief to students nationwide.",
      "In the order, White wrote that the administration is barred from transferring any of the plaintiffs in ongoing cases to jurisdictions outside their residences, or from reversing any reinstatement of their records.",
      "While the Trump administration had said in court documents earlier this month that an injunction wasn't necessary because it had begun to restore statuses while Immigration and Customs Enforcement develops a new framework for terminations, the judge disagreed.",
      "\u201cAt each turn in this and similar litigation across the nation, Defendants have abruptly changed course to satisfy courts\u2019 expressed concerns,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIt is unclear how this game of whack-a-mole will end unless Defendants are enjoined from skirting their own mandatory regulations.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration began revoking the visas of thousands of international students in addition to their records and legal statuses in March. The terminations appeared to take aim at those who had participated in political activism or had criminal charges against them, like DUIs.",
      "And in late April, DHS revealed at a court hearing that the department used 10 to 20 employees to run the names of 1.3 million foreign-born students through the National Crime Information Center, an FBI-run computerized index that includes criminal history information.",
      "Experts have criticized the process, pointing out that the index relies on cities, counties, states and other sources to voluntarily report their data. And sometimes the database doesn\u2019t have the final dispositions of cases. It\u2019s why, immigration attorneys and policy experts say, some students who\u2019ve had cases dismissed, or were not convicted, likely still had their statuses revoked."

Like, you put your kid in something and you really put them all in,\" Arnold, 31, said during a recent appearance on the \u201cHot Smart Rich\u201d podcast.",
      "The Provo, Utah native, whose younger sister, Rylee Arnold, later made her own debut as a \u201cDWTS\" pro in 2023, said the pair's parents \"loved pushing\" them in their dancing \"passions\" when they were kids because it kept them \"out of trouble.\"",
      "\u201cIf we weren\u2019t at home for hours after school, just bored out of our minds looking for something to do, we weren\u2019t getting in as much trouble,\" she explained.",

    "summary": "Julianne Moore unpacks the ending to Netflix's \"Sirens\" and why she thinks her character Michaela winds up in a \"good place.\"",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for \"Sirens.\"",
      "Is Michaela Kell's mysterious lifestyle really a cult? The question that loomed over the five episodes of Netflix's \"Sirens\" is finally answered in the finale, which premiered on May 22.",
      "The resolution of an explosive weekend on a lavish New England island leaves no character unscathed, as the lives of the people in Michaela's orbit are completely upended.",
      "Julianne Moore, who stars as Michaela in the series, tells TODAY.com the series started as a look at the Greek myth of sirens \u2014 winged creatures, half-birds and half-women, with songlike voices capable of luring sailors at sea to their demise.",
      "\u201cWhy do we hear about the sirens from this perspective? We always hear about it from the sailors\u2019 perspectives, not from the sirens\u2019 perspective,\u201d Moore says. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, what are the sirens asking for? And in fact, why are they responsible and not the men?\u201d",
      "\u201cThe men are always saying, \u2018These women lured me in. These women made me crash my ship. These women made me throw my life away.\u2019 Suddenly, these men have no agency. They have no autonomy,\u201d she adds.",
      "Moore says it was the daughter of the series\u2019 showrunner, Molly Smith Metzler, who asked her mom the questions about Greek sirens that led her to write the play the series is based on.",
      "\u201cI think Molly wanted to incorporate that idea into the show, this idea of, \u2018What\u2019s their story?\u2019\u201d Moore says.",
      "What is 'Sirens' about?",
      "The five-episode Netflix series also stars Meghann Fahy as Devon, who travels to the island after being unable to reach her sister Simone, played by Milly Alcock, who is employed as Michaela's assistant.",
      "Devon's arrival on the island causes utter chaos in Michaela's perfectly precise and planned out life. The final episode starts at the end of the whirlwind weekend, as Michaela's annual gala is just beginning.",
      "Michaela has been preparing for the event with beloved assistant Simone by her side for months, but the party gets upended when Michaela decides to fire her hours before it's set to begin. The socialite discovered that her husband, Peter Kell (Kevin Bacon), kissed Simone \u2014 and had photographic evidence to prove his infidelity.",
      "While Simone insisted Peter came on to her and that she walked away after the kiss, the discovery came after Michaela found out Simone had been lying to her about her secret relationship with Peter's best friend Ethan (Glenn Howerton).",
      "Simone and Ethan did go public with their relationship earlier in the season, leading him to propose to her, but Simone turned him down. After the rejection, Ethan began to spiral, and he fell off of a cliff while fighting with Simone.",
      "How does 'Sirens' end?",
      "The beginning of Episode 5 starts with Ethan recovering in the hospital, and when he sees Simone in the room, he starts screaming and telling her to get out. Kevin sticks up for Simone, telling Ethan he needs to respect her.",
      "Moore says the series represents a push-and-pull of power dynamics between men and women. While it may look like Michaela is calling the shots, it\u2019s really Peter who is pulling the strings all along.",
      "\u201cPeter Kell has all the power because he has all the money, and this is very much about social and economic hierarchy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd when you really peel it back, you realize the person making the decisions, if you go all the way up, is that billionaire.\u201d",
      "After Peter asks Michaela why she fired Simone, he sees Simone running down to the beach. He follows her, and he tells her that the end of her employment was his fault and that he would fix it. She says she has to tell him something, but the scene cuts away.",
      "The gala is in full swing back at the house as Devon confronts Michaela about the rumors she's a cult leader \u2014 and that she killed Peter's first wife \u2014 in front of all of the guests. Michaela shares that after Peter's divorce, his ex-wife had botched plastic surgery and became a recluse, shutting down all of the town gossip.",
      "After the confrontation, Peter approaches Michaela and asks to talk to her in private. He then tells her he wants a divorce after he claims she kept him from his children from his previous marriage. He also reveals that he had found the photo of him and Simone \u2014 and destroyed it.",
      "Moore says she thinks Devon's arrival on the island may have ignited the tension between Michaela and Peter, but adds their marriage was doomed no matter what.",
      "\"I think it was inevitable,\" Moore says. \"I think these kind of situations, particularly in marriages, if that\u2019s gonna happen, that\u2019s gonna happen. So it\u2019s not like Devon not coming would have changed anything. I think there would have been the same result.\"",
      "After Michaela storms out of the room, Simone walks down a set of stairs wearing an evening gown. Peter extends his hand, and walks her out \u2014 signaling that what they talked about down at the beach was starting a real relationship.",
      "As they walk into the gala, Simone sees Devon and fills her in that she's now with Peter, much to Devon's shock. Devon says she is going to go back to Buffalo to take care of their father, and the pair share a tearful goodbye when it's clear Simone is planning to stay on the island with Peter.",
      "Simone gets up and gives a toast to the gala's attendees, standing in Michaela's usual place. Devon gets on a ferry back to the mainland.",
      "On the ferry, she runs into Michaela and the pair have a heartfelt conversation about what's next for them.",
      "\"I think she\u2019s ready to get on with her life,\" Moore says of her character. \"In a sense, she\u2019s kind of back to herself. She\u2019s really back to someone who doesn\u2019t know what her future is, but she has agency, and she\u2019ll make decisions based on her own life and her own needs. So I actually think she\u2019s in a good place.\"",
      "The episode ends with a shot of Simone standing in front of Peter's home, looking out at what is now hers and thinking about all it took for her to get here \u2014 and what happened to the person who got in her way."

      "\u201cWe were there working for the Olympics last summer, and she sent me a text that said, \u2018Let\u2019s go have lunch,\u2019\u201d Willie tells TODAY.com, adding that Garten\u2019s publicist and book editor Kate Tyler tagged along. \u201cThe three of us tucked into a little corner of a tiny little restaurant in Paris, and I felt like I was walking through a dream.\u201d",

      "The pair of personalities, who enjoyed a kir royale and dessert platter onstage, have broken bread many times in the past.

      "\u201cHonest to God, I thought she was great,\u201d Willie continues, adding that her chill vibe made it feel like they were just having lunch at her house. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reminder of what it\u2019s like to be on that side of it, about making our guests comfortable so that they open up more, reveal and feel like it\u2019s a place where they can really share.\u201d"

      "Miley Cyrus revealed the medical condition that's behind her unique voice, and why it impacts her ability to go on tour.",
      "Cyrus shared more about her Reinke's edema diagnosis in an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe on May 21.",
      "\u201cI have the Reinke\u2019s edema, which is something that is called, it\u2019s abuse of the vocal cords,\u201d Cyrus said. \u201cAnd being 21 and staying up and drinking and smoking and partying after every show does not help. But also in my case, it does not cause it. So my voice always sounded like this \u2014 it's a part of my unique anatomy.\u201d",
      "Reinke's edema, also known as polypoid corditis or vocal cord edema, is a voice disorder caused by the swelling of the vocal chords, and occurs when fluid builds up in the outer layer of the vocal chords, according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The disorder is most common in people with a long-term history of smoking, but people with chronic acid reflux, or a history of repetitive vocal trauma, like Cyrus, can also be affected.",
      "The \"Flowers\" singer went on to add that she also has a large polyp on her vocal chord, which she says has given her \"a lot of the tone and the texture\" that has made her who she is as a performer.",
      "\"But it's extremely difficult to perform with, because it's like running a marathon with ankle weights on,\" she said.",
      "Cyrus, 32, said that sometimes when she calls her mother, Tish Cyrus, at the end of the day, her mom tells her, \"Oh, you sound like you're talking through a radio.\"",
      "\"And that's how you know I'm really tired, because it creates that ultimate vocal fry,\" Cyrus said. \"And so I do have this blessing of a condition that I live with.\"",
      "Cyrus said that even though she has both Reinke's edema and the large polyp on her vocal chord, she doesn't have plans to remove the polyp.",
      "\"I'm not willing to sever it, because the chance of waking up from a surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability,\" she said.",
      "Cyrus told Lowe she plans a tour \"like every other week,\" but that her health and other factors play into her actually going on the road to perform.",
      "\"I want to do it, but it would have to be in a way that is sustainable for me in all the ways that we talked about, and then also with what I got going on,\" she said. \"Like, I don't lip sync. I sing live, and these songs are big.\"",
      "She referred to two songs on her upcoming record, \"Something Beautiful,\" which is set to drop on May 30.",
      "\"'End of the World' is a huge song, and 'More to Lose,' it's really strenuous, it's a big song. And so I don't write little songs,\" Cyrus said. \"And even if you listen to the past albums, like 'Party in the U.S.A.,' maybe, if you're in the audience and you're singing along, it's one thing, but when you've got the mic and you're performing, it's totally different.\"",
      "Cyrus also listed the logistics of traveling with a big crew, plus transporting the stage and lights, and needing to be able to play a certain amount of shows for it to \"mathematically make sense.\"",
      "\"So really, the problem for me with touring, is not only me, because this is about connecting with people around the world and using my music as a tool to heal,\" she said. \"I've always said, medicate a sick culture through these songs that I've created, or am creating. But the truth of it is is that touring, as much of it's an experience for the audience, it's a business for everybody else.\""

      "By the end of the three-hour Season 48 finale, just three castaways lasted to the Final Tribal Council: Kyle, Eva and Joe.",
      "After the jury members' votes were cast, Probst continued the divisive recent tradition of announcing the winner then and there.",
      "Kyle Fraser won \"Survivor\" 48, Probst revealed. Read on for how it all shook out.",
      "What happened during the 'Survivor' 48 finale?",
      "Following the blindside of Shauhin Davari in the penultimate episode, the final five returned to their Niu Nai camp to discuss Tribal Council. Eva and Joe thanked Kyle for tipping them off that Shauhin had turned on them, not realizing that Kyle and Kamilla concocted a plan to trick the duo into eliminating Shauhin.",
      "Kyle pointed out in his confessional that he was in a good spot, with the option of either sticking beside his strongest ally, Kamilla, or going to the final three with Eva and Joe. But, he still had more obstacles to tackle, like winning the next immunity challenge. He also worried about how Eva planned to play her hidden immunity idol.",
      "Meanwhile, Kamilla marveled at her lying abilities, adding that she planned to own all her deceptive game play if she made it to Final Tribal Council.",
      "But first, the players had to unlock a puzzle that would give them an advantage in the next challenge. Eva secured the advantage by cracking the code.",
      "At the next immunity challenge, which also included a pasta-filled reward, Probst welcomed the final five and explained that Eva's advantage allowed her to skip one of the ball toss sections. But despite the leg up, Kamilla pulled off the victory in a \u201cmassive comeback,\u201d as the host said.",
      "After Kamilla secured her spot in the final four, the other finalists had multiple conversations to decide who would join the jury as the next castaway voted out of \u201cSurvivor\" 48. Although the obvious choice seemed to be to get rid of Joe, Kamilla and Kyle contemplated eliminating Mitch instead. They were convinced that Mitch could make a better pitch to the jury if he made it to the end of the game.",
      "So when the second-to-last Tribal Council began, Mitch was a sitting duck. Kyle directly told Probst that Mitch's name was tossed around at camp. Mitch became emotional as he said it \"sucked\" knowing his game was over. But, he said he didn't have any regrets.",
      "With Mitch getting his torch snuffed, the final four journeyed to the Niu Nai camp, again, and celebrated.",
      "The next morning, the final four watched the sunrise together. In her confessional, Eva said she would take Joe to the end despite him being a strong competitor. Kamilla had a different plan for her other half in the game. She told Kyle she would select him to make fire against Joe. Kyle agreed with her thinking. As for Joe, he wanted to go to the end with Eva.",
      "For the final immunity challenge, Probst said the final four would have to\u00a0participate in a \"Survivor\" \"classic.\" The ball challenge, called \"Simmotion,\" which has appeared in multiple past seasons, required concentration and hand-eye coordination.",
      "After a close battle with Joe, Kyle became the last \u201cSurvivor\" 48 contestant to have the immunity necklace placed around his neck. He was also tasked with choosing which castaway would automatically join him in the finale, thus confirming the other two would have to participate in the fire-making challenge.",
      "Kyle upheld a promise he made before the challenge and told Joe he was taking him to the final three, meaning Eva and Kamilla had to make fire. While prepping for the challenge, Eva became overwhelmed. Joe offered to take her spot, but she declined. So, he sat with her and shared some tips to improve her fire-making skills.",
      "Before facing off, the jury looked stunned to learn that Kyle chose Joe. Each player then sat at their respective stations and began building their fires. Eva easily pulled off the victory, cementing her spot in the final three, as Kamilla struggled to get anything going.",
      "On Day 26, the last day of the season, Kyle, Joe and Eva enjoyed their breakfast feast as viewers heard the jury \u2014 Cedrek McFadden, Chrissy Sarnowsky, David Kinne, Star Toomey, Mary Zheng, Shauhin, Mitch and Kamilla \u2014 share what they hoped to hear at Final Tribal Council.",
      "As the sun set, Eva, Kyle and Joe made their way to Probst, ready to be grilled by the eliminated cast members.",
      "Probst advised them, \"Own your game and claim your victory,\" before the questions began.",
      "Multiple secrets were spilled, including Kyle revealing his true occupation as a lawyer and his undercover partnership with Kamilla.",
      "For their final pitches, Kyle said he was the most well-rounded player because he built strong relationships and played in the middle all season long. Joe spoke about being a 45-year-old firefighter and needing the money to take care of his family. Eva said  there has never been a player like her on the show and that she \"embodied\" the season by being \"unprecedented.\"",
      "After the votes were cast, Probst revealed that Kyle won, receiving five votes. Eva had two and Joe had one, marking a rare occasion in which all three finalists received votes at Final Tribal Council.",

Despite having never obtained an undergraduate degree, the 44-year-old pursued a nontraditional legal education path known as \u201creading the law,\u201d a program available in California and a number of other states.

No law school lectures, no ivory tower shortcuts, just determination and a mountain of case log books to read.\u201d",

    "summary": "Gillian Flynn opens up about her imprint and writing process in a new interview.",
    "story": [
      "When Gillian Flynn sits down to write a book, she never knows the ending.",
      "Such was the case when the New York Times bestselling author wrote her thrilling novel-turned-film \u201cGone Girl,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cI see it at the beginning. I always know my beginning scene,\u201d Flynn says. \"I pictured it with \u2018Gone Girl \u2014 a man coming home to a house and the door is wide open, and that moment of feeling like, \u2018Why is the door wide open?\u2019\u201d",
      "As a self-proclaimed true crime fanatic, Flynn says her initial scenario invoked fear around, \u201cWhat would it be like to have your spouse mysteriously disappear? And everyone says, \u2018It\u2019s always the husband.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd you cannot not look guilty. Because if you\u2019re crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s putting on a show.\u2019 And if you\u2019re not crying, people say, \u2018Oh, he doesn\u2019t care. He\u2019s a freak.\u2019\u201d she adds. \u201cSo, you know, I started playing with that from there.\u201d",
      "For any book Flynn writes, be it her 2006 debut \"Sharp Objects\" or 2012's \u201cGone Girl,\u201d the plot unfolds as she gets inside her characters' heads.",
      "This means Flynn reaches the story's end nearly at the same point the reader does \u2014 but she gets to choose how the characters are remembered in their final moments on the page.",
      "For \u201cGone Girl,\u201d Flynn says the twisted ending readers now know didn\u2019t always exist. Instead, she tells TODAY.com how the book originally painted characters Amy and Nick.",
      "\u201cThere was the one (ending) I was originally going to go with \u2014 that you didn\u2019t know that Amy had framed Nick until the very end, so you didn\u2019t meet Amy at all,\u201d Flynn says, explaining that the draft's entire story was \u201call Nick\u2019s point of view as he\u2019s bouncing around, looking more and more guilty.\u201d",
      "In this end of the story, which \u201cno one read\u201d aside from Flynn, the reader would have discovered Amy framed the man they\u2019d been following for the entire novel, naturally prompting more sympathy for Nick.",
      "\u201cAnd then I started thinking, \u2018Who is this woman who did all this stuff?\u2019 I kept getting obsessed with, \u2018Who would do this?\u2019 And so then I was like, \u2018I need Amy in this story. I can\u2019t hide her until then. That\u2019s no fun,\u2019\u201d Flynn says.",
      "As readers know, Amy became the focal point of the page-turner. But Flynn wrote other endings, too.",
      "\u201cI had the Ozark grifters come back into (Amy\u2019s) life at the end and frame her,\u201d Flynn says. \u201cI did have one ending where she was going to go to jail and that lasted for a day, literally. I was like, \u2018She would never go to jail. Amy would never go to jail.\u2019\u201d",
      "Though Flynn is known for her twists, she says she's more interesting in making points about the human psyche and larger-scale world issues.",
      "\u201cI always say, I write character studies and themes, and I hide it all inside the chocolate of a juicy mystery, so that I can get people to read it,\u201d she says.",
      "Now, Flynn is working on screenwriting and also became a publisher herself, starting her own imprint, Gillian Flynn Books, with upcoming titles like Danie Shokoohi's \"Glass Girls.\"",
      "Flynn chatted with TODAY.com about her books, her new imprint and the advice she'd give aspiring authors.",
      "This interview has been edited.",
      "How did you decide to make the move into publishing with Gillian Flynn Books?",
      "It started with Molly Stern, who was my publisher during \u201cGone Girl,\u201d asking me if I'd be interested in an imprint.",
      "I wasn't looking to have an imprint. But I realized I could create my own mission statement and could make sure there were voices getting out there who weren't just copying whatever previous popular book was, falling into a pre-arranged shape or done only by people who already have platform.",
      "I find a really dangerous trend, that this current market is really squashing out the kind of voices that I love, which are the quirky, weird, off kilter, not easy to put inside a box.",
      "The current series that I\u2019m publishing, Margot Douaihy\u2019s series, is about a punk rock former addict nun who is totally tattooed and solves mysteries in New Orleans. Or Stacy Horn\u2019s nonfiction book, \u201cThe Killing Fields of East New York,\u201d is all about white collar crime and how it decimated a community. These are things that aren\u2019t necessarily going to get snapped up immediately. And I wanted to give that voice.",
      "Was it intentional that all the authors you've published so far have been female?",
      "It is not. It has just happened to be the ones that have come to me that I really, really love. It has not been an intentional thing, but it has been the ones so far that have really drawn me.",
      "Would you agree the audience predominantly consuming crime and thriller storylines are women? Why do you think that is?",
      "I think women are more acquainted with fear than men are. We live with it as part of our everyday. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t obsess you or control you too much, but I don\u2019t know any woman who doesn\u2019t, in the very back of her mind go, \u2018\" could walk out the door and if I walk down the wrong corner, if I stay out too late, if I get in the wrong place, something really, really bad could happen to me.\" I don\u2019t know very many women who haven\u2019t had some sort of close up moment that made them a little frightened. I mean, we all carry that with us.",
      "I think the crime genre, when it\u2019s done right, really can touch on that issue and give us a vocabulary and a means to talk about it, and give us almost a way to purge that fear a little bit \u2014 understanding that it\u2019s out there and that I\u2019m not crazy. Sometimes you have that moment of, like, \u2018\"m I crazy to be nervous in this situation? Is it me?\" And the answer is f------ better safe than sorry.",
      "Writing wise, what are you working on right now?",
      "I\u2019m working on a lot, writing wise. Most of it is screenplay stuff. Ever since I did adapted \u201cGone Girl\u201d for the screen, I\u2019ve been really attracted to screenwriting and creating film and TV. And that\u2019s largely because I grew up in a household where my mom taught reading and my dad taught film. And so, to me, they\u2019re both equally viable ways of telling a story.",
      "The one I\u2019m most excited about is adapting \u201cDark Places,\" my second book, for HBO. It's not official yet, but fingers crossed.",
      "I\u2019ve told myself that after I get these couple projects done, that I\u2019m going to shut down that part for a little bit and just finish this book I\u2019m writing. It\u2019s daunting writing a book after \u201cGone Girl.\u201d You have the demons on your shoulder going, \u201cIs this too much like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019? Is it not enough like \u2018Gone Girl\u2019?\u201d",
      "What is your initial writing process like?",
      "I write in my head all the time. I can\u2019t turn it off. I was writing something in my head on the way to work today, on the way to the office, that is not going to go anywhere. It was just something I was thinking about, like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s a great line. What is that? Where\u2019s that line go?\u201d It\u2019s describing a character or describing a moment or scenery.",
      "One of the walls in my office is a whiteboard. It's got whiteboard wallpaper just entirely on it, which is fantastic for a writer. But it looks like the scribblings of a mad woman because I just write different ideas for different projects. People will look at it and it really does look like a crazy person because it's all over.",
      "Do you still write down those random ideas?",
      "Yeah. I\u2019ll probably never remember where it\u2019s at or to look at it. But every once in a while I do go like, \u201cAh, I wrote that down somewhere.\u201d But I\u2019m like, \u201cDid I write in my email? Did I write on my wall. Is it in a notebook?\u201d",
      "What does the rewriting process look like for you?",
      "I loop around and rewrite a little bit as I go. But my aim is generally to get a crappy first draft. And that's what I would tell anyone who wants to be a writer because you're never going to know what's wrong with your story until you have a really crappy first draft. And then don't be afraid of it. You can go back and see what's wrong.",
      "Then I rewrite and I rewrite and I rewrite. I mean, I love rewriting. That's when I get happy. That's my happy spot. Though, writing the actual opening draft is terrifying \u2014 and it's suspenseful because you really don't know where you're going.",
      "At what point do you let people read?",
      "Not until it\u2019s done. Third or fourth draft. I want to make sure that I\u2019m writing the book I want to write. I think you give it to people early on, and they\u2019re telling you, \u201cOh, I could do this.\u201d Even if you really respect them, and it\u2019s a great idea, it\u2019s not what I want. It\u2019s really hard to get to a point where you say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to you to tell me what I should do here.\u201d",
      "So I figure it all out. I get it in really, really good shape. And then I give it to my husband, first and foremost. He\u2019s an amazing reader and editor, basically. And then I give it to a very small circle of friends \u2014 very small, like, two.",
      "Have you ever made major changes after hearing feedback?",
      "I will admit, I give it to people and I change very little afterwards. I\u2019ll listen, though. My husband will say something like, \u201cThis scene is cool. It goes on a little long.\u201d OK, yeah.",
      "I take it back \u2014 for \u201cDark Places,\u201d he did give me some criticism. I made big changes on that one. But for the most part, it\u2019s more, \u201cThis seemed to go on too long. Make your point. Should I move along from this?\u201d That sort of thing.",
      "Do you have any advice for writers navigating the world of publishing right now?",
      "Whatever you do, don't chase what seems popular right now. It's very tempting. It may pay off, but you're still always going to be the knockoff of someone else. You're going to be the, \"If you like so and so, you'll like this person.\" And how much do you want to be that? Do you want to have your own voice? That's why you're writing. So even though the market is tighter, the great voices do get found. It may take a little longer, but it's about unique, interesting, great writing.",
      "When I did \u201cSharp Objects,\u201d we got rejected quite a bit. At that time, it was sort of strange. People always said women don\u2019t want to read about dark women, and we proved that wrong. Might take more. Might take a little longer. But it\u2019ll get there if you have a bold and unique voice. Those are the ones that usually make it through the clutter of all the imitators.",

      "\u201cI think Willie (Geist) is one of the most amazing interviewers,\u201d Sara Hamlin, a longtime fan and Chicago resident tells TODAY.com at a reception ahead of Willie\u2019s Sunday Sitdown Live with guest Ina Garten on May 19. \u201cHe\u2019s just different than any other interviewer, and Ina is one of my favorite chefs.\u201d",
      "Along with her husband Scott, Hamlin flew into New York City just to see Willie speak with his friend Garten at City Winery at Pier 57.",
      "\u201cShe made me feel like I could actually cook,\u201d Sara says of the Barefoot Contessa, adding that she regularly makes her roast chicken recipe. \u201cIt\u2019s a bucket list for me to be here to see two of my favorite people. We\u2019ve never seen her in person before.\u201d",
      "And the Hamlins aren\u2019t the only far-flung fans to make the trip to the event.",
      "\u201cThe one thing that I do is rosemary lemon chicken,\u201d Luz Rivera, who traveled from St. Pete, Florida, tells TODAY.com of her go-to recipe: Garten\u2019s Tuscan Lemon Chicken.",
      "\u201cNails it!\u201d Simeon Pappas, her husband, chimes in. \u201cWhen she makes that, there\u2019s no chicken left at the end between the two of us, not when we have five friends over, either.\u201d",
      "Other folks in attendance from Dallas, Texas, San Diego, California and other stretches of the U.S. dressed to the nines in sparkly skirt-sets, pearl-embroidered collars, Garten-esque scarves and denim to see the woman who personifies simple comfort, at least according to Tina Fey on \u201c30 Rock.\u201d",
      "Fans from as far as Canada made the journey to see Willie and Garten chat and do a short cooking demo, too \u2014 a kind of dedication that our host finds thrilling.",
      "\u201cIt still blows me away,\u201d Willie tells TODAY.com backstage. \u201cThese people out there feel strongly and passionately about our show, so let\u2019s bring them into the room.\u201d",
      "Garten walked onstage to Eartha Kitt\u2019s \u201cC\u2019est Si Bon\u201d to an audience of more than 500 fans, who gave the francophile a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cLove the music,\u201d Garten said with a smile.",
      "\u201cYes, right? Little French music for Ina,\u201d Willie replied, to laughter from everyone in the room.",
      "During their sitdown, Garten spoke with Willie about her memoir \u201cBe Ready When the Luck Happens,\u201d dinner party no-nos, her relationship with husband Jeffrey and her Food Network show \u201cBe My Guest,\u201d which has welcomed such names as Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jennifer Garner and Stanley Tucci.",
      "\u201cThe list of people who sort of make the pilgrimage to your barn is amazing,\u201d Willie said, before asking if she had a dream guest. The crowd listened in rapt attention \u2014 and Garten didn\u2019t hesitate with her answer.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d she said to cheers and applause.",
      "Garten and Swift have become close over the years, sharing mutual admiration. The cookbook author has previously shared that she first met the 14-time Grammy winner at TODAY. Later, their budding friendship was cemented when Food Network Magazine asked musicians who their favorite Food Network cooks were.",
      "\u201cTaylor chose me, which was so sweet,\u201d Garten said.",
      "Garten added that Swift has been to the barn \u2014 the Contessa\u2019s nickname for her East Hampton home \u2014 about 10 years ago, and they spent time in her kitchen.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t wanna just stand there and take pictures of her,\u201d Garten said with a chuckle. \u201cI wanted to cook with her.\u201d",
      "She said she asked Swift\u2019s longtime publicist Tree Paine what the pop star likes to eat and was told the \u201cBlank Space\u201d singer\u2019s favorites are Garten\u2019s mustard-roasted fish, filet of beef and date nut spice bread, but Garten ultimately decided against those options.",
      "\u201cA friend of mine said, \u2018That doesn\u2019t sound like Taylor Swift, that sounds like a Ukrainian grandmother,\u2019\u201d Garten said to laughter. \u201cI was, like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re not gonna make any of those things.\u2019\u201d",
      "Instead, Garten decided to make pavlova. Her recipe tosses blueberries, raspberries and strawberries in a framboise-spiked berry sauce over a big meringue base.",

      "Rob McElhenney says he\u2019s considering switching to a shorter last name.",
      "The \"It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" star \u2014 who also co-owns the Wrexham A.F.C football team with Ryan Reynolds \u2014\u00a0 told Variety he wants to swap his notoriously challenging surname for one that's easier to pronounce.",
      "The decision, he said, coincides with his multimedia company, More Better Industries, increasing its global investments, which now includes soccer teams in Colombia and Mexico.",
      "\"As our business and our storytelling is expanding into other regions of the world and other languages in which my name is even harder to pronounce, I\u2019m just going by Rob Mac,\u201d he said.",
      "The actor told the publication he initially worried that a name change might be considered disrespectful to his Irish ancestry. That is, until he discovered others in his family had changed the name over the years.",
      "Last month, family members who celebrated his birthday with McElhenney confided they, too, were interested in a name change.",
      "Olson, who tied the knot with McElhenney in 2008, told Variety she and the couple's sons \u2014 Axel Lee, 14, and Leo Grey, 13 \u2014\u00a0weren't sure what to make of the idea.",
      "\u201cThe kids are really not happy about it, because they have that last name ... And so do I, legally!\" she said.",
      "\"Mac\" wouldn\u2019t be all that hard for fans and people in McElhenney\u2019s orb to remember. After all, he plays a pub co-owner named Mac on \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny\u201d and also co-owns a bar in Philadelphia, Mac\u2019s Tavern, in real life with wife and \"Sunny\" co-star Kaitlin Olson.",
      "McElhenney\u2019s name-swap idea comes more than two years after his prankster pal Reynolds created a music video for the actor\u2019s birthday to teach fans how to say his last name.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Mackle-Henney, it\u2019s Mackle-Henney,\u201d Reynolds sings along with a roster of guest stars, including Olson and then-Philadelphia Eagle center Jason Kelce.",

But tucked inside all that research is something more personal: a peek into the thoughts of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner's eldest child.",
      "According to Violet, Garner was \u201cshell-shocked, astonished, at the scale of destruction\u201d wrought by the wildfires in the neighborhood where she is raising her family. Garner, 53, and Affleck, who divorced in 2018, are also parents to Fin, 16, and Samuel, 13.",
      "\u201cI was surprised at her surprise: as a lifelong Angelena and climate-literate member of generation Z, my question had not been whether the Palisades would burn but when,\u201d Violet wrote.",
      "The January, 2025 fires in the Los Angeles area killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes.",

      "In 2024, Violet delivered a passionate speech at a Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meeting, pushing back against proposed mask bans in public spaces and healthcare settings. She spoke from personal experience, having dealt with a post-viral condition herself, and stressed how serious and long-lasting the effects of viral infections can be, especially for vulnerable communities.",
      "Violet also has a knack for language. When dad Ben Affleck appeared on TODAY in April, he described Violet as a \"student of Spanish.\" He studied the subject at the University of Vermont.",

Moore also founded DNA Detectives, which helps people connect with their biological families \u2014 no \"Finding Your Roots\" needed.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Moore explained that much of her work doesn\u2019t make the episode. Each \u201cBook of Life\u201d takes hundreds of hours to create. The show tapes Gates\u2019 presentation of the book for about four hours \u2014 and the final edit is a fraction of that.",
      "Below, Moore shares more notable discoveries throughout her decade on \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "Henry Louis Gates Jr.",
      "Gates simultaneously asked Moore to work on his family secret that he\u2019d learned about at age nine, which Moore would be tasked with working on for the next decade. It culminated in one of the most satisfying \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d discoveries for Moore in the show\u2019s history, causing Gates to tear up during the filming while Moore hosted in Gates\u2019 place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so meaningful because his original family mystery is really what sparked all of this,\u201d Moore told TODAY.com in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t know if finding your roots would even exist if he hadn\u2019t been so intrigued with that mystery.\u201d",
      "The findings of the mystery, uncovered in the season 11 finale of the show, revealed the life surrounding Gates\u2019 great-great-grandmother Jane Gates, uncovering the husband of Jane Gates as well as estate papers showing her listed in slave records along with her two sons.",
      "Moore, who spent over a decade working on the project, learned the identity of Gates\u2019 great-great-grandfather Charles Wesley Kelly in 2017 thanks to the growth of public DNA databases online. Despite finding the identity of Kelly, she wanted to provide Gates with a full spectrum of information on his family tree.",
      "\u201cTrying to give my friend and my colleague information that would be valuable and meaningful to him, it was pretty daunting,\u201d Moore laughs.",
      "The result was worth the wait; Moore uncovered over 300 of Jane Gates\u2019 descendants who gathered for a Gates family reunion, a full-circle moment for the \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d host.",
      "LL Cool J",

      "Moore later discovered LL Cool J\u2019s mother, Ondrea Griffith, was adopted, meaning that the rapper was not related to his grandparents.",
      "LL Cool J was raised in his grandparents\u2019 house after his father, James Nunya, shot his mother and grandfather. Though they both survived, LL Cool J found the two wounded on the floor, a traumatic experience for the rapper, which he wrote about in his memoir.",
      "\u201cThat was tremendously concerning, because it\u2019s not something we would surprise him with on camera. That would not be kind,\u201d Moore recalls about the discovery.",
      "Ahead of filming, Gates called LL Cool J to see if he wanted to proceed, as is the show\u2019s policy. He insisted he wanted to discuss it on camera, and his mother agreed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little devastating to know that the guy that raised me, the guy that was so kind to me, wasn\u2019t my blood,\u201d LL Cool J said during the episode.",
      "Moore compared Griffith\u2019s DNA to a database of millions of available samples and found a match with a half sister named Claudia Lewis, sharing 24.7% matching DNA, which led to the discovery of LL Cool J\u2019s biological grandfather, Nathaniel Christy Lewis.",
      "Moore also discovered LL Cool J\u2019s maternal grandmother, a woman named Ethel Mae Jolly, quickly learning that Jolly was still alive in her late 80s.",
      "Moore told TODAY.com that LL Cool J and his mom ended up meeting Jolly, saying that the rapper took his grandmother \u201cunder his wing.\u201d",

      "Looking back, Moore says \u201cadoptees really gained a lot from watching that episode.\u201d",

      "Joe Manganiello",
      "Moore says actor Joe Manganiello \"has the richest, most varied, intricate family history\" she's ever worked on.",
      "During the episode, Manganiello discovered his great-grandfather was a German soldier, unearthed what his family endured during the Armenian genocide and learned he had Black ancestry.",
      "Manganiello\u2019s great-grandmother on his mother\u2019s side, Terviz \u201cRose\u201d Darakjian, was a survivor of the Armenian genocide. Nearly all of her family was killed, including her husband, parents and seven of her eight children.",
      "Using DNA evidence, Moore discovered Manganiello's grandmother became pregnant by a German soldier in a refugee camp after fleeing during the Armenian genocide.",
      "Then, on his father's side, DNA evidence revealed that Manganiello showed no genetic relation to the man he assumed to be his father\u2019s father. Manganiello\u2019s father had no idea he was not raised by his biological father, but agreed to share the findings on the PBS show.",
      "Manganiello eventually learned his biological paternal grandfather was of African American descent.",
      "Moore says that the countless discoveries made in the episode inspired Mangianello to continue research after the show, the first guest to become invested in genealogy afterwards.",
      "\u201cHe talked at one point like, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll quit being an actor and I\u2019ll become a genetic genealogist.\u2019 That\u2019s how much he loved it,\u201d Moore says"

      "The Chicago native appeared multiple times in the recurring \u201cDa Bears\u201d sketch on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d in which a group of blindly devoted Chicago Bears fans, decked out in Bears gear, dark sunglasses and thick mustaches, discuss the team on a talk show, with many conversations punctuated by them saying \u201cDa Bears!\u201d in a thick Chicago accent.",
      "Officially known as \u201cBill Swerski\u2019s Super Fans,\u201d the sketch was a staple of \u201cSNL\u201d in the early 1990s, featuring the actors making outlandish predictions that the Bears will win games by completely unrealistic scores, their confidence oozing like the juices from the kielbasa they scarf down on the daily.",
      "Wendt, as Bob Swerski, would open the sketch, with cigar in hand, by casually announcing he\u2019s filling in for his brother, Bill, who suffered another heart attack. The panelists, of course, are surrounded by artery-clogging foods on the table around them; a heart attack is as natural a byproduct as quenching their thirst with a beer after eating the caloric explosion of cuisine set before them.",
      "Joined by Robert Smigel \u2014 who created the sketch \u2014 Mike Myers and Chris Farley, the quartet live on the fringe of reality.

      "In another episode, the crew quickly discusses how many heart attacks they had that week before guest host Macaulay Culkin reenacts the first Thanksgiving, which somehow features his absurd pick for how badly the Bears will beat the Lions when they play during the holiday.",
      "Smigel came up with the premise of the sketch after seeing fans at Chicago Cubs games and Chicago White Sox games after he moved to the Windy City in the early 1980s.",
      "\u201cThey just had this swagger to them and I just, in my head, I was like, \u2018Da Bears!\u2019\u201d Smigel once told Antenna TV.",
      "\u201cThere was just a swagger among these very virile-looking men,\u201d he told The Ringer in 2018. \u201cAll sports fans kind of have it. The arrogance of, \u2018We kicked your ass!\u2019 No, you didn\u2019t. You\u2019re a fat guy sitting in the third row. You can barely make it to the bathroom with all the beers you\u2019ve drunk. You didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d",
      "Joe Mantegna appeared in the sketch the first time it aired. Wendt would step in for the second sketch later in 1991, a point in which Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls began their run of six NBA titles that decade. That marked a turning point for the sketch.",
      "\u201cAfter Wendt joined in, the Super Fans were officially recurring characters,\u201d wrote The Ringer. \u201cThat summer at a\u00a0Comic Relief event\u00a0in Chicago, the group appeared in a sketch with Michael Jordan.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what led to him feeling comfortable hosting\u00a0\u2018Saturday Night Live,\u2019\u201d Smigel told the website. Indeed, Jordan did host the show\u2019s 17th-season premiere in September 1991.",
      "The sketch was a stalwart in the \u201890s, but lived on in the years afterward, too, with Wendt reprising his role on multiple occasions.",
      "Sports and \u201cSNL\u201d have a storied history, and Wendt may have played a small role in the show\u2019s 50-year history, as well as more modern history. After Chicago native Robert Prevost was elected the new pope and became Pope Leo XIV earlier this month, the hashtag #DaPope popped up on X.",

      "\"At 25, desperately wanting to be a mom and it just not happening has been truly one of the most unimaginable things I\u2019ve ever had to endure ... That was all so much to witness.\"",
      "\"I know Demi is not a fan favorite right now but this broke my heart.\"",
      "\"As someone who has battled infertility for four years as well, this gutted me. I wanted to hug her so hard.\"",
      "On the show, Taylor breezed into frame with a bag of drug store pregnancy tests. \"I have a surprise! We're going to play a little game for breakfast. We're going to play pregnancy roulette!\" she said. (Taylor's period was late so rather than taking a test in private, she decided to make everyone take a test in the most public way possible.)",
      "\"This is a cruel prank because what if someone is and it's not me?\" Demi Engemann, who had been struggling with infertility for four years, said before playing the game. \"This isn't traumatic at all. I don't cry every single time I take a test and get a negative,\" she added sarcastically.",
      "In a confessional interview, Engemann said, \"I feel like I'm going to throw up. It's evoking all of these emotions in me and triggering me to my core. My least favorite thing to do is take a pregnancy test.\"",
      "Yet for some reason, all of the women agreed to play the game.",
      "Taylor and Mayci Neely happened to grab tests with negative results. Mikayla Matthews selected a pregnancy test that happened to be positive. But none of the women confessed to being pregnant. Then it was Engemann's turn to select a pregnancy test from the bowl.",
      "When she spotted the result, Engemann gasped, took a huge step back, covered her face with her arm and began to sob. The test was positive. But she knew it wasn't hers.",
      "In a confessional interview, Engemann described how unsettling it was to look at a positive pregnancy test.",
      "Though she asked for the pregnant women to reveal themselves, Matthews and Neely (who had previously announced their pregnancies on social media) remained silent.",
      "This situation was \"the exact opposite\" of how Neely said she wanted to reveal her pregnancy to the group.",
      "\"This is also my moment that I don't want to be taken away from me, and I also want to be sensitive to how (Demi is) feeling,\" Matthews said.",
      "Engemann's \"frenemy\" on the show, Jessi Ngatikaura, consoled her as she sobbed. Eventually Matthews and Neely joined the pair and confessed that they were pregnant. Engemann ended up apologizing for her negative reaction to their positive tests.",
      "In her press interview, Taylor tells TODAY.com that she spent time with Engemann afterward to try to console her, but the scene was edited out of the final episode.",
      "\"They didn't show me in the bathroom, both of us crying and me consoling her and being like, 'I'm so sorry that this just happened. I feel awful. I'm so, so sorry,\" Taylor explains. \"A lot of things are definitely taken out of context.\""

    "summary": "The \"Norm!\" greeting on \"Cheers\" and George Wendt's jokes that followed helped make the show the success it was. TODAY.com looks back following Wendt's death.",
    "story": [
      "One word can have such an impact.",
      "\u201cCheers\u201d star George Wendt, who died May 20 at the age of 76, left behind a legacy in the annals of TV comedy that is hard to equal, thanks to one word: Norm.",
      "Norm was the embodiment of the show's well-known theme song about a place \u201cwhere everybody knows your name and they\u2019re always glad you came.\u201d",
      "An alum of Chicago's Second City comedy troupe, Wendt, who played the perpetually underachieving barfly Norm Peterson on the classic sitcom, was one of the strings that held the show together. He was an accountant by trade, but a loyal patron of the bar, first and foremost, a man whose love for the watering hole superseded his career and his marriage to his never-seen-on-camera wife, Vera.",
      "Norm was the everyman, literally always at the ready with a joke. And nowhere was that more evident than when he walked into the bar. As Cheers\u2019 most frequent and dedicated customer, Norm was always greeted by other customers and workers with a buoyant \u201cNorm!\u201d when he entered, providing a monosyllabic setup for the joke to follow.",
      "There is no shortage of witty lines.",
      "\u201cWhat are you up to, Norm?\u201d Sam, played by Ted Danson, asks in one episode.",
      "\u201cMy ideal weight, if I were 11 feet tall,\u201d he quickly shoots back.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Mr. Peterson,\u201d Woody Harrelson\u2019s na\u00efve Woody asks him in another episode.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s talk about what\u2019s going in Mr. Peterson,\u201d he nonchalantly replies.",
      "\u201cHey, what\u2019s happening, Norm?\u201d Sam once innocently asks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a dog-eat-dog world, Sammy, and I\u2019m wearing Milk Bone underwear,\u201d he casually responds as he saunters to his bar stool.",
      "The premise initially appeared in the show\u2019s pilot.",
      "\u201cGeorge Wendt entered for the first time and said, \u2018Afternoon, everybody!\u2019\u201d \u201cCheers\u201d co-creator and longtime director, James Burrows, wrote in his 2022 book, \u201cDirected by James Burrows.\u201d \u201cAnd, of course, everybody yelled back, \u2018Norm!\u2019 Then Teddy said, \u2018What do you know?\u2019 And George said, \u2018Not enough.\u2019\u201d",
      "In that moment, a recurring bit was born.",
      "\u201cIt was really a straight line in the script, but it got this huge laugh from the audience,\u201d Burrows continued. \u201cI turned to my two partners and said, \u2018Wow, they\u2019re laughing not only at this joke but they\u2019re laughing at this character, the person saying it.\u2019 Right then I had a sense that we had something special.\u201d",
      "\u201cCheers,\u201d which was nominated for a staggering 117 Emmy Awards and won 28, never lost its luster over its 11-year run, even as cast changes challenged its dynamic. \u201cNorm!\u201d was a constant, a warm blanket for viewers looking for laughs.",
      "\u201cNorm!\u201d became a signature greeting that Burrows said was created by Nicholas Colasanto, who played Coach on the show before his death prior to the fourth season. It was simple, effective and eventually, daunting to write.",
      "\u201cWe wound up with ten of the greatest seconds of sitcom history each week, every time Norm walked in and made a joke,\u201d Burrows wrote. \u201cThe Norm\u2019isms \u2014 the interchange when Norm walks into the bar in each episode \u2014 became harder and harder to write, because the audience expected so much.\u201d",
      "\u201cCheers\u201d was an escape from the daily travails and aggravation of life. Norm was the poster child.",
      "\u201cEvery character wanted something or had some kind of problem, except for Norm, who was wonderful and essential in a different way, because he was the anchor for the group,\u201d Burrows wrote. \u201cBecause Norm was relatively happy and well-adjusted, everything was fine.\u201d",
      "Wendt\u2019s portrayal of Norm earned him six Emmy nominations, although he never won. It was a career-defining role for a man who took to comedy the way Norm took to beer. He enjoyed other success, including a recurring role on \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch.\u201d He also appeared in his own short-lived series, \u201cThe George Wendt Show,\u201d and had multiple uncredited appearances on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in the popular \u201cSuper Fans\u201d sketches, which wrought the phrase \u201cDa Bears!\u201d in the early 1990s.",
      "He even had supporting roles in \u201880s movies such as \u201cFletch\u201d and \u201cGung Ho\u201d and once even shared a screen with Macaulay Culkin in Michael Jackson\u2019s heavily hyped video for \u201cBlack or White.\u201d He was  also the uncle to comedy star Jason Sudeikis.",
      "Wendt was just plain funny, a linchpin in a \u201cCheers\u201d cast that was a linchpin in NBC\u2019s vaunted Thursday night lineup that featured hits like \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d \u201cFamily Ties\u201d and \u201cNight Court.\u201d There are no words to explain how valuable he was \u2014 except one: Norm."

    "story": [
      "Aid workers struggling to distribute a trickle of aid entering the besieged Gaza Strip are describing a logistical \u201cnightmare\u201d in the midst of a spiraling humanitarian crisis.",
      "\u201cWith this limited amount of aid, the humanitarian situation continues to get worse and worse,\u201d Dr. Amjad Alshawa, director of the Palestinian NGOs Network, an umbrella group of Palestinian organizations, told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cAt the same time, the Israelis are imposing restrictions on access to these supplies.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said humanitarian workers were able to pick up at least 90 truckloads of aid Wednesday night \u2014 but it was unclear whether that aid had been distributed as of Thursday morning.",
      "Meanwhile, NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground described widespread frustration among Palestinians waiting to see whether more aid will flow into the enclave. Many charities have stopped or reduced their food offerings because of the scarcity of supplies and high cost of the rare goods available at markets.",
      "After lifting its almost three-month-long blockade of the entry of food, medicine and other aid into Gaza, Israel has allowed a trickle of supplies into the enclave in recent days amid mounting international pressure. Aid groups say it has also imposed a new set of rules on bringing in supplies, which they blame for logistical snarl-ups and a delay in food and medicine reaching those who need it.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military\u2019s liaison with the Palestinians, said Thursday that 198 trucks had entered Gaza, but did not specifically comment on the new procedures and referred NBC News to the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for further comment, which it did not immediately provide.",
      "COGAT data suggested the majority of that aid has been food, with medicine and medical equipment making up a smaller share.",
      "Humanitarian groups have warned that the limited aid flowing in is a fraction of the amount needed, with an average of around 500 trucks a day entering in Gaza before the war, according to the British Red Cross.",
      "Despite that resumption, little if any aid entering Gaza had reached Palestinian civilians as of late Wednesday, with humanitarian groups saying that new procedures introduced by Israel have complicated an already tangled effort.",
      "Logistical 'nightmare'",
      "In a briefing Wednesday, St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said that in one instance, the rules meant that, \u201cIsraeli authorities had only allowed our teams to go through one area that was highly congested, that we felt was insecure and where we felt looting was highly likely to take place, given the prolonged deprivation in Gaza.\u201d",
      "While Israeli authorities have not specifically laid out what the new rules involve, Dujarric said Tuesday that humanitarian workers were being required to offload supplies on the Palestinian side of the Kerem Shalom crossing and then reload them separately once teams inside Gaza were allowed to collect them.",
      "He noted that one team waited \"several hours\" for such a green light but was never able to transport the goods.",
      "Meanwhile, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, has found many of its trucks \u201cblocked for reasons that are sometimes unknown,\u201d its head of mission for the Palestinian Territories, Jean Guy Vataux, told NBC News in Jerusalem late Wednesday.",
      "While he added that some of the new procedures were \u201cput in place to avoid smuggling,\u201d the new system \u201cturns into a logistic nightmare for the agencies.\u201d",
      "'Malnutrition is growing'",
      "Meanwhile, \"malnutrition is growing\" in Gaza, Vataux said.",
      "An Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, report released earlier this month warned of the risk of famine if adequate access to food was not restored.",
      "The IPC snapshot warned that some 470,000 people in Gaza were facing \u201ccatastrophic hunger,\u201d while the entire population was experiencing food insecurity, the World Food Programme said. It further projected that an \u201calarming 71,000 children and more than 17,000 mothers\u201d would need \u201curgent treatment for acute malnutrition.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the U.N. clarified comments from its humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who had said some 14,000 babies were at risk of death within a short time frame. The body said that the same number of babies is facing severe malnutrition absent a significant and swift increase of aid into Gaza, with severe malnutrition posing the risk of death."

      "After maulings for Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and King Abdullah of Jordan, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa may have just shown other world leaders how to prepare for President Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office bear pit.",
      "Historically, these White House sit-downs were dull affairs, replete with grip-and-grin platitudes and geopolitical jargon. Not so during the second term of Trump, who has transformed his office into a gladiatorial arena.",
      "There was February\u2019s stunning bust-up by Vice President JD Vance against Zelenskyy. The same month, Abdullah could not hide his chagrin as Trump spoke at length about his plans to take control of the Gaza Strip.",
      "So, South Africa's Ramaphosa seemed unsurprised when Trump ambushed him Wednesday \u2014 the U.S. president even dimmed the lights for a screening of news clips alleging that white farmers are victims of a genocide in South Africa.",
      "Most experts agree this is a false, baseless claim, seized upon by Trump since employing as an adviser the South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, who was in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible sight \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it,\u201d Trump commentated while the footage played.",
      "Unlike other leaders, Ramaphosa \u2014 a former trade union leader and ally of Nelson Mandela who helped end apartheid \u2014 was clearly prepared. He spoke calmly and without interruption, politely but firmly disagreeing with Trump.",
      "\u201cIt will take President Trump listening to the voices of South Africans, some of whom are his good friends,\u201d he said, when asked what would convince the American leader he was mistaken.",
      "And there was a flourish of his own.",
      "Ramaphosa had brought with him Ernie Els and Retief Goosen, two white South African golfers who are both in the Hall of Fame and have won six U.S. Open titles between them.",
      "At a meeting alongside the golf-fanatic Trump, the intention behind the maneuver was unmistakable.",
      "\u201cIf there was Afrikaner farmer genocide, I can bet you these three gentlemen would not be here,\u201d the South African leader said in the Oval Office, pointing to the white members of his entourage that also included John Steenhuisen, his agriculture minister. \u201cIt will take him, President Trump, listening to their stories, to their perspective.\u201d",
      "Whereas the Zelenskyy fiasco caught \u201ceveryone off guard with its intensity and its destructiveness,\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cplanned attack\u201d on Ramaphosa \u201ctook the stakes up a level,\u201d said Scott Lucas, a politics professor at Ireland\u2019s University College Dublin.",
      "\u201cRamaphosa seemed to have been very well briefed and he kept his cool,\u201d he said. \u201cLeaders around the world now have a playbook for how they deal with Trump.\u201d",
      "This is not to say other leaders have not had similar successes already.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer unfurled from his breast pocket a letter from King Charles III when he came to town in February \u2014 a gambit mocked back in Britain for being sycophantic, but one that seemed to go down well with Trump.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba huddled with advisers for more than 20 hours of preparatory meetings ahead of his showdown the same month, a person familiar with the planning said. That too seemed to pay off: Ishiba arrived armed with charts clearly and colorfully illustrating Japan\u2019s investments in America and the kind of visual aids that Trump prefers.",
      "Like Starmer, he played to Trump\u2019s appetite for a theatrical gift, bringing with him a golden samurai helmet, which in Japan often signifies prayers for prosperity and longevity.",
      "Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron appears to have mastered the art of keeping a rapport with Trump while maintaining a macho-style resistance to some of his statements. During his own February Oval Office sit-down, he put his hand on Trump\u2019s arm and gently corrected his mistaken statement that European countries had merely \u201cloaned\u201d money to Ukraine.",
      "Even more stern, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney kept a straight back, clenched jaw and \u2014 though often struggling to get a word in edgewise \u2014 made it clear through words and firm hand gestures that \u201cCanada is not for sale.\u201d",
      "Even against this field, Ramaphosa\u2019s poise has been widely praised.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing preparing to be ambushed and another being able to manage the situation,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy at England\u2019s University of Birmingham.",
      "\u201cMost people seem to think that Ramaphosa came out of it well,\u201d he added. \u201cThat may also be because he has good people skills, which meant that he was better placed than some world leaders to defuse the situation.\u201d",
      "However artful a sparring partner Ramaphosa was, it's still unclear how effective his tactics will be.",
      "\u201cYou wanted to see drama and something really big happening,\u201d Ramaphosa told reporters afterward, downplaying the episode. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that we disappointed you somewhat when it comes to that.\u201d",
      "But it was still a bruising and concerning encounter for a country that dearly needs American financial help.",
      "Hours before the Oval Office meeting, South African Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana said his government did not have the necessary funds to cover a $430 million shortfall caused by Trump\u2019s cuts to foreign aid.",
      "In Trump, the country faces a president who sees a \u201cperfect trifecta\u201d in the white farmer genocide claim, Patrick Gaspard, a former U.S. ambassador to South Africa, told MSNBC later Wednesday.",
      "It allows Trump \u201cto play to a domestic political audience that is obsessed with white, existential threats,\u201d while distracting from domestic economic issues and promoting Musk\u2019s attempts to get a South African license for Starlink, Gaspard said.",
      "He called the encounter not only \u201cdeeply offensive and hurtful to a partnership that we have with a really important nation in sub-Saharan Africa,\u201d but also said it \u201cdoes a major disservice to that Oval Office, that sacred space.\u201d",

      "Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost of Chicago, began the audience with a tour through the piazza in the popemobile and stopped to bless several babies. In addressing specific greetings to different groups of pilgrims, Leo spoke in his native English, his fluent Spanish as well as the traditional Italian of the papacy.",
      "\u201cI renew my heartfelt appeal to allow the entrance of dignified humanitarian aid to Gaza and to put an end to the hostilities whose heartbreaking price is being paid by children, the elderly and sick people,\u201d he said.",

      "The general audience on Wednesdays is a weekly appointment that popes have kept for decades to allow ordinary faithful to have a face-to-face encounter with the pontiff.

      "Edan Alexander, who was believed to be\u00a0the last living U.S. citizen\u00a0held captive in Gaza, was freed on May 12 after having been captured by Hamas during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Born in Tel Aviv, Edan, 21, grew up in New Jersey but had returned to Israel to serve in the army. His parents said he recounted to them the details of his capture and his time in captivity.",
      "Attacked on his army base on Oct. 7, Edan faced off with almost 30 militants by himself before he was kidnapped, Adi Alexander said. His son called the first year in captivity \u201ccomplete hell,\u201d he said, because he was frequently moved around to various locations above ground, underground and in tents, at one point during the war living in a tent that, his father recounted, Edan said he couldn\u2019t leave for weeks.",
      "\u201cThe conditions in those tents are not easy. They couldn\u2019t get out,\u201d Adi said, noting that Edan\u2019s time in the tent was his \u201ctoughest period\u201d in captivity.",
      "Edan was in good physical shape when he was taken, whereas a number of other captives, including injured people, children and the elderly, weren\u2019t, Adi said, so Edan helped those being held with him, especially when they moved between locations.",
      "Edan endured hunger, eating only hummus, pita bread, rice and whatever his captors served him from cans, his father said, a reflection of the food scarcity in Gaza since the start of the war. Fears of famine have heightened there in recent weeks as Israel has carried out a nearly three-month blockade on the enclave \u2014\u00a0the longest of its kind since the start of the conflict.",

      "Food began to flow more regularly during the fragile January ceasefire brokered during the Biden administration, offering the hostages an opportunity to eat meat, Adi Alexander said. Edan told his parents conditions improved during what Adi called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of his son's captivity \u2014 after Donald Trump was elected president.",
      "By then, he said, Edan, who had lost about a quarter of his body mass, stayed in one \u201csecure and safe\u201d location for the rest of his time in Gaza and was able to regain some weight.",
      "Adi lauded his son\u2019s \u201cwisdom to get along with the captors and survive,\u201d even when death from bombardments by the Israeli army \u2014 which he said Edan described as \u201clike an earthquake\u201d \u2014 seemed possible. At one point, Edan also survived a tunnel collapse, his father said.",
      "\u201cWe consider ourselves lucky that he survived that day,\u201d Adi said of the collapse. \u201cHe has some injury from that event, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something major now.\u201d",
      "Adi said he and his family were devastated when the ceasefire collapsed and \u201cthe war re-started.\u201d",
      "On May 5, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced an intensive military operation aiming to take the whole of the Gaza Strip in an effort to eliminate Hamas, a move approved by the country\u2019s security Cabinet.",
      "But the plan hasn\u2019t been without pushback. A number of military reservists have rejected the call to serve in the operation, saying it is part of a war that has become politically motivated. At a Knesset committee\u00a0meeting this month, the father of one of the remaining hostages called on soldiers \u201cnot to report for reserve duty for moral and ethical reasons.\u201d",
      "More than 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, and around 250 hostages were taken, according to Israeli tallies. Fifty-eight hostages are believed to remain in captivity.",
      "More than 53,000 people \u2014 many of them women and children \u2014 have been killed in Gaza in the resulting war, according to health officials in the enclave, which Hamas has run since 2007.",
      "Talks to end the war have stalled, even as many Israelis urge their leaders to bring the rest of the hostages home. Adi Alexander expressed reservations about the \u201cmixed messaging.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy hope is that it\u2019s just a political posture,\u201d he said of Netanyahu's plan for an expanded military operation. \u201cMy expectation is going back to the bargaining table, rising above politics and prioritizing human life.\u201d",
      "The Alexander family knows all too well the suffering of the hostages.",
      "Yael Alexander recalled how her son said he held on to hope in captivity, thanks in part to seeing glimpses of his family on the news.",
      "\u201cHe saw us,\u201d she said. \u201cHe knew we were fighting for him.\u201d",
      "Their fight culminated on Mother\u2019s Day with a call from Steve Witkoff, Trump\u2019s\u00a0special envoy to the Middle East, who told the Alexanders that Hamas would be announcing the release of their son momentarily.",
      "Yael said she immediately packed her things and got the next flight to Israel. Adi and their other children followed on a later flight.",
      "\u201cIt was perfectly timed, and everyone was together just one time,\u201d Yael said of Edan\u2019s release. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d",
      "Despite being a bit thinner, paler and weaker, Yael said, her son is the same as before he was captured, and in their first conversation since his kidnapping, he joked that he needs a tan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same laughter, the same smile, the same kind eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is our boy.\u201d"

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that his country's military was \u201cmoving toward full control\u201d of the Gaza Strip as its intensifying airstrikes and ground operation there killed dozens more people overnight.",
      "Israeli bombardment had killed more than 300 people in the 72 hours to early Monday, the Health Authority in Gaza said. Children were among the dead after a wave of airstrikes in the southern city of Khan Younis that came even after Netanyahu said his forces would allow in limited amounts of food to avoid the risk of famine.",
      "In a statement Monday, Gaza's Hamas-run government urged the international community to pressure Israel to allow the entry of at least 500 aid trucks and 50 fuel trucks daily, adding that \u201csigns of famine and humanitarian collapse are worsening at a terrifying rate.\u201d",
      "That came after the Israeli government announced plans Sunday that, if actioned, would end its 11-week aid blockade of Gaza and allow in \u201cbasic\u201d quantities of food. Netanyahu doubled down Monday on his decision, responding on Telegram to critics from Israel\u2019s political right wing.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of criticism from the right this morning regarding the humanitarian issue \u2014 and that\u2019s understandable. But it\u2019s important to know the facts,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe must avoid a situation of famine, both in substance and in perception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf there is famine,\u201d he added, \u201cwe will lose international support and won\u2019t be able to achieve victory.\u201d",
      "That decision came even as Israel moved ahead with plans for a new ground offensive, dubbed \u201cChariots of Gideon,\u201d after its security Cabinet earlier this month unanimously approved plans to\u00a0seize all of the Gaza Strip.",
      "It was in his statement Monday that Netanyahu said that \u201cthere is intensive and large-scale military activity in Gaza\u201d and that the Israeli military was \u201cmoving toward full control of the entire Strip.\u201d",
      "Israel says the operation is aimed at defeating Hamas and ensuring the return of the remaining hostages of the 250 taken captive during the Hamas-led terrorist attacks\u00a0in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, during which around 1,200 people were killed, according to Israeli counts.",
      "The ensuing war in Gaza has killed more than 53,000 people in the enclave, Palestinian health officials say. That death toll is still rising.",
      "Those killed in airstrikes added to what has become one of\u00a0the deadliest weeks\u00a0of the conflict since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March.",
      "In a statement Monday, Hamas said that the Israeli military had launched \u201chundreds of highly destructive shells, missiles, and bombs daily, targeting residential neighborhoods and densely populated civilian areas.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that it had struck 160 of what it called \u201cterror targets\u201d in the past 24 hours.",
      "The attacks come as international aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks of the risk of famine\u00a0in Gaza after the Israeli government maintained a complete aid blockade since March 2.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a race against time to avoid famine,\u201d the United Nations' World Food Programme said in an X post Sunday, in which it urged the international community to \u201cact urgently to get aid flowing again.\u201d",
      "Those warnings have sparked alarm among even Israel\u2019s closest allies, with President Donald Trump telling reporters Friday that \u201ca lot of people are starving\u201d in Gaza.",
      "The United Nations said Monday that 92% of homes in Gaza have already been destroyed or damaged, in a post on X, adding that \u201ccountless people have been displaced multiple times, and shelter is scarce.\u201d",
      "In footage captured Sunday by NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground, Israeli missiles struck a cluster of tents sheltering displaced families in the Al-Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, killing at least 40 people and injuring dozens of others.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump's phone call with Russia's Vladimir Putin did not achieve great strides on ending the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "The phone call between President Donald Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin may not have achieved great strides on ending the war in Ukraine, but it did confirm one thing: The bromance is real. But a question is left hanging: What does this bonhomie actually deliver for the men in the Kremlin and White House?",
      "\u201cThe tone and spirit of the conversation were excellent,\u201d Trump said of his Russian counterpart after their two-hour conversation Monday, adding that Putin is a \u201cnice gentleman.\u201d Putin adviser Yuri Ushakov, meanwhile, said Trump and Putin called each other by their first names and \u201cneither of them wanted to end the conversation.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Putin commissioned a portrait of his American counterpart and delivered it to him. One of Trump\u2019s envoys, Steve Witkoff, told Tucker Carlson in March that the president was \u201cclearly touched\u201d by what he called a \u201cbeautiful\u201d portrait.",
      "Trump is not just seeking an end to the war in Ukraine, which Russia started by launching its large-scale 2022 invasion; in addition, he has made no secret of his desire to do lucrative deals with a Kremlin reintroduced to the international financial fold.",
      "In April he wrote on Truth Social that he was \u201chopeful Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,\u201d adding that \u201cboth will then start to do big business with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Before that happens, Trump and his team have suggested they want the war to end, something the president has made a clear political goal, having promised during his presidential campaign that it would take just 24 hours to secure, although he later told Time magazine that this was an \u201cexaggeration.\u201d",
      "His call with Putin appears to have brought that no closer to fruition, with a chasm still aching between Ukraine\u2019s willingness for a 30-day ceasefire and Russia\u2019s demand for Kyiv\u2019s effective surrender.",
      "It\u2019s not been a total love-in between the leaders of these former Cold War foes. Trump has expressed frustration with his Russian counterpart for continuing to launch missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians while negotiations to end the fighting are ongoing.",
      "And Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the White House is not asking the Senate to hold back on a bill that would slap a 500% tariff on imports from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and other products.",
      "But one thing that Putin\u2019s personal connection with Trump does is buy him time, according to Mark Galeotti, director of the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "Putin has shown little desire for any sort of ceasefire that does not satisfy his maximalist goals. And right now his forces continue to make slow but steady battlefield advances in eastern Ukraine, according to independent monitors like the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank.",
      "So, with negotiations at an impasse, Putin will be more than happy to delay any definite decision \u2014 on both American support for Ukraine and sanctions on Russia, Galeotti said.",
      "\u201cEvery week counts\u201d in this \u201cparticularly pivotal moment,\u201d Galeotti said. If his call with Trump delays making any decisions, then \u201cI think Putin will see it as a good job done,\u201d he said.",
      "As with its lack of detail on how the war might end, the call also provided little clarity on whether or when Trump and Putin might meet in person, something they have both suggested could happen. If and when this real-world t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate does take place, it will be harder for Putin to resist giving Trump something, according to Galeotti.",
      "The Russians are \u201ctrying to avoid giving anything because they are very, very hard-nosed negotiators,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they do meet in person, then Trump will have to leave with something.\u201d",
      "While no date for a meeting between the two leaders has been set, their longtime fondness has long caused widespread alarm across the West. Intelligence agencies see Putin as a foe who has challenged international norms through hybrid warfare such as cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against democratic institutions.",
      "Asked for a response to these criticisms, White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in an email that \u201cunlike his predecessor, President Trump is willing to look anyone in the eye and negotiate deals that deliver peace.\u201d",
      "Kelly said that \u201cthanks to his leadership\u201d Russia and Ukraine \u201cwill begin ceasefire talks to stop the killing in the bloodiest European war since World War II.\u201d A date and venue for ceasefire talks has not been set.",
      "The American president\u2019s connection with Putin has roots at least as far back as 2013, when he visited Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant and pondered on Twitter whether Putin will \u201cbecome my new best friend?\u201d",
      "By 2015, before the two men had even met, Putin was heaping praise on Trump as a \u201ccolorful, talented person,\u201d something the American leader said was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d coming from the \u201chighly respected\u201d Russian leader.",
      "A year later, Trump openly urged Putin to influence the American presidential election, telling a rally in Doral, Florida, that \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\u201d This was in the eyes of many observers an overt invitation for Russian intelligence services to hack into the account of his opponent, Hillary Clinton.",
      "Putin would indeed conduct a campaign to interfere, according to a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released in 2020.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, the pair met on multiple occasions without any staff present, a highly unusual departure from standard protocol. But the Russian government would ultimately conclude that while the president himself was friendly, his administration was not. The Trump White House imposed sanctions and withdrew from a nuclear deal it said Russia wasn\u2019t respecting.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s second term looks like it could be a repeat.",
      "Asked about future opportunities for face-to-face diplomacy between himself Putin, Trump replied: \u201cWe have to meet. He and I will meet. I think we\u2019ll solve it, or maybe not.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Young people in Taiwan are used to living with uncertainty when it comes to China \u2014 a situation they generally say is for the best for the time being, particularly when recent actions by the Trump administration have some of them asking a certain question.",
      "\u201cCan Taiwan continue to view the U.S. as an ally?\u201d said Chan Yu-hsiang, 25, a graduate student at National Taiwan University.",
      "Chan\u2019s question reflects growing concern in Taiwan over the reliability of the U.S. as a security partner under President Donald Trump, who has expressed support for the Beijing-claimed island in the face of Chinese military threats but also made critical remarks and upended trade relations.",
      "In a Taiwan government poll released in March, the percentage of respondents who said the U.S. military would \u201cdefinitely\u201d intervene in the event of a Chinese invasion dropped to 14% from 19% a year earlier. Almost half of respondents said the U.S. military was unlikely to intervene, the same as a poll by the Brookings Institution conducted the same month.",
      "According to the same Taiwan government poll, 36% of respondents said U.S.-Taiwan relations would get worse under Trump, a 12% increase since January.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s rising wariness toward the U.S. comes amid growing pressure from China, which claims the self-governing democracy as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force in achieving its unification goal. Beijing sends warplanes and ships toward the island on near-daily sorties.",
      "Last month, the Chinese military conducted large-scale drills around Taiwan in what it said was a warning to \u201cseparatist\u201d forces. The Taiwan government has warned that Beijing could hold more drills in the coming days as the island marks one year under President Lai Ching-te, whom China describes as a \u201cseparatist\u201d and \u201ctroublemaker.\u201d",
      "China has rebuffed multiple offers of talks from Lai, who says only Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people can decide its future. Beijing insists the island\u2019s future is \u201cby no means an \u2018internal affair of Taiwan,\u2019\u201d warning that Taiwanese authorities would \u201csuffer an apocalypse\u201d if they sought formal independence.",
      "Strategic ambiguity",
      "The U.S. has no formal relations with Taiwan but is its most important international backer, bound by law to provide it with defensive weapons. On Monday, Taiwan test-fired for the first time a new rocket system provided by the U.S. that Ukraine has also used against Russia.",
      "Washington has long maintained a policy of \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d when it comes to whether the U.S. military would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, not giving a definitive answer either way.",
      "Trump has not given any indication of a change in that policy. But he has unnerved Taiwan with comments accusing it of stealing semiconductor business from the U.S. and calling for Taiwan to pay more for its own defense, which it has pledged to do.",
      "Last month, he also slapped Taiwan with a 32% tariff on its goods, with an exemption for the chip industry, which makes up a big part of the Taiwan economy and which the U.S. relies on heavily.",
      "Taiwan has said it will not retaliate against the U.S. and that it is ready for trade talks \u201cat any time,\u201d offering a package of zero tariffs on American goods and increased U.S. investment.",
      "The duties came as a surprise to Taiwan after state-backed chipmaker TSMC announced a plan in March to invest an additional $100 million in the U.S., where it is already building multiple factories.",
      "For Chan, this suggested that even Taiwan\u2019s \u201csilicon shield\u201d \u2014 the semiconductor industry that makes the island so indispensable to the global economy \u2014 is not enough to guarantee U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIf you keep giving away Taiwan\u2019s last line of defense, the U.S. will take advantage of it, but they won\u2019t necessarily treat you well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhy would Taiwan still believe that Trump would definitely deploy troops if it was to fall?\u201d",
      "Maintaining the status quo",
      "Though some U.S. officials and Taiwan\u2019s military point to 2027 \u2014 the 100th anniversary of the founding of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 as a possible timeline for China to attack, polls show that most Taiwanese believe an invasion is unlikely in the next five years.",
      "A survey last year by National Chengchi University in Taipei showed that over 88% of people in Taiwan support maintaining the status quo, in which Taiwan operates as a de facto independent country without formally declaring independence, a move that would risk all-out war with China.",
      "That\u2019s especially true for Taiwan\u2019s youngest voters, said Lev Nachman, a political scientist and assistant professor at National Taiwan University who has studied their views.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s Gen Zers \u201care by no means pro-China relative to other generations, but they don\u2019t have the same attitude towards Taiwan independence\u201d as millennials do, he said.",
      "\u201cInstead, we see younger generations having a much more sort of pro-status-quo approach to politics,\u201d Nachman said.",
      "Young people in Taiwan were too young to be radicalized in political upheavals such as the island\u2019s Sunflower Movement in 2014 and the martial law era, he said.",
      "They don\u2019t want to \u201crock any major boat\u201d with any \u201cradical change\u201d in the Taiwan Strait, Nachman added, though the desire for unification with mainland China is still \u201cincredibly low.\u201d",
      "The Taiwan government poll found that over a third of respondents ages 18 to 29 viewed China as the island\u2019s \u201cprimary threat\u201d despite efforts by Beijing to win them over with preferential policies for studying and working in the mainland, as well as various activities including sponsored trips, internships and cultural events.",
      "Last year, over 4 million people from Taiwan visited mainland China for tourism, study or work, a year-over-year increase of 54.3%, according to official data released by Chinese authorities. According to China\u2019s Taiwan Affairs Office, young people were the \u201cmost active\u201d group.",
      "\u201cYou are also Chinese. You are our family,\u201d Chan said he and other students from Taiwan were told by a tour guide last year on a Beijing-sponsored trip to the Chinese province of Henan.",
      "While some accuse Beijing of using such efforts to strengthen its sovereignty claims, these measures are \u201cquite good\u201d and enable young people in Taiwan to visit and explore different places, said Chen Pin-yin, a student at the National Taiwan University of Arts.",
      "Chen, 21, who is also pro status quo, said not everything is about politics. Young people in Taiwan are mainly concerned about practical issues such as the cost of living and their job prospects, she said.",
      "Chen did a one-month internship last summer for a variety show in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that was partly funded by Chinese organizers.",
      "The experience was \u201ca dream come true\u201d for Chen, who said the Chinese TV industry is \u201chighly developed.\u201d She said she plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree in mainland China next year and that she would also consider working there.",
      "The most important thing \u201cis to avoid wars for now,\u201d Chen said. \u201cI hope the U.S. can play the role of a mediator when tensions are high.\u201d"

      "Austria\u2019s song, \u201cWasted Love\u201d by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country.",
      "JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish.",
      "Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don\u2019t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earlier sent a video message, played during Tuesday\u2019s semifinal, in which she said she \u201cwould love nothing more\u201d than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest \u201clife-changing.\u201d",

      "On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points.

      "The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel\u2019s Yuval Raphael, whose song \u201cNew Day Will Rise\u201d is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage.",
      "Israel\u2019s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel\u2019s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel\u2019s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",

      "A new North Korean warship was damaged in a \u201cserious accident\u201d during a launch ceremony attended by leader Kim Jong Un, state media reported Thursday in a rare admission of failure by the secretive nuclear-armed state.",
      "The 5,000-ton destroyer slid off a flatcar because of \u201cinexperienced command and operational carelessness in the course of the launch,\u201d according to the Korean Central News Agency, crushing parts of the bottom of the ship.",

      "South Korea also said Thursday that North Korea had fired multiple unidentified cruise missiles and that U.S. and South Korean intelligence authorities were analyzing the details.",
      "The ship accident Wednesday at the northeastern port of Chongjin is a blow to Kim, who has stressed the importance of such destroyers for advancing North Korea\u2019s military capabilities.",
      "Kim described the incident as a \u201ccriminal act caused by absolute carelessness\u201d that \u201ccould not be tolerated,\u201d KCNA said.",
      "He censured the officials involved in the accident, which he said \u201cbrought the dignity and self-respect of our state to a collapse,\u201d and said the ship should be restored before next month\u2019s plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers\u2019 Party.",
      "The North Korean report did not say whether there were any casualties.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Lee said the damaged ship was believed to have capabilities similar to those of North Korea\u2019s first destroyer, the Choe Hyon-ho, which was unveiled late last month in what Kim called a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d in modernizing his naval forces. North Korean state media reported that Kim had supervised tests of the destroyer\u2019s supersonic and strategic cruise missiles, anti-aircraft missile, automatic guns and electronic jamming guns.",
      "Kim said that the destroyer would be deployed early next year and that his next goal in naval modernization was to acquire a nuclear-powered submarine.",
      "Experts say that although North Korea\u2019s naval forces still lag behind those of South Korea, which has 12 destroyers, the new destroyer is considered a serious threat. It is believed to have been built with assistance from Russia, where North Korea has been sending troops and weapons to support its war against Ukraine.",
      "The U.S.-based website 38 North said last week that North Korea was preparing to launch the second destroyer and that it was \u201clikely be side-launched from the quay, a method not previously observed in North Korea.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe use of this launch method could be one of necessity, as the quay where the ship is being built does not have an incline,\u201d it said in a report.",
      "Tensions have heightened on the Korean Peninsula in recent years as Kim accelerates weapons testing for his nuclear and missile programs in what he says is a response to intensifying military cooperation between the United States and its allies. North Korea views joint military exercises among the United States, South Korea and others as a rehearsal for invasion, which those nations deny.",
      "While North Korea\u2019s cruise missile launches on Thursday did not violate United Nations Security Council resolutions, which bar the North from testing ballistic missiles, experts say they are equally as deadly."

      "After Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Kneecap\u2019s X account posted a previous interview with O\u2019Hanna in which he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be 80, 90 years of age and my grandkids asking me, 'Why did nobody do anything about the Palestinian genocide?'

      "More than 53,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its bombing campaign and ground invasion after Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack, according to health officials in the enclave. The attack killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, and hundreds more were taken hostage by Hamas militants, according to Israeli tallies.",
      "After a weekslong ceasefire fell apart in March, Israel resumed its bombardment of the enclave, including a series of assaults that killed 300 people in 72 hours this month. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was \"moving toward full control\" of Gaza.",
      "Kneecap has described criticism of its outspoken views about the war in Gaza as a \"coordinated smear campaign\" by those who \"want to silence criticism of a mass slaughter. They weaponize false accusations of antisemitism to distract, confuse, and provide cover for genocide.\u201d",
      "After the group performed at Coachella last month in front of a screen that said, \u201cF--- Israel, Free Palestine,\" the organizers behind Israel's Tribe of Nova music festival, where hundreds of people were killed in the October 2023 attack, said Kneecap's messaging was \"an affront made even more painful in light of the massacre.\"",
      "\"We invite the members of Kneecap to visit the Nova Exhibition in Toronto and experience firsthand the stories of those who were murdered, those who survived, and those are still being held hostage,\" the organizers said. \"Not to shame or silence \u2014 but to connect.

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan \u2014 The head of American chipmaker Nvidia praised President Donald Trump\u2019s move to modify U.S. curbs on the export of artificial intelligence chips to China, saying Wednesday that the Biden-era controls were a \u201cfailure\u201d that had cost his and other U.S. companies billions of dollars in sales.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the United States rolled out a three-tiered system of export curbs on advanced chips aimed at regulating the global diffusion of AI, blocking China entirely. While Biden said the curbs were necessary to slow China\u2019s development of technology that could have military applications, critics said they could undermine U.S. tech leadership.",
      "The Trump administration said last week that it plans to rescind some of those curbs and replace them with its own restrictions.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s billionaire chief executive, Jensen Huang, said his company controls 50% of the market in China today, compared with almost 95% at the start of the Biden administration in 2021.",
      "\u201cAll in all, the export control was a failure,\u201d he told reporters on the sidelines of Computex, a top technology trade show in the Taiwanese capital of Taipei, saying the curbs were based on the \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d assumption that the U.S. is the only source of AI technology.",
      "Huang, 62, said Chinese companies blocked from buying American products had instead turned to local sources such as Chinese tech giant Huawei, and that they had been spurred to make advances with as little outside help as possible.",
      "\u201cThe local companies are very, very talented and very determined,\u201d Huang said, \u201cand the export control gave them the spirit, the energy and the government support to accelerate their development.\u201d",
      "Those companies \u201cwould love for us never to go back to China,\u201d he said, adding that China is home to 50% of the world\u2019s AI researchers and has an AI market he estimated would be worth $50 billion by next year.",
      "Nvidia said last month that it would write off about $5.5 billion in H20 AI chips it had specifically designed for the China market to comply with previous curbs after the Trump administration said those chips would also be restricted.",
      "\u201cI really do hope that the U.S. government recognizes that the ban is not effective and give us a chance to go back and win the market as soon as possible,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Huang, who was with Trump on his Middle East trip last week along with other tech leaders, lauded the president for his \u201cgreat reversal\u201d of Biden\u2019s policy, known as the AI diffusion rule, saying Trump \u201crealizes it\u2019s exactly the wrong goal.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe sees it very clearly that the race is on,\u201d Huang said, \u201cand if the United States wants to stay ahead, we need to maximize, accelerate our diffusion, not limit it, because somebody else is more than happy to provide it.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s state-led investment in chips has probably exceeded $150 billion over the past decade, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit.",
      "Beijing has repeatedly criticized the U.S. over its chip curbs, including guidelines Washington issued last week that said companies anywhere in the world risked violating U.S. export controls if they used advanced Chinese chips such as Huawei\u2019s Ascend without a license.",
      "The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Monday that the U.S. action \u201cseriously undermines\u201d the consensus the U.S. and China reached earlier this month on slashing their tariffs on each other\u2019s goods.",
      "On Wednesday, the ministry further accused the U.S. of \u201cabusing export controls to suppress and contain China.\u201d It pledged to invoke China\u2019s anti-foreign sanctions law against anyone involved in enforcing the U.S. move, slamming it as \u201ca typical example of unilateral bullying and protectionism.\u201d",

      "Prosecutors said they are also investigating three other people, ages 18 to 21, who are already in custody. All the suspects are German citizens.",
      "According to the prosecutors, the group was formed in mid-April 2024 or earlier. They said that its members saw themselves as the last resort to defend the \u201cGerman nation\u201d and aimed to bring about the collapse of Germany\u2019s democratic order, with attacks on homes for asylum-seekers and on facilities associated with the left-wing political spectrum.",
      "Two of the suspects set a fire at a cultural center in Altd\u00f6bern in eastern Germany in October, prosecutors said, adding that several people living in the building at the time escaped injury only by chance.",
      "In January, another two suspects allegedly broke a window at a home for asylum-seekers in Schm\u00f6lln and tried unsuccessfully to start a blaze by setting off fireworks.

      "Also in January, three suspects allegedly planned an arson attack on a home for asylum-seekers in Senftenberg, but it never came about because of the earlier arrests of two of the men.",

      "\u201cThis is an alarm signal and it shows that right-wing extremist terrorism knows no age,\u201d Hubig said in a statement.",
      "In a separate case a week ago, German authorities banned a far-right group called \u201cKingdom of Germany\u201d as a threat to the country\u2019s democratic order and arrested four of its alleged leaders.",
      "In an annual report released Tuesday, the Federal Criminal Police Office said that the number of violent crimes with a right-wing motivation was up 17.2% last year to 1,488. That was part of an overall increase in violent politically motivated offenses to 4,107, an increase of 15.3%."
