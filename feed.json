      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders",
      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders. It seems unfair to add the fate of the summer movie season to his list. But he's not alone \u2014 Marvel Studios is also returning to theaters in a big way with two movies this summer, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d",
      "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the movie business to a halt, and two years after the strikes, the industry has yet to fully recover. Critics may have complained of superhero fatigue, but after several summers of depleted offerings, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a vital part of the mix.",
      "Superheroes alone don't make for a healthy marketplace, however, and this year studios have set a full slate for every kind of moviegoer, with over 40 wide releases spanning genres.",
      "\u201cThis is the summer where all this product that we\u2019ve all been working on for the last few years is finally coming into the marketplace, so I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d says Joseph Kosinski, who directed \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt.",
      "Summer begins early in Hollywood, on the first weekend in May and that kick-off can make or break that pivotal 123 day corridor that has historically accounted for around 40% of the annual box office.",
      "After the strikes upended the 2024 summer calendar, this year Disney is back in that familiar first weekend spot with \u201cThunderbolts.\" Memorial Day weekend could also be a behemoth with the live action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning.\" With a new \u201cJurassic World,\u201d a live action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and the Formula One movie also on the schedule through June and July, the summer season has the potential to be the biggest in the post-COVID era.",
      "There are also family pics (\u201cSmurfs,\u201d \u201cElio\"); action and adventures (\u201cBallerina,\u201d \u201cThe Karate Kid: Legends\u201d); horrors, thrillers and slashers (\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d \u201cM3GAN 2.0\"); romances (\u201cMaterialists,\u201d \u201cJane Austen Wrecked My Life\u201d); dramas (\u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d); a new Wes Anderson movie (\u201cThe Phonecian Scheme\u201d); and comedies (\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d \u201cBride Hard,\u201d \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d).",
      "\u201cDraw me a blueprint of a perfect summer lineup: 2025 is it,\" says Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun twist on what a movie like this could be,\u201d says \u201cThunderbolts\u201d director Jake Schreier.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new,\u201d says \u201cSuperman\u201d director James Gunn. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about the robots and the flying dogs and all that stuff. It\u2019s taking a very real person and putting them in the middle of this outrageous situation and outrageous world and playing with that. I think it\u2019s a lot of fun because of that.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working on an incredibly large scale in terms of world building, but it\u2019s also no different from all of the great comedies and dramas that I\u2019ve done,\u201d says \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d director Matt Shakman. \u201cIn the end, it comes down to character, it comes down to relationships, it comes down to heart and humor.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople say, like, do you feel pressure and the most pressure I feel is from myself as a fan and to Steven Spielberg, to not disappoint him,\" says \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d director Gareth Edwards. \u201cWeirdly what\u2019s great about doing a Jurassic movie is that everybody knows deep down that like half the reason they\u2019re in this business is because of that film and Steven\u2019s work.\u201d",
      "Before the pandemic, all but one summer since 2007 broke the $4 billion mark. Since 2020, only one has: 2023, led by \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The unstable economy might work in the industry\u2019s favor, at least when it comes to moviegoing. Even with increased ticket prices, theatrical movies remain the most affordable entertainment outside of the home and attendance tends to increase during recession years. The annual domestic box office crossed $10 billion for the first time in 2009.",
      "\u201cBy the end of this summer, hopefully people aren\u2019t talking about being in a funk anymore and it feels like we got our mojo back and we\u2019re off to the races,\" Kosinski, who directed the pandemic-era hit \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d says.",

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The main cause of Gene Hackman's death was heart disease, but he was also in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease and likely had not eaten for a long time, according to a new autopsy report.",
      "The report documents the 95-year-old actor\u2019s poor heart health, noting he had experienced congestive heart failure, an aortic valve replacement and an irregular heart beat. He was given a pacemaker in April 2019.",
      "Hackman\u2019s carbon monoxide concentration was less than 5% saturation, which is within the normal range. He tested negative for the hantavirus, which is a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings.",
      "Authorities have said Hackman\u2019s wife, Betsy Arakawa, likely died Feb. 11 at home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Her autopsy report hasn\u2019t yet been released.",
      "A toxicology report says Hackman tested negative for alcohol and intoxicating drugs, but that he had a low concentration of acetone in his system that indicates prolonged fasting.",
      "Hackman appeared to have outlived Arakawa at home by about a week, possibly unaware of his wife's death. Hackman\u2019s pacemaker showed an abnormal heart rhythm on Feb. 18 \u2014 the day he likely died, according to the state's chief medical examiner.",
      "Records released earlier in the investigation showed Arakawa made phone calls and internet searches as she scoured for information on flu-like symptoms and breathing techniques.",
      "Recently released videos outline the scope of the investigation into the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa.",
      "Before they understood how Hackman and Arakawa died, authorities recorded themselves conducting interviews with workers and returning to Hackman\u2019s home to search for more evidence. Detectives searched the home in early March for Arakawa\u2019s laptop and other clues.",

      "The annual AFI Life Achievement Award presentation is always a starry night in Hollywood, but Saturday\u2019s ceremony at the Dolby Theatre brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema to honor Francis Ford Coppola",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Steven Spielberg proclaimed \u201cThe Godfather\u201d the \u201cgreatest American film ever made,\u201d Robert De Niro teasingly bemoaned being cast in the sequel and not the original and Harrison Ford fought back tears reflecting on his role in the 1974 film, \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all was Francis Ford Coppola, who on Saturday received the AFI Life Achievement Award at a ceremony at Dolby Theatre that brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema,",
      "A founding AFI trustee, Coppola\u2019s recognition from the organization was a kind of full circle moment for the \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d director.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid there was the Oscars and that was it. Now they\u2019re going to have an award show for the best award show,\u201d the 86-year-old said on the red carpet ahead of the show. \u201cBut this is a little different because it\u2019s a personal recognition of the people that you\u2019ve known all your life and your colleagues over many years, so it\u2019s like a homecoming in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou, sir, are peerless. You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film,\u201d Spielberg said.",
      "Coppola sat between Spielberg and George Lucas, as actors and fellow filmmakers like Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Morgan Freeman took turns gushing over the Oscar winner.",
      "\u201cDreamer of dreams on a dime, teller of tales that cost and lost millions. But tonight, (expletive) the bankers and the bank,\u201d Freeman said to laughs and cheers.",
      "Lucas, Coppola\u2019s longtime friend and colleague, presented him with the award. The pair have known each other for decades and cofounded their own production company, American Zoetrope, in 1969.",
      "\u201cYou rounded up a bunch of young film students, gathered us together. We moved to San Francisco, hoping to beat the system. And we did. Like the filmmakers from the dawn of the art form, we had no rules. We wrote them, and you were holding the pen,\u201d Lucas said.",
      "Coppola was mostly stoic throughout the ceremony as Hollywood sang his praises \u2014 until he accepted the award at the end of the night. He beamed as he approached the stage and thanked the room, which was filled with some of his family members as well as multigenerational A-listers.",
      "\u201cNow I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn\u2019t really a place at all, but you \u2014 friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,\u201d he said. \u201cI am and will always be nothing more than one of you.\u201d",
      "Coppola was the 50th recipient of the award first handed out to John Ford in 1973.",
      "Guests were served wine from the Francis Ford Coppola Winery and after dinner \u2014 true to his Italian heritage \u2014 a trio of cannolis. Actors who have worked with Coppola painted a unified picture of him as a director, reminiscing on how they were invited to participate and educated about film in a way that empowered them.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very professorial. He talks about history and things and even older movies in the scene he\u2019s inspired by,\u201d said \u201cThe Godfather III\u201d star Andy Garcia. \u201cYou go into working with him in a movie, and you go in seeking an associate\u2019s degree and you would walk out with a master\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Coppola last year released his long-in development \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d a Roman epic set in a modern New York. The film drew mixed reviews from critics and flopped with audiences. Coppola, though, has maintained he was compelled to make \u201cMegalopolis\u201d as an artist, not as a businessman. He self-financed the film.",
      "\u201cFor a year in our culture when the importance of the arts is minimized, and our industry is seemingly out in the open that the only metric to judge a film\u2019s success is by how much money it makes, I hang on to individuals like Francis for inspiration, who live through their convictions,\u201d said Adam Driver, who starred in the film.",
      "Last year\u2019s AFI honoree was Nicole Kidman. Other recent recipients include John Williams, Mel Brooks, Denzel Washington and Julie Andrews.",

      "Likewise, it\u2019s an hour into Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d when a helicopter suddenly deposits three women onto a stage. They're scantily clad Playboy Bunnies, choppered in to rile up the troops. They, too, appear for just a few minutes.",
      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most unforgettable films of the late 1970s and 1980s, as top Hollywood filmmakers like Kubrick, Coppola, Oliver Stone and others grappled with its painful legacy. Few, however, had classic, or even three-dimensional, female characters \u2014 with the notable exception of \u201cComing Home,\u201d which won Jane Fonda an Oscar.",
      "But while these films were almost exclusively about how war dehumanized men \u2014 with female characters mere devices to tell that story \u2014 the opposite was often true of Vietnamese films about the conflict. Many of these were told from a female viewpoint \u2014 the stories of brave and loyal women, for example, left to hold families together.",
      "Here are some ways that classic Vietnam War films used female characters to tell their stories:",
      "Michael Cimino\u2019s multi-Oscar-winning \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d focuses on three lifelong buddies from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to fight, with traumatic results.",
      "Since the 1978 drama starts and ends at home, there\u2019s room for a female character in Meryl Streep\u2019s Linda, girlfriend of Nick (Christopher Walken) who also connects with Michael (Robert De Niro). An early-career Streep was such a magnetic presence as Linda \u2014 earning an Oscar nomination \u2014 that it disguised a fairly thin role that mainly advanced the men's narrative.",
      "A rare contrast was Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d the same year, in which Fonda and Jon Voight both won Oscars for the tale of a Marine wife embroiled in an intense affair with a wounded veteran at the rehab center where she volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is the only Hollywood film set during the Vietnam War that\u2019s told from the point of view of a female character,\u201d says filmmaker Tony Bui, who also teaches Vietnam War cinema at Columbia University. \u201cThat's really saying something.\u201d",
      "Its tortured journey to the screen is a drama in itself, but 1979's \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d with Martin Sheen as an army captain tasked with assassinating a renegade U.S. colonel (Marlon Brando), is considered a masterpiece of the genre. As in many Hollywood Vietnam films, women are extras in villages, screaming and running from gunfire and deadly explosions \u2014 or killed brutally for no reason at all.",
      "Then there are the Playboy Bunnies, who gyrate to \u201cSuzy Q\u201d as the troops become increasingly frenzied with erotic excitement and eventually storm the stage.",
      "Lan Duong, assistant professor of cinema studies at the University of Southern California, sees Coppola trying to make a connection between sex, warfare and masculinity.",
      "\u201cWith American white women in particular, they\u2019re seen as part of the American mythology around manhood,\u201d Duong says. Full-blooded manhood with raging hormones, she says, is \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
      "In 1986's \u201cPlatoon,\u201d Stone's Oscar-winning depiction of jungle warfare, representation of women comes in a horrific scene in which U.S. troops kills hundreds of innocent villagers, evoking the real-life My Lai massacre. During the slaughter, idealistic soldier Chris (Charlie Sheen) comes upon soldiers raping young women. \u201cShe\u2019s a human being!\u201d he screams. They reply: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in \u2019Nam, man.\u201d",
      "These women are given no voice. They appear \u201conly in relation to the violence inflicted by men,\u201d Bui says.",
      "In Brian de Palma\u2019s \u201cCasualties of War\u201d (1989), the tragic rape victim actually becomes a central character in the plot. This does not mean, however, that we learn much of anything about this Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le).",
      "Based on a real event, the film follows five soldiers whose leader (Sean Penn) devises a sickening plan: The group will kidnap a young girl for \u201crecreation\u201d during a mission.",
      "Only Pvt. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) objects. The four others not only rape the girl, but eventually pump her with bullets. Eriksson takes the case to superiors, who advise him to drop it. But Eriksson persists, and the men earn punishment.",
      "Though important, this brutalized girl is again voiceless. \u201cShe goes from suffering, to suffering more, and then gets killed \u2014 that\u2019s her arc,\u201d says Bui, who includes the movie in a Criterion Channel collection he has curated on Vietnam films.",
      "Kubrick\u2019s memorable 1987 \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d contains two brief, stereotypical scenes involving sex workers. But the most interesting scene involving a female character comes during battle, where a sniper targeting U.S. troops turns out to be a terrified girl in pigtails. As she lies mortally wounded, she begs quietly, \u201cShoot me.\u201d The soldiers oblige.",
      "The stereotypical nature of the sex worker scenes is, for Bui, redeemed somewhat by the character of the sniper (Ngoc Le), whose courage is acknowledged.",
      "In Bui's own \u201cThree Seasons,\u201d a 1999 Vietnamese-American production, sex worker Lan (Diep Bui) is central to the story, an exploration of postwar life in Ho Chi Minh City. A cyclo driver falls in love with Lan and trails her around the city, trying to help her find a better life.",
      "Bui says his research has found that more than half of Vietnamese films about the conflict have female protagonists. One of the most famous, H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d (1974), follows a young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searching for her family in bombed-out Hanoi.",
      "Another, \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes\u201d (1984), tells the story of Duyen (L\u00ea V\u00e2n), a young wife and mother in the rural north whose husband goes to war. Her ailing father-in-law asks frequently why the soldier has not written home. Duyen learns one day that her husband's been dead for a year and enlists a local schoolteacher to help her hide that by forging eloquent letters.",
      "The character is emblematic of the way Vietnamese culture has long portrayed the woman: fierce, loyal and resilient in the face of adversity, argues Duong.",
      "\u201cShe is beautiful. She\u2019s suffering. She\u2019s loyal to the memory of her dead husband,\u201d notes Duong. \u201cIt\u2019s been argued by \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh himself ... that she's a symbol for the nation itself. So it becomes a really rich metaphor for filmmakers.\u201d",
      "The risk, she adds, is that such characters, serving as symbols, can also lack dimension.",
      "Stone is one of the only directors to have explicitly addressed the minimal role of women in his Vietnam works, saying \u201cPlatoon\u201d was deliberately a male-driven narrative.",
      "But with his third and last Vietnam War film, \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d (1993), Stone shifted to the perspective of a real-life Vietnamese woman: Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le), who endures rape and torture as a young woman, then moves to California with her troubled American military husband (Tommy Lee Jones).",

      "Wrexham has sealed promotion to the second tier of English soccer by beating Charlton 3-0",
      "WREXHAM, Wales -- Wrexham fans ignored the warnings. They were always going to.",
      "By the time the final whistle blew on Saturday to confirm promotion to English soccer's second tier, thousands were ready and waiting to storm the home field in celebration.",
      "Flares were lit, red smoke filled the air, Welsh flags were waved proudly and songs sung raucously.",
      "Wrexham was one step from the Premier League and nothing was going to stop this party.",
      "Charlton was beaten 3-0 to ensure Wrexham went up as the third division runner-up behind champion Birmingham, and co-owner Ryan Reynolds reflected on their third promotion in three seasons.",
      "\u201cIt just seemed like an impossible dream,\u201d the movie star said. \u201cWe said five years ago our goal was to make it to the Premier League. There were understandably a lot of laughs, but it feels like a thing that could make it to fruition right now.\u201d",
      "There were warnings of police action for pitch invaders before kickoff. And as the game reached its final moments, an announcement over the loudspeaker told fans it could be stopped if they didn't move back behind barricades.",
      "But everyone inside the club's historic Racecourse Ground knew what was coming, and within seconds of the whistle the field was a sea of red as Wrexham supporters celebrated wildly.",
      "The Welsh soccer team's remarkable rise under Hollywood owners Reynolds and Rob McElhenney has hit a new high \u2014 returning to the second tier for the first time since the 1981-82 campaign.",
      "It means that from next season it will be playing one level below the Premier League, something that was unthinkable just four years ago when it was a struggling non-league team.",
      "Reynolds and McElhenney were part of a full house of nearly 13,000 fans.",
      "\u201cThe stadium and atmosphere is incredible, it\u2019s a massive club and a big project, it will be a special week now,\u201d said striker Sam Smith, who scored two goals in the win.",
      "Who knows what's next for a team that has defied the odds since the actors bought it for $2.5 million in 2021 and turned it into a household name around the world.",
      "\u201cThe owners have come in and done an amazing job. I\u2019m so pleased for them because they deserve it,\u201d manager Phil Parkinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re invested in all the decisions, but they trust us in in our decision making and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had success over the last three years.\u201d",
      "While celebrations greeted the final whistle, the party began much earlier after promotion rival Wycombe lost to Leyton Orient 1-0.",
      "Wrexham just needed victory then to clinch the second promotion place in League One.",
      "Reynolds posed for selfies with fans outside and served drinks behind the bar in a marquee set up outside the nearby Turf pub, which has earned world renown from the docuseries \u201cWelcome to Wrexham.\u201d",
      "Fans erupted in cheers after the final whistle of Wycombe\u2019s loss, which was shown on a big screen.",
      "Wrexham just needed to finish the job off against fourth-placed Charlton and eased nerves with two goals in the space of three minutes in the first half. Oliver Rathbone\u2019s long shot in the 15th minute was followed by Smith\u2019s volley.",
      "When Smith headed in a third in the 81st the outcome was in no doubt and Wrexham's fans serenaded the players with chants of \u201cWe are going up.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is for those supporters who followed the team in those 15 years in the (non-league) National League in really, really tough times, but stood strong behind their club and they deserve tonight,\u201d Parkinson said.",

      "Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., amid a shift in priorities and the ousting of leadership at one of the nation\u2019s premier cultural institutions.",
      "Multiple artists and producers involved in the center\u2019s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. And in the wake of the cancellations, Washington\u2019s Capital Pride Alliance has disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,\u201d said June Crenshaw, deputy director of the alliance. \u201cWe are finding another path to the celebration \u2026 but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\u201d",
      "The Kennedy Center\u2019s website still lists Tapestry of Pride on its website with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. There are no other details.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not respond to a request from the AP for comment.",
      "The move comes on the heels of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, with President Donald Trump firing both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who then elected him the new Kennedy Center chairman.",
      "The World Pride event, held every two years, starts in just under a month \u2014 running from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the capital city. But Trump administration policies on transgender rights and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances have sparked concern about what kind of reception attendees will receive.",
      "\u201cI know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,\u201d said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center abruptly canceled within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Roest told the AP he was in the final stages of planning the Kennedy Center performance after months of emails and Zoom calls. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump posted on social media Feb. 7 of the leadership changes and his intention to transform the Kennedy Center\u2019s programming.",
      "Immediately the Kennedy Center became nonresponsive, Roest said. On Feb. 12, he said, he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer stating, \u201cWe are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey went from very eager to host to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that\u2019s not going to stop us.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the cancellation, Roest said he managed to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Crenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be moved to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.",
      "Monica Alford, a veteran event planner with a long history of working with the Kennedy Center, was scheduled to organize an event June 8 as part of Tapestry of Pride, but said she also saw communication abruptly end within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Alford organized the first ever drag brunch on the Kennedy Center rooftop in 2024, and said she regarded the institution \u2014 and its recent expansion known as The Reach \u2014 as \u201cmy home base\u201d and \u201ca safe space for the queer community\u201d",
      "She said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she described as \u201cmeant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.\u201d",
      "She said she mourns the loss of the partnership she nurtured with the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing our community a disservice \u2014 not just the queer community but the entire community,\u201d she said.",
      "Roest said he never received an explanation as to why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center, and he believes most queer artists would make the same choice.",
      "\u201cThere would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it is a hostile performance space.\u201d",

      "A former roommate of one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers has testified the woman told her in July 2006 that the then-movie mogul had forcibly performed oral sex on her",
      "NEW YORK -- Hovering in the doorway of her roommate's bedroom one evening in July 2006, TV production assistant Miriam Haley said Harvey Weinstein \u2014 her boss \u2014 had forcibly performed oral sex on her, her then-roommate testified Thursday at the ex-movie mogul's retrial.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Miriam, that sounds like rape. I think you should call a lawyer,\u2019\u201d but a shaken Haley seemed disinclined to do so, recalled the ex-roommate, Elizabeth Entin.",
      "If secondhand, it was the first testimony jurors have gotten so far about any of the alleged sexual assaults at the heart of the retrial, which opened Wednesday. Haley and two other accusers are expected to testify later in the weekslong proceeding.",
      "Weinstein, 73, maintains that he has never sexually assaulted or raped anyone. His lawyers argue that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer in hopes of getting ahead in the entertainment business.",
      "Weinstein was transformed in 2017 from a Hollywood tycoon into the #MeToo movement's archvillain, after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public.",
      "He was convicted in 2020 of raping Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor, and sexually assaulting Haley, who worked on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway.\u201d But New York's highest court overturned his conviction last year, finding that the trial judge had allowed prejudicial testimony.",
      "The reversal led to the retrial, which includes an additional allegation of forcible oral sex on a different woman, former model Kaja Sokola. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "Entin was among the witnesses who are returning to the stand five years after testifying in the landmark #MeToo case. But prosecutors, some defense lawyers and the judge are different \u2014 and so are the contours of the testimony and evidence being elicited.",
      "For instance, this time Entin didn't give any details of what she said Haley told her about the alleged sexual assault.",
      "And Entin wasn't asked about a recollection that made for a memorable and rare light moment at the first trial \u2014 a time when she said Weinstein showed up uninvited and was chased around the women's apartment by Entin's pet Chihuahua.",
      "Farber had indicated he didn't think that having Entin describe the purported episode was fair game for the trial.",
      "In another measure of the looping trajectory of the case, Entin found herself testifying about what she has said and written about the first trial itself. The fashion startup founder and consultant has reflected on the case in a book, on podcasts and some interviews.",
      "Weinstein attorney Jennifer Bonjean confronted her with instances in which Entin referred to her participation in the first trial as her \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d and compared gearing up for testifying to preparing for battle.",
      "Entin responded tensely that being cross-examined was a form of \u201cvery civilized battle.\u201d",
      "The voluble Entin said that her writing style was sometimes \u201cmildly hyperbolic,\u201d but that she'd been describing how she girded herself for a daunting experience.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to be named. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "The Vietnam War cast a long shadow across one of the most fertile periods of American filmmaking, and has led filmmakers for the half-century since to reckon with its complicated legacy.",
      "These 10 films, assembled to mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, range from indelible anti-war classics to Vietnamese portraits of resistance, capturing the vastness of the war\u2019s still-reverberating traumas.",
      "The war was more than a decade in and some eight years from its conclusion when a 25-year-old Martin Scorsese made this six-minute short. In it, a man simply shaves himself before a sink and a mirror. After a few knicks and cuts, he doesn\u2019t stop, continuing until his face is a bloody mess \u2014 a neat but gruesome metaphor to Vietnam.",
      "A young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searches for her family in the bombed-out ruins of Hanoi in H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark of Vietnamese cinema. It\u2019s a work of wartime propaganda (it begins with the intro: \u201chonoring the heroes of Hanoi who defeated the American imperialist B-52 bombing raid\u201d) but also of aching humanity. Set against the December 1972 bombing raids on Hanoi, \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d is cinema made in the very midst of war.",
      "Controversy greeted Peter Davis\u2019 landmark documentary around its release, but time has only proved how soberly clear-eyed it was. Newsreel clips and homefront interviews are contrasted with the horrors on the ground in Vietnam in this penetrating examination of the gulf between American policy and Vietnamese reality. Its title comes from President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s line, said when escalating the war, that \u201cthe ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there.\u201d",
      "It's arguably the preeminent American film about the Vietnam War. No other movie more grandly or tragically charts the American evolution from innocence to disillusionment than Michael Cimino\u2019s devastating epic about working-class friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage) from a Pennsylvania steel town drafted into war. The final sing-along scene to \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d after their lives have irrevocably changed, remains a powerfully poignant gut punch.",
      "Francis Ford Coppola wagered everything he had on his masterpiece \u2014 and nearly lost it. \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d which transposes Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d to the Vietnam War, is an epic of madness that teeters on the brink of hallucination. Shot in the Philippines and more faithful to Conrad than to Vietnam, \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d doesn\u2019t so much illuminate the chaos and moral confusion of the war as elevate it to grandiose nightmare.",
      "The 1980s saw a wave of Hollywood films about Vietnam, including \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d \u201cHamburger Hill,\u201d \u201cGood Morning Vietnam,\u201d \u201cCasualties of War\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d Foremost among them is the Oscar best picture-winning \u201cPlatoon,\u201d which Oliver Stone wrote based on his own experiences as an infantryman in Vietnam. Widely acclaimed for its realism, Stone\u2019s film remains among the most intensely vivid and visceral dramatizations of the war.",
      "Stanley Kubrick should be more often thought of as the supreme anti-war moviemaker. His devastating World War I film \u201cPaths of Glory\u201d and the subversive satire \u201cDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\u201d are classics in their own right. \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d carries those films\u2019 themes of dehumanization into an even more brutal place. Split between the harrowing boot-camp tyranny of R. Lee Ermey\u2019s drill instructor and the urban violence of the 1968 Tet Offensive, \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d fuses both ends of the war machine.",
      "How former soldiers lived with their experience in Vietnam has been a subject of many fine films, from Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d (1978) to Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d (2020). In Werner Herzog\u2019s nonfiction gem, he profiles the astonishing story of German-American pilot Dieter Dengler. In the film, which Herzog later remade as 2007\u2019s \u201cRescue Dawn\u201d with Christian Bale, Dengler recounts \u2014 and sometimes reenacts \u2014 his experience being shot down over Laos, being captured and tortured and then escaping into the jungle.",
      "Not long after the turn of the century, former U.S. defense secretary and Vietnam War architect Robert S. McNamara sat for interviews with documentarian Errol Morris. The result is a chilling reflection on the thinking that led to one of American\u2019s greatest follies. It\u2019s not a mea culpa but a thornier and more disquieting rumination on how rationalized ideology can lead to the deaths of millions \u2014 and still not yield an apology. Of McNamara\u2019s lessons, No. 1 is \u201cempathize with the enemy.\u201d",

While government analyst Daniel Ellsberg (a moving participant in \u201cHearts and Minds\u201d) could be considered the hero of this story, \u201cThe Post\u201d turns its focus to Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) and the wartime role of the Fourth Estate.",

      "If you wanted to find the Vietnam War in American television shows, you mostly had to wait until it was long over",
      "The evening news brought the Vietnam War into American living rooms, but once the news was over, so was the war. Prime-time shows brought nary a mention of it as networks looked to bring uncontroversial content to the broadest possible audience. But the war simmered below the surface as subtext, and when enough years passed, television would finally take it on as a subject.",
      "\u201cGomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\u201d premiered on CBS six weeks after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorized U.S. combat troops in Vietnam, and the daft comedy was among the chief images of the military in American homes through the peak of U.S. involvement in 1969. Naturally, the show about a country rube in the Marine Corps never directly mentioned the war. But most of the real-life Marines who marched in its introduction would soon be fighting in Vietnam. Star Jim Nabors later said watching that intro was difficult, knowing some of those men had died.",
      "It would take \u201cAll in the Family\u201d to bring the war into prime-time discourse. The Norman Lear-created CBS comedy owed its popularity to timely political bickering between cantankerous patriarch Archie Bunker (Carroll O\u2019Connor) and his liberal-minded son-in-law Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic (Rob Reiner). Vietnam was the sole subject of a landmark 1976 episode where a draft-dodging fugitive friend of Michael\u2019s comes to Christmas dinner, and an explosive argument ensues. \u201cWhen the hell are you going to admit that the war was wrong?!\u201d Michael shouts. A friend of Archie\u2019s whose son died in the war shocks him by taking his son-in-law\u2019s side.",
      "Set in the Korean War of the early 1950s, \u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d the CBS dramedy about wisecracking U.S. Army doctors, was among the most popular shows in the country during the Vietnam War\u2019s final years. It was heavy with anti-military, anti-war sentiment, evoking the zeitgeist of a Vietnam-exhausted populace. \u201cWar isn\u2019t Hell,\u201d Hawkeye Pierce, played by Alan Alda, says in a typical line. \u201cThere are no innocent bystanders in Hell, but war is chock full of them.\u201d (The Robert Altman film the show stemmed from deliberately minimized references to Korea to maximize its unspoken commentary on Vietnam.)",
      "Television's first regular portrayal of Vietnam veterans came in the form of a cartoonish crew of daring mercenaries that reflected the era of Reagan and Rambo. NBC\u2019s \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d whose members included a mohawked-and-gold-chained Mr. T and a cigar-chomping George Peppard, were a \u201ccrack commando unit\u201d who were innocent fugitives from military justice and worked as mercenaries pulling off weekly capers. Explosions and jumping cars abounded. In a fourth-season episode, the team returns to Vietnam for a job. Peppard\u2019s Hannibal momentarily struggles with dark war memories before getting back to the lighthearted action.",
      "HBO aired and helped organize a 1987 charity concert dubbed \u201cWelcome Home\u201d that billed itself as the warm celebration Vietnam War veterans never got upon their return. Performers included James Brown, Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Wonder. The July Fourth concert was not a militaristic affair, and had a hate-the-war, love-the-troops vibe. Some of the most anti-war songs of the \u201960s were performed by artists like John Fogerty and Crosby, Stills & Nash. The event would be a harbinger of a wave of cultural nostalgia and reckoning as baby boomers began turning 40 and were in the mood to reflect.",
      "With \u201cTour of Duty,\u201d the Vietnam War finally came to prime time. The CBS series that premiered in 1987 showed actual combat and the young men who fought and died in it. It might have been called \u201cPlatoon: The Series,\u201d after the Vietnam film that had just won best picture at the Oscars. Surprisingly gory and gritty for a network show, it had all the hallmarks of the era\u2019s many Vietnam movies. But executives seeking lower costs and higher ratings \u2014 which never came \u2014 eventually moved production from Hawaii to California and introduced romances and soapy plotlines typical of TV dramas.",
      "And suddenly, there were two Vietnam series on TV. ABC\u2019s \u201cChina Beach\u201d was part-\u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d part-\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d part-\u201cMad Men.\u201d Set in a wartime evacuation hospital \u2014 the title was the Americans\u2019 nickname for My Khe Beach in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng \u2014 it focused on Army medics and civilians. It was festooned with \u201960s songs whose copyrights have kept the series off streaming services. Beloved by critics, \u201cChina Beach\u201d made a star and a best-actress Emmy winner of Dana Delany, but never found a mass audience. With its cancellation, network TV depictions of the war would disappear for years.",
      "\u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d was baby boomer nostalgia in its purest form. The ABC series, narrated by an adult Kevin Arnold (voiced by Daniel Stern, played as a child by Fred Savage), depicts his boyhood feelings and experiences with the backing of sentimental \u201960s songs. The specter of Vietnam dominates its first season, which sees Kevin\u2019s hero \u2014 the big brother of his neighbor and crush Winnie Cooper \u2014 die in the war. In a 2021 reboot, the story shifts to a Black family in Alabama, with narrator Dean Williams\u2019 brother a returning Vietnam vet who faces racism at home.",
      "The NBC miniseries \u201cThe \u201960s\u201d was a roundup of the decade\u2019s cliches that by then had been well-established in movies and TV. The 1999 two-night event was billed as \u201cthe movie event of a generation.\u201d Its subjects were three Chicago siblings who each go on very 1960s journeys. For Jerry O\u2019Connell\u2019s high-school quarterback character, that meant serving in Vietnam. He enlists in a gung-ho moment, but by the show\u2019s second night, he\u2019s back home with an Army jacket and long hair, drinking to bury his trauma. The show drew a big audience at a time when NBC was ratings king.",
      "The time-hopping, tear-jerking NBC family drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d used the Vietnam War to delve into the psyche of Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia), who refused to talk about his experience as a soldier with his wife and kids before his premature death. In dual plotlines that run through its third season, with the emotional themes and folk-acoustic soundtrack that are hallmarks of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Jack is shown enlisting to try to protect his drafted younger brother. Decades later, his son Kevin (Justin Hartley) travels to Vietnam to find out what happened to his father and uncle.",
      "In a docuseries that ran over 10 nights on PBS, the Vietnam War got the same hallowed treatment Ken Burns brought nearly 30 years earlier to the Civil War. Burns and Lynn Novick's \u201cThe Vietnam War\" was not as soft or sentimental as his reputation might have suggested. It was a rare PBS show with a TV-MA rating, and its tone, with a modern soundtrack from composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, matched the messiness of the conflict. The show went to lengths to include a North Vietnamese perspective along with American and South Vietnamese vets and historians.",
      "It took until 2024 before a fictional television show would attempt a Vietnamese perspective of the war\u2019s end and its aftermath, though it brought mixed reactions from Vietnamese American viewers. HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d was based on Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The first two episodes of the black-comic limited series depict a harrowing flight during the fall of Saigon. Actors of Vietnamese descent played most of its main roles, including lead Hoa Xuande. But much of the attention given to it \u2014 and its only Emmy nomination \u2014 went to Robert Downey Jr. for his portrayal of four different white American men.",

      "Harvey Weinstein is on trial again after an appeals court threw out the ex-studio-boss' 2020 rape conviction in a case that was a watershed for the #MeToo movement",
      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements began Wednesday in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s rape retrial, five years after his original #MeToo trial delivered a searing reckoning for one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful figures.",
      "Emphasizing the former studio boss's onetime influence in the movie industry, prosecutor Shannon Lucey said Weinstein used \u201cdream opportunities as weapons\u201d to prey on the three accusers in the case. He is charged with raping one and forcing oral sex on the other two.",
      "\u201cThe defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\u201d Lucey said.",
      "The case is being retried because an appeals court threw out the landmark 2020 conviction.",
      "The retrial is happening at the same Manhattan courthouse as the first trial, and two accusers who testified then are expected to return.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first, which happened during the height of the #MeToo movement. Along with the charges being retried, he faces an additional allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t involved in the first case.",
      "The jury counts seven women and five men \u2014 unlike the seven-man, five-woman panel that convicted him in 2020 \u2014 and there's a different judge.",
      "The #MeToo movement, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has also evolved and ebbed.",
      "At the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, chants of \u201crapist\u201d could be heard from protesters outside.",
      "TV trucks lined the street, and reporters queued for hours to get a seat in the packed courtroom. His lawyers decried the \u201ccarnival-like atmosphere\u201d and fought unsuccessfully to get the trial moved from Manhattan.",
      "This time, over five days of jury selection, there was none of that.",
      "Those realities, coupled with the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling last year vacating his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence \u2014 because the judge allowed testimony about allegations Weinstein was not charged with \u2014 are shaping everything from retrial legal strategy to the atmosphere in court.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant, Miriam Haley, in 2006 and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor, Jessica Mann, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Weinstein also faces a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006. Prosecutors said that the woman, who hasn\u2019t been named publicly, came forward days before his first trial but wasn\u2019t part of that case. They said they revisited her allegations when his conviction was thrown out.",
      "The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. His acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial \u2014 predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Lindsay Goldbrum, a lawyer for the unnamed accuser, said Weinstein\u2019s retrial marks a \u201cpivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases\u201d and a \u201csignal to other survivors that the system is catching up \u2014 and that it\u2019s worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.\u201d",
      "This time around, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is prosecuting Weinstein through its Special Victims Division, which specializes in such cases, after homicide veterans helmed the 2020 version. At the same time, Weinstein has added several lawyers to his defense team \u2014 including Jennifer Bonjean, who is involved in appealing his 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles. She helped Bill Cosby get his conviction overturned and defended R. Kelly in his sex crimes case.",
      "\u201cThis trial is not going to be all about #MeToo. It\u2019s going to be about the facts of what took place,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, said recently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a big deal. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d",
      "But there has already been some talk of #MeToo. A prosecutor asked prospective jurors whether they'd heard of the movement. Most said they had, but that it wouldn't affect them either way.",
      "Others went further.",
      "A woman opined that \u201cnot enough has been done\u201d as a result of #MeToo. A man explained that he had negative feelings about it because his high school classmates had been falsely accused of sexual assault.",
      "Another man said he viewed #MeToo like other social movements: \u201cIt\u2019s a pendulum. It swings way one way, then way the other way, and then it settles.\u201d",
      "None of them is on the jury.",

      "A woman pleaded not guilty Monday to fatally stabbing a Kansas City, Missouri, paramedic as she was being taken to a hospital in an ambulance.",
      "Shanetta Bossell, 39, was arrested Sunday after trying to drive off in the ambulance as others were tending to paramedic Graham Hoffman's chest wound, according to court records. She has been jailed on $1 million bond on charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, assault and resisting arrest. No attorney is listed for her in online court records.",
      "The 29-year-old paramedic had worked for the Kansas City Fire Department for three years and was remembered for his commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cOur community grieves his loss at such a young age with his entire life ahead of him,\u201d Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference Sunday night.",
      "Police spotted Bossell walking along the shoulder of a highway early Sunday, her finger cut and bleeding, according to the probable cause affidavit. She had been freed on bond just two days earlier in a resisting arrest case that Thompson said involved an assault on a law enforcement officer.",
      "While en route to the hospital, the driver heard Hoffman frantically call for help, saying Bossell had a knife. The driver stopped and then rushed to the back. As he flung open the door, he heard Hoffman say, \"She stabbed me in the heart,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "An officer who was following the ambulance then witnessed Bossell get into the vehicle's cab and attempt to put it into drive, according to the affidavit. The officer ultimately was able to wrestle her to the ground. But during the fray, she bit his arm, and he hit her in the head with his firearm to get her to let go, the affidavit said.",
      "A second ambulance arrived and the crew rushed Hoffman to the hospital, where he died later that afternoon.",
      "Thompson said any conviction on the murder charge could draw a life sentence without possibility of parole \u2014 or even a death sentence. But he did not elaborate on prosecution plans and said police continue to investigate what he described as a \u201chorrific\u201d crime.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be perfectly clear,\" he said. \"Our office will use all legal, moral, and ethical tools at our disposal to ensure justice for Graham, his family and the entire community.\u201d",

      "DA NANG, Vietnam -- The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, when the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon fell to Communist forces. But millions of people still face daily battles with its chemical legacy.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Hai, 34, is one of millions with disabilities linked to Agent Orange. Born with severe developmental challenges, it's a struggle for him to complete tasks others take for granted: buttoning the blue shirt he wears to a special school in Da Nang, practicing the alphabet, drawing shapes or forming simple sentences.",
      "Hai grew up in Da Nang, the site of a U.S. air base where departing troops left behind huge amounts of Agent Orange that have lingered for decades, leeching into food and water supplies in areas like Hai's village and affecting generations of residents.",
      "Across Vietnam, U.S. forces sprayed sprayed 72 million liters (19 million gallons) of defoliants during the war to strip the enemy's cover. More than half was Agent Orange, a blend of herbicides.",
      "Agent Orange was laced with dioxin, a type of chemical linked to cancer, birth defects and lasting environmental damage. Today, 3 million people, including many children, still suffer serious health issues associated with exposure to it.",
      "Vietnam has spent decades cleaning up the toxic legacy of the war, in part funded by belated U.S. assistance, but the work is far from complete. Now, millions in Vietnam are worried that the U.S. may abandon Agent Orange cleanup as President Donald Trump slashes foreign aid.",
      "When the war ended, the U.S. turned its back on Vietnam, eager to turn the page on a painful chapter in its history.",
      "But Vietnam was left with dozens of dioxin hotspots spread across 58 of its 63 provinces.",
      "Vietnam says the health impacts last generations, threatening the children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of people exposed to the chemicals with health complications ranging from cancer to birth defects that affects the spine and nervous system.",
      "But the science about the human health impact \u2014 both to those exposed to Agent Orange and the generations that follow \u2014 remains unsettled. This is partly because when the two countries finally started working together in 2006, they focused on finding dioxin in the environment and clearing it instead of studying the still-contentious topic of its impact on human health, said Charles Bailey, co-author of the book \u201cFrom Enemies to Partners: Vietnam, the U.S. and Agent Orange.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe science of causality is still incomplete,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "Vietnam identifies Agent Orange victims by checking family history, where they lived, and a list of health problems linked to the poison. And Hai's disabilities were very likely linked to the spraying of the defoliant, added Bailey.",
      "The 34-year-old dreams of becoming a soldier like his grandfather, was unable to leave home for years, waiting alone while his family went out to work. It was only five years ago that he began attending a special school. \u201cI am happy here because I have many friends,\u201d he said. Other students at the school hope to become tailors or makers of incense sticks.",
      "The contamination also denuded Vietnam\u2019s natural defenses. Nearly half of its mangrove trees, which shield shores from strong storms, were destroyed. Much of its tropical forest was irrevocably damaged, while the herbicide also leached the soil of nutrients in some of Vietnam\u2019s most climate-vulnerable areas.",
      "In the decades after the war ended, the recovering country fenced off heavily contaminated sites like Da Nang airport and began providing support to impacted families.",
      "But the U.S. largely ignored growing evidence of health impacts \u2014 including on its own veterans \u2014 until the mid-2000s, when it and began funding cleanup in Vietnam. In 1991, the U.S. recognized that certain diseases could be related to exposure to Agent Orange and made veterans who had them eligible for benefits.",
      "Since 1991, it has spent over $155 million to aid people with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange or littered by unexploded bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The two countries have also cooperated to recover war dead, with the U.S. aiding Vietnam\u2019s search for its own missing.",
      "Cleaning up Agent Orange is expensive and often dangerous. Heavily polluted soil needs to be unearthed and heated in large ovens to very high temperatures, while less contaminated soil can be buried in secure landfills.",
      "Despite years of work, large sites still need to cleared. In Da Nang, where an air base was contaminated during storage and transportation of Agent Orange, the U.S. completed a $110 million cleanup in 2018 but an area the size of 10 soccer fields still remains heavily contaminated.",
      "Cooperation on war legacy issues also laid a foundation for growing U.S.-Vietnam ties, culminating in 2023 when Vietnam elevated the U.S. to its highest diplomatic status of comprehensive strategic partner.",
      "\u201cThe United States considers Vietnam a key partner in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in Vietnam in 2023.",
      "But Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to USAID stalled key projects in Vietnam, and while many have resumed, doubts remain about U.S. reliability.",
      "Vietnam now has to negotiate a new reality where the U.S. president says the country can no longer afford to help other countries.",
      "The country can\u2019t handle the toxic chemicals that still persist without help, said Nguyen Van An, the chairman of Association for Victims of Agent Orange in Danang. \u201cWe always believe that the U.S. government and the manufacturers of this toxic chemical must have the responsibility to support the victims,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he hoped that any stoppages to ongoing projects due to shifting politics in Washington would be temporary.",
      "Insufficient data means that experts can't definitely say when the risk to human health will end. But the more urgent problem is if that cleanup efforts are interrupted, the now-exposed contaminated soil could get into waterways and harm more people.",
      "A 10-year project to clear the some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil \u2014 enough to fill 40,000 trucks \u2014 at Bien Hoa airbase was launched in 2020. It stopped for a week in March and then restarted.",
      "But Bailey, who worked on issues related to the Agent Orange in Vietnam for years, said future USAID funding for the cleanup and a $30 million program for people with disabilities was uncertain.",
      "With federal cuts to USAID, most staffers in Vietnam are expected to be gone by later this year, leaving nobody to administer funding for remediation programs, even if it is not cut itself.",
      "\u201cThis basically leaves a very large mountain of contaminated soil. Only 30% of which has been dealt with and that is less contaminated,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "He added that less than half of the soil at Bien Hoa had been treated and much of the remaining soil was heavily contaminated and needed to be treated in an as-yet unbuilt incinerator.",
      "Tim Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2019s foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects and is now a senior advisor to Sen. Peter Welch, said Congress still supports the programs but it would be hard for them to continue without staff.",
      "\"For more than 30 years, the U.S. and Vietnam have worked together to rebuild relations by dealing with the worst legacies of the war, like Agent Orange,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the Trump administration is mindlessly shutting everything down, with no concern for the impact of their actions on relations with an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",
      "The U.S. embassy in Hanoi didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Chuck Searcy, an American Vietnam War veteran who has worked on humanitarian programs in the country since 1995, said he worries that trust built over years could erode very rapidly. He pointed out that those who benefit from U.S. funded projects to address war legacies are \u201cinnocent victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been victimized twice, once by the war and the consequences that they\u2019ve suffered. And now by having the rug pulled out from under them,\u201d he said.",

      "The Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by strict drinking water standards for forever chemicals set last year",
      "In pain so bad he couldn\u2019t stand, Chris Meek was rushed to the hospital with a life-threatening ruptured gallbladder. When he emerged from surgery, he learned he had kidney cancer that thankfully hadn\u2019t yet spread.",
      "Meek, a social studies teacher in Wilmington, North Carolina, was 47 at the time. But he remained confused for years about why, as someone seemingly not at risk, he had gotten cancer until Emily Donovan, a parent of students at his school, gave a guest talk about high levels of harmful forever chemicals known as PFAS in North Carolina's environment. When Donovan mentioned kidney cancer, the possible cause of Meek's diagnosis finally clicked.",
      "Until then, Meek said, he \u201chad no idea what PFAS was.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.",
      "In a decision with consequences for tens of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by those strict standards and defend the limits against a water utility industry challenge in federal court.",
      "In North Carolina, runoff from a Chemours plant contaminated the Cape Fear River, creating a crisis for cities like Wilmington that use it for drinking water. Amid public outcry, Wilmington effectively eliminated it from tap water.",
      "Other U.S. communities \u2014 often near military bases or industrial sites \u2014 did the same when test results were frightening and public pressure, local leadership or state law forced PFAS-laden wells offline or prompted installation of expensive filtering systems, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "The EPA said the PFAS found in North Carolina, often called GenX chemicals, can be toxic to the kidney. While other types of PFAS may raise kidney cancer risk, little research has focused on the link between kidney cancer and GenX, according to Sue Fenton, director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University. Chemours said evidence doesn't support arguments that GenX at low levels is a health threat. The company has sharply reduced PFAS discharges.",
      "So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the recently set EPA limits, but most aren't above by much. Forcing this group to reduce PFAS more than doubles the rule\u2019s health benefits but roughly triples its costs, the EPA has said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule set standards for two common types of PFAS at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. Standards for several other PFAS chemicals were set, too, and utilities must meet those levels by 2029.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -\u2013 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has championed fossil fuels and the rollback of major clean air and water rules. His history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals in drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that touches people in a very tangible way across the political spectrum, including in Lee Zeldin\u2019s former district,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Zeldin has offered clues about what the EPA could do. The agency estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion annually and Zeldin said recently that communities struggling to afford a fix for PFAS that are just above the standard might be handled differently than wealthy places with lots of it.",
      "\u201cWhat we are going to have to be is extremely thoughtful in figuring this out,\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, the EPA said it will establish an agency lead for PFAS, develop wastewater limits for PFAS manufacturers and investigate sources that pose an immediate danger to drinking water, among other actions.",
      "Soon, the EPA must tell a federal appeals court in Washington whether the rule should stand or be rewritten, although weakening it could be complicated because the Safe Drinking Water Act prevents new rules from being looser than previous ones. The agency could, however, encourage exemptions and deadline extensions, according to Erik Olson, an attorney with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council supporting the current standards in the court case.",
      "Consider Avondale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, which produces PFAS results modestly above the limits. Officials have done detailed testing and are planning to enhance water treatment. All told, lowering PFAS may cost Avondale more than $120 million, according to Kirk Beaty, the city\u2019s public utility director.",
      "That\u2019s money a city like Avondale \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have sitting in a back room somewhere,\" Beaty said, adding he\u2019ll defer to federal experts to dictate what\u2019s acceptable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we\u2019re a little further ahead of everybody else. If the regulation changes, well you know, we may let off the gas a little bit, we may not,\u201d he said, adding that it is hard to justify spending extra money to do more than what\u2019s required when the cost falls on residents.",
      "If the government decides higher amounts of PFAS are acceptable, that could confuse people, especially in areas where the public is already concerned.",
      "\u201cIf we enter into a gray area over what\u2019s healthy and what\u2019s not healthy, then utilities are at risk of being caught up in a debate for which they have no real responsibility nor expertise to decide on,\u201d said Karine Roug\u00e9, CEO for municipal water at Veolia North America, a water operations company.",
      "The American Water Works Association, an industry group, filed the court challenge to the new rule. It agrees that certain PFAS should be regulated but argues the EPA\u2019s standards go too far, underestimate costs and are \u201cneither feasible nor cost-effective.\u201d There are serious consequences for residents' water bills, it says.",
      "The burden of complying will fall heavily on small utilities that can least afford it. Many water providers already struggle to maintain their existing infrastructure, some experts say. On top of everything else, they face new requirements to replace lead pipes. The AWWA wants the EPA to extend the PFAS and lead deadlines by two years.",
      "There is money available to help. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that help as well.",
      "Meek, who successfully recovered after surgery from cancer and is now 59, is planning to sue over his illness. He once didn\u2019t second-guess using tap water. Now he reaches for bottled water.",

      "Colombia's capital has South America\u2019s only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses and now a topic of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which has been taking place since Sunday in Bogota",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The left arm of Christian Camilo Amaya is tattooed with a skull pierced by a syringe, which he says represents the use of cocaine and heroin. He frequently shot up on streets of Bogota, but he has recently switched to South America's only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses.",
      "Non-profit organization Accion Tecnica Social runs the supervised room named Cambie (or Change in English) in Colombia's capital. Since it opened in June 2023, 14 users had their overdoses treated with injections of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses. The last such case was a year ago.",
      "Amaya often carries a black plastic bag with more than a dozen used syringes, which he puts in a red container for biological waste, as protocols for using the room dictate. He denies being addicted to heroin, but argues the supervised room gives him syringes and training on hygienic injections and overdose prevention.",
      "\u201cI know what substances do to me, so I know I shouldn\u2019t be a frequent user for that very reason, to avoid becoming addicted,\u201d Amaya told The Associated Press in the unmarked drug use room in one of the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods.",
      "The initiative is one of the topics of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which started Sunday in Bogota. It is the first time the conference has been held in Latin America in the past three decades, as the leftist administration of President Gustavo Petro pushes for a revision in the international drug control system of the United Nations.",
      "The supervised consumption room currently has 87 registered users, 26% of whom are Venezuelan migrants, who come to inject themselves or receive syringes, food, guidance on lower-risk injection techniques, or overdose management.",
      "Of the users who come to the room, 91% use heroin, 7% inject cocaine, and less than 2% use speedballs, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. Official data on heroin use in Colombia is scarce.",
      "The project was born in 2022 when organizers started contacting users directly to identify their needs. It received technical advice from other countries, especially Mexico.",
      "For David Moreno, who works at Cambie, the most difficult part of reversing an overdose is not injecting the naloxone but avoiding a follow-up overdose.",
      "\u201cOnce I had a user who would get very violent when she came back from an overdose. She would start hurting herself, then she would take off my jacket and tie it, and I\u2019d have to restrain her,\u201d said Moreno.",
      "\u201cWhen it happens, I am calm. But when the user leaves... Wow, my adrenaline rushes.\u201d",
      "Sam Rivera, the executive-director of OnPoint, a nonprofit organization in New York City that operates supervised injection centers, toured the small, nearly 65-foot room with three patient cubicles before AP's visit.",
      "\u201cI look at it as a mini version of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Rivera said. He argues the initiative is also good for public security.",
      "\u201cI always tell people to come visit an overdose prevention center. When you hear about it, it sounds dangerous or it sounds bad because it sounds like you\u2019re enabling people to use,\" he added. \u201cThese are people who are going to use. So instead of using outside, in danger, leaving these supplies in the street, everything happens inside, everything stays inside.\u201d",

      "U.S. health officials are pushing to get artificial colors out of the nation's food supply",
      "ST. LOUIS -- As pressure grows to get artificial colors out of the U.S. food supply, the shift may well start at Abby Tampow\u2019s laboratory desk.",
      "On an April afternoon, the scientist hovered over tiny dishes of red dye, each a slightly different ruby hue. Her task? To match the synthetic shade used for years in a commercial bottled raspberry vinaigrette \u2014 but by using only natural ingredients.",
      "\u201cWith this red, it needs a little more orange,\u201d Tampow said, mixing a slurry of purplish black carrot juice with a bit of beta-carotene, an orange-red color made from algae.",
      "Tampow is part of the team at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest dyemakers, that is rushing to help the salad dressing manufacturer \u2014 along with thousands of other American businesses \u2014 meet demands to overhaul colors used to brighten products from cereals to sports drinks.",
      "\u201cMost of our customers have decided that this is finally the time when they\u2019re going to make that switch to a natural color,\u201d said Dave Gebhardt, Sensient\u2019s senior technical director. He joined a recent tour of the Sensient Colors factory in a north St. Louis neighborhood.",
      "Last week, U.S. health officials announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate petroleum-based artificial dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called them \u201cpoisonous compounds\u201d that endanger children\u2019s health and development, citing limited evidence of potential health risks.",
      "The federal push follows a flurry of state laws and a January decision to ban the artificial dye known as Red 3 \u2014 found in cakes, candies and some medications \u2014 because of cancer risks in lab animals. Social media influencers and ordinary consumers have ramped up calls for artificial colors to be removed from foods.",
      "The FDA allows about three dozen color additives, including eight remaining synthetic dyes. But making the change from the petroleum-based dyes to colors derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers and even insects won\u2019t be easy, fast or cheap, said Monica Giusti, an Ohio State University food color expert.",
      "\u201cStudy after study has shown that if all companies were to remove synthetic colors from their formulations, the supply of the natural alternatives would not be enough,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cWe are not really ready.\u201d",
      "It can take six months to a year to convert a single product from a synthetic dye to a natural one. And it could require three to four years to build up the supply of botanical products necessary for an industrywide shift, Sensient officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,\u201d said Paul Manning, the company's chief executive. \u201cTens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.\u201d",
      "To make natural dyes, Sensient works with farmers and producers around the world to harvest the raw materials, which typically arrive at the plant as bulk concentrates. They\u2019re processed and blended into liquids, granules or powders and then sent to food companies to be added to final products.",
      "Natural dyes are harder to make and use than artificial colors. They are less consistent in color, less stable and subject to changes related to acidity, heat and light, Manning said. Blue is especially difficult. There aren't many natural sources of the color and those that exist can be hard to maintain during processing.",
      "Also, a natural color costs about 10 times more to make than the synthetic version, Manning estimated.",
      "\u201cHow do you get that same vividness, that same performance, that same level of safety in that product as you would in a synthetic product?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity associated with that.\u201d",
      "Companies have long used the Red 3 synthetic dye to create what Sensient officials describe as \u201cthe Barbie pink.\u201d",
      "To create that color with a natural source might require the use of cochineal, an insect about the size of a peppercorn.",
      "The female insects release a vibrant red pigment, carminic acid, in their bodies and eggs. The bugs live only on prickly pear cactuses in Peru and elsewhere. About 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce 1 kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of dye.",
      "\u201cIt's interesting how the most exotic colors are found in the most exotic places,\u201d said Norb Norbrega, who travels the world scouting new hues for Sensient.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. About 1 in 5 food products in the U.S. contains added colors, whether natural or synthetic, Manning estimated. Many contain multiple colors.",
      "FDA requires a sample of each batch of synthetic colors to be submitted for testing and certification. Color additives derived from plant, animal or mineral sources are exempt, but have been evaluated by the agency.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that the approved dyes are safe when used according to regulations and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "But critics note that added colors are a key component of ultraprocessed foods, which account for more than 70% of the U.S. diet and have been associated with a host of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity.",
      "\u201cI am all for getting artificial food dyes out of the food supply,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. \u201cThey are strictly cosmetic, have no health or safety purpose, are markers of ultraprocessed foods and may be harmful to some children.\u201d",
      "Color is powerful driver of consumer behavior and changes can backfire, Giusti noted. In 2016, food giant General Mills removed artificial dyes from Trix cereal after requests from consumers, switching to natural sources including turmeric, strawberries and radishes.",
      "But the cereal lost its neon colors, resulting in more muted hues \u2014 and a consumer backlash. Trix fans said they missed the bright colors and familiar taste of the cereal. In 2017, the company switched back.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s a product you already love, that you\u2019re used to consuming, and it changes slightly, then it may not really be the same experience,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cAnnouncing a regulatory change is one step, but then the implementation is another thing.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the health secretary, said U.S. officials have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with food companies to phase out artificial colors. Industry officials told The Associated Press that there is no formal agreement.",
      "However, several companies have said they plan to accelerate a shift to natural colors in some of their products.",
      "PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said most of its products are already free of artificial colors, and that its Lays and Tostitos brands will phase them out by the end of this year. He said the company plans to phase out artificial colors \u2014 or at least offer consumers a natural alternative \u2014 over the next few years.",
      "Representatives for General Mills said they\u2019re \u201ccommitted to continuing the conversation\u201d with the administration. WK Kellogg officials said they are reformulating cereals used in the nation\u2019s school lunch programs to eliminate the artificial dyes and will halt any new products containing them starting next January.",
      "Sensient officials wouldn\u2019t confirm which companies are seeking help making the switch, but they said they\u2019re ready for the surge.",
      "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s the timeline,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt certainly requires action.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Novavax's closely watched COVID-19 vaccine is on track for full approval after additional discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, the company said Wednesday.",
      "The news sent company shares soaring more than 21% in morning trading and appeared to resolve concerns that Trump administration officials might be holding up a decision on the shot.",
      "Novavax makes the nation\u2019s only traditional protein-based COVID-19 vaccine. It is still being sold under emergency use authorization \u2014 unlike mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna that have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.",
      "The FDA recently asked Novavax to develop a plan for collecting additional clinical data from those who have gotten the shot, the company said in a statement. It said it is \u201cengaging with the FDA expeditiously\u201d in hopes of receiving approval \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d",
      "At FDA, full vaccine approval is the gold standard. The agency was on track to sign off on Novavax\u2019s license by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters.",
      "But FDA\u2019s acting commissioner, Dr. Sara Brenner, directed the agency\u2019s lead official overseeing the vaccine to pause the decision, according to one of the people. The delay, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, sparked concerns of political interference under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who spent decades leading antivaccine groups before joining the federal government as health secretary.",
      "Last month, FDA\u2019s longtime vaccine chief, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced out over disagreements with Kennedy about vaccine safety.",
      "With full FDA approval, Novavax would have permission to keep its shot on the market indefinitely. Products that receive emergency authorization can be removed by FDA after there is no longer a health emergency.",
      "All the COVID-19 vaccines used in the U.S. train the body to fight the coronavirus by recognizing its outer coating, the spike protein.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna options deliver genetic instructions for the body to temporarily make copies of the protein. In contrast, the Novavax vaccine uses lab-grown copies of the spike protein packaged into nanoparticles and combined with an immune-revving ingredient. Protein-based vaccines have been used for years to prevent other diseases including hepatitis B and shingles.",
      "Each year, the three manufacturers update their vaccine recipes to better match the latest COVID-19 variants that are circulating, just like flu shots are updated yearly.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Reeling from drug overdose deaths and scenes of people smoking fentanyl on sidewalks, San Francisco moved closer Thursday to adopting a \u201crecovery first\u201d drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal, a proposal that has prompted heated debate in the city that pioneered harm reduction.",
      "Opponents of Supervisor Matt Dorsey's proposal say its emphasis on stopping drug use alienates those who are not ready to quit, while proponents say the city has been far too permissive and making drug use safer does not help break the cycle of addiction.",
      "Dorsey, himself recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, amended the proposal in his public safety committee to clarify that distributing safer-use paraphernalia and linking people to social services regardless of whether they are using remain critical to the city's response.",
      "But more than an hour of public comment with cheers and boos from both sides underscored just how touchy the issue remains.",
      "\u201cNo one dies from harm reduction,\u201d Patt Denning said. \u201cPeople die from conventional abstinence-based treatments because they\u2019re either left out or kicked out if they don\u2019t comply with abstinence.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep enabling drugs over and over again,\u201d he said.",
      "In recent years San Francisco's public health department advised people who use drugs to do so with friends to try to prevent overdose deaths. Critics said that sent the wrong message.",
      "Mayor Daniel Lurie, who took office in January, has vowed to solve the city's fentanyl crisis. Last year more than 600 people died from accidental overdoses.",
      "He ordered city-funded nonprofits to offer treatment or counseling options before giving out certain paraphernalia such as foil and pipes, and they will no longer be allowed to distribute those items in parks and on sidewalks.",

      "It also defines recovery as \u201cthe process by which an individual suffering from substance use disorder strives to make positive changes that become part of a voluntarily adopted healthy lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Dorsey said aspiring to live a healthy life free from illicit drug use should not be a controversial goal, and abstention can mean receiving methadone as part of a medication assisted treatment program. San Francisco offers an array of services to help people addicted to drugs, but many residents only see the free foil and pipes, he said.",
      "\u201cWe're losing the battle on harm reduction when people think that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said after the hearing.",
      "The San Francisco Marin Medical Society, which represents more than 3,500 physicians, proposed the amendments.",

      "Attiya said he needs at least three dialysis sessions every week, at least four hours each time. Now, his two sessions last two or three hours at most.",
      "Israel\u2019s blockade, and its numerous evacuation orders across much of the territory, have challenged his ability to reach regular care.",
      "He has been displaced at least six times since fleeing his home near the northern town of Beit Hanoun in the first weeks of the war. He first stayed in Rafah in the south, then the central city of Deir al-Balah. When the latest ceasefire took effect in January, he moved again to another school in western Gaza City.",
      "Until recently, Attiya walked to the hospital for dialysis. But he says the limited treatment, and soaring prices for the mineral water he should be drinking, have left him in a wheelchair.",
      "His family wheels him through a Gaza that many find difficult to recognize. Much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThere is no transportation. Streets are damaged,\u201d Attiya said. \u201cLife is difficult and expensive.\u201d",
      "He said he now has hallucinations because of the high levels of toxins in his blood.",
      "\u201cThe occupation does not care about the suffering or the sick,\u201d he said, referring to Israel and its soldiers.",
      "Six of the seven dialysis centers in Gaza have been destroyed during the war, the World Health Organization said earlier this year, citing the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. The territory had 182 dialysis machines before the war and now has 102. Twenty-seven of them are in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people rushed home during the two-month ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThese equipment shortages are exacerbated by zero stock levels of kidney medications,\u201d the WHO said.",
      "Israel has raided hospitals on several occasions during the war, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and say the raids have gutted the territory's health care system as it struggles to cope with mass casualties from the war.",
      "The Health Ministry says over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's offensive, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "At Shifa Hospital, the head of the nephrology and dialysis department, Dr. Ghazi al-Yazigi, said at least 417 patients with kidney failure have died in Gaza during the war because of lack of proper treatment.",
      "That\u2019s from among the 1,100 patients when the war began.",
      "Like Attiya, hundreds of dialysis patients across Gaza are now forced to settle for fewer and shorter sessions each week.",
      "\u201cThis leads to complications such as increased levels of toxins and fluid accumulation \u2026 which could lead to death,\u201d al-Yazigi said.",
      "Mohamed Kamel of Gaza City is a new dialysis patient at the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney failure during the war and beginning treatment this year.",
      "These days, \u201cI feel no improvement after each session,\u201d he said during one of his weekly visits.",
      "The father of six children said he no longer has access to filtered water to drink, and even basic running water is scarce. Israel last month cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory.",
      "Kamel said he has missed many dialysis sessions. Last year, while sheltering in central Gaza, he missed one because of an Israeli bombing in the area. His condition deteriorated, and the next day he was taken by ambulance to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.",
      "\u201cThe displacement has had consequences,\u201d Kamel said. \u201cI am tired.\u201d",

      "The Agriculture Department says it is withdrawing a plan to limit salmonella bacteria in poultry products",
      "The Agriculture Department will not require poultry companies to limit salmonella bacteria in their products, halting a Biden Administration effort to prevent food poisoning from contaminated meat.",
      "The department on Thursday said it was withdrawing a rule proposed in August after three years of development. Officials with the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service cited feedback from more than 7,000 public comments and said they would \u201cevaluate whether it should update\u201d current salmonella regulations.",
      "The rule would have required poultry companies to keep levels of salmonella bacteria under a certain threshold and test for the presence of six strains most associated with illness, including three found in turkey and three in chicken. If the levels exceeded the standard or any of those strains were found, the poultry couldn\u2019t be sold and would be subject to recall, the proposal had said.",
      "The plan aimed to reduce an estimated 125,000 salmonella infections from chicken and 43,000 from turkey each year, according to USDA. Overall, salmonella causes 1.35 million infections a year, most through food, and about 420 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The withdrawal drew praise from the National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, which said the proposed rule was legally unsound, misinterpreted science, would have increased costs and create more food waste, all \u201cwith no meaningful impact on public health.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to further reducing salmonella and fully support food safety regulations and policies that are based on sound science,\u201d said Ashley Peterson, the group's senior vice president of science and regulatory affairs.",
      "But the move drew swift criticism from food safety advocates, including Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who helped draft the plan.",
      "The withdrawal \"sends the clear message that the Make America Healthy Again initiative does not care about the thousands of people who get sick from preventable foodborne salmonella infections linked to poultry,\" Eskin said in a statement.",
      "The proposed rule had been regarded as a food safety victory similar to a 1994 decision to ban certain strains of dangerous E. coli bacteria from ground beef after deadly outbreaks, said Sarah Sorscher, of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Shipping more salmonella to restaurants and grocery stores is certain to make Americans sicker,\u201d Sorscher said.",
      "Earlier this month, the USDA said it would delay by six months the enforcement of a final rule regulating salmonella levels in certain breaded and stuffed raw chicken products. Enforcement, which was set for May 1, now begins Nov. 3.",
      "That covers foods such as frozen chicken cordon bleu and chicken Kiev dishes that appear to be fully cooked but are only heat-treated to set the batter or coating. Such products have been linked to at least 14 salmonella outbreaks and at least 200 illnesses since 1998, according to the CDC.",

    "story": [
      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they are seeing and hearing increased worries about flying",
      "NEW YORK -- Adelynn Campbell\u2019s last plane trip ended with a panic attack that she got through largely with the help of a kind flight attendant.",
      "That was last year \u2014 before 67 people died in January when an American Airlines jet collided with a helicopter over Washington, D.C., in the deadliest U.S. air disaster in almost a quarter century.",
      "Now, Campbell is even more hesitant to book a flight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely spiked my concern about getting on a plane and it\u2019s making the whole situation a little more stressful than it used to be,\u201d said Campbell, 30, who manages a coffee shop in San Diego.",
      "Being at least a little nervous about flying is understandable. As Mel Brooks once said: \u201cIf God wanted us to fly, He would have given us tickets.\u201d But for some people it causes deep anxiety that could require professional help.",
      "Here's a look at air travel anxiety and ways to cope with it.",
      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they\u2019ve seen and heard increased worries \u2014 and not only in people who already had anxieties about flying.",
      "\u201cEven people who didn\u2019t have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events,\u201d said Jennifer Dragonette, a California-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties.",
      "U.S. air travel was down in March and early April compared with last year, according to TSA statistics. Airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and \u2014 yes \u2014 concern about recent aviation incidents.",
      "FAA officials recently acknowledged they weren\u2019t doing enough to ensure air safety. Recent polling by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that fewer Americans report feeling safe about flying this year.",
      "Flight attendants who work planes out of the Washington, D.C., airport were particularly rattled by the January collision, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union. Some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said.",
      "Fear of flying \u2014 sometimes called aerophobia \u2014 goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. It is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. Many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane.",
      "Some research has suggested it affects about 25 million U.S. adults. Psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didn\u2019t mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged.",
      "In many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities \u2014 like getting married or becoming a parent \u2014 and they start to think that \u201ceverything counts,\u201d said David Carbonell, a Chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears.",
      "A bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said.",
      "Campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. She is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how she\u2019ll be treated by airport security or in other interactions.",
      "Aerophobia can be complicated, Carbonell said. For many people, it\u2019s not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control.",
      "Campbell said that\u2019s what she experiences: \u201cfeeling trapped and unable to breathe.\u201d",
      "Nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers: \u201cWe\u2019ve had people have panic attacks, and we\u2019ve had to give them oxygen. It can be quite intense.\u201d",
      "Statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. According to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics \u2014 making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street.",
      "But experts say you can\u2019t really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder.",
      "Carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients: \u201cI know you already looked at them all, and they\u2019re not helping you.\u201d",
      "For people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. Longer exhales help the body relax, said Dragonette, who counseled Campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a Newport Healthcare residential facility in Temecula, California.",
      "People suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. It can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, Dragonette said.",
      "It\u2019s a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them.",
      "Carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. When they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re keeping a simple count,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re using counting as a proxy for acceptance.\u201d",
      "Nelson, who was a longtime United Airlines flight attendant, says: \u201cI\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019d sort of sit in the aisle and hold someone\u2019s hand.\"",
      "On a Frontier Airlines flight last year from Detroit to San Diego, Campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didn\u2019t halt her panic attack. The passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant.",
      "The flight attendant took deep breaths with Campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down Campbell\u2019s phone number and checked on her a day later.",
      "\u201cI was really impressed,\u201d she said.",

      "The World Food Program and the United Nations refugee agency will slash jobs because of funding cuts, mainly from the United States",
      "CAIRO -- The World Food Program and the United Nations refugee agency will slash jobs because of funding cuts, mainly from the United States, officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday, warning the reductions will severely affect aid programs worldwide.",
      "The WFP, also a United Nations organization, is expected to cut up to 30% of its staff. The head of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it would downsize its headquarters and regional offices to reduce costs by 30% and cut senior-level positions by 50%.",
      "That's according to internal memos obtained by The AP and verified by two U.N. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal personnel decisions.",
      "One WFP official called the cuts \u201cthe most massive\u201d seen by the agency in the past 25 years, and that as a result, operations will disappear or be downsized.",
      "The cuts to the U.N. agencies underscore the impact of President Donald Trump's decision to pull back the U.S. from its position as the world's single largest aid donor. Trump has given billionaire ally Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency power to redo the scale of the federal government, with a focus on slashing foreign assistance. Even before the administration's move, many donor nations had reduced humanitarian spending, and U.N. agencies struggled to reach funding goals.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was \u201cdeeply troubled by the drastic funding reduction.\"",
      "\u201cThe heads of our humanitarian agencies are being forced to take impossibly painful decisions as budget cuts have an immediate and often deadly impact on the world\u2019s most vulnerable,\u201d Dujarric said in a statement to The AP. \u201cWe understand the pressures on national budgets faced by governments, but these cuts come at a time when military spending again hits record levels.\"",
      "The WFP, the world\u2019s largest humanitarian organization, received 46% of its funding from the United States in 2024.",
      "Asked about the planned cuts, the organization said in a statement that \"in this challenging donor environment, WFP will prioritize its limited resources on vital programs that bring urgently needed food assistance to the 343 million people struggling with hunger and increasingly facing starvation.\u201d",
      "The internal memo said personnel cuts will \u201cimpact all geographies, divisions and levels\u201d in the agency. It suggested further downsizing may be needed and said the agency will review its \u201cportfolio of programs.\u201d",
      "The U.N.'s top refugee agency provides help to some 43.7 million refugees worldwide, along with others among the 122 million people driven from their homes by conflicts and natural disasters.",
      "It said a statement that the agency will \u201chave to significantly reduce our workforce,\u201d including downsizing the headquarters and regional offices. UNHCR said some country offices will be closed, but it did not give an immediate figure of how many staff will be cut.",
      "\u201cThe impact of this funding crunch on refugees\u2019 lives is already devastating and will get far worse,\u201d the agency said. Programs providing food, clean water, medicines, emergency shelter and other services \u201cwill reduce or stop.\u201d",
      "For example, it said, reduced funding will cut access to clean water for at least half a million displaced people in Sudan, increasing the risk of cholera and other disease outbreaks.",
      "It also will hurt efforts to house and provide schooling for refugees from Sudan in South Sudan, Chad and Uganda. It warned that the lack of facilities in host countries will push more refugees to attempt dangerous crossings to Europe.",
      "In the April 23 email to staff, the UNHCR chief said the headquarters and regional offices will be downsized to cut costs by 30%. It said senior-level positions will be capped to bring a 50% reduction.",
      "The cuts \u201cwill affect our operations, the size of our organization, and, most worryingly, the very people we are called to protect,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is critical that we prioritize, as we always have, the well-being and safety of refugees and of displaced and stateless people.\u201d",
      "UNHCR\u2019s office in Lebanon \u2014 which is home to some 1 million refugees from Syria \u2014 is only 15% funded, its spokesperson Lisa Abou Khaled said.",
      "This month, it had to stop cash assistance to 347,000 refugees \u2014 two-thirds of the number it previously helped \u2014 and funding for the remaining 200,000 will last only through June, she said. It also halted primary health services for some 40,000 refugees.",
      "The U.N. agency said last month that it had been hit by a 30% decrease in funding for the year, mainly because of U.S. cuts. It said it was ending programs that affect 6,000 personnel and reducing its staff at headquarters by 20%.",

      "Canada\u2019s Liberals are celebrating election victory in a stunning turn of fortune",
      "TORONTO -- As Canada\u2019s Liberals celebrated election victory in a stunning turn of fortune, the country would not know until later Tuesday whether the party of Prime Minister Mark Carney would have an outright majority or need help in Parliament.",
      "Populist Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 in the lead until U.S. President Donald Trump took aim at Canada with a trade war and annexation threats \u2014 was voted out of his Parliament seat in Monday's election.",
      "That capped a swift decline in fortunes for the firebrand Poilievre, who a few months ago appeared to be a shoo-in to become Canada\u2019s next prime minister and shepherd the Conservatives back into power for the first time in a decade.",
      "Poilievre, a career politician, campaigned with Trump-like bravado, taking a page from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president by adopting the slogan \u201cCanada First.\u201d But his similarities to Trump may have ultimately cost him and his party.",
      "The Liberals were projected to win more of Parliament\u2019s 343 seats than the Conservatives. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if they would win an outright majority \u2014 at least 172 seats \u2014 or would need to rely on a smaller party to pass legislation.",
      "Elections Canada said it decided to pause counting of special ballots \u2014 cast by voters who are away from their districts during the election \u2014 until later Tuesday. The Liberals were leading or elected in 168 seats when counting was paused, four short of a majority. Elections Canada estimated that uncounted votes could affect the result in about a dozen districts.",
      "Canadians won\u2019t know until later in the day whether Carney\u2019s Liberals have won a minority or majority mandate.",
      "In a victory speech, Carney stressed unity in the face of Washington\u2019s threats. He said the mutually beneficial system Canada and the U.S. had shared since World War II had ended.",
      "\u201cWe are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,\u201d Carney added. \u201cThese are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never ... ever happen. But we also must recognize the reality that our world has fundamentally changed.\u201d",
      "Poilievre hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity declined toward the end of his decade in power as food and housing prices rose.",
      "But Trump attacked, Trudeau resigned and Carney, a two-time central banker, became the Liberal Party\u2019s leader and prime minister.",
      "In a concession speech before the race call on his own seat, Poilievre vowed to keep fighting for Canadians.",
      "\u201cWe are cognizant of the fact that we didn\u2019t get over the finish line yet,\u201d Poilievre said. \u201cWe know that change is needed, but change is hard to come by. It takes time. It takes work. And that\u2019s why we have to learn the lessons of tonight.\u201d",
      "McGill University political science professor Daniel B\u00e9land said nothing prevents Poilievre from remaining the Conservative leader without a seat but, if he decides to stay, he would need to run in another district \u2014 perhaps by asking a Conservative member of Parliament from a safe Conservative district to resign.",
      "\u201cStill, losing your seat when some people within your own party think you\u2019re the main reason why it failed to win is a clear issue for Poilievre,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "\"Moreover, not having the leader of the official opposition in the House of Commons when Parliament sits again would obviously be a problem for the Conservatives, especially if we do end up with a minority Parliament.\u201d",
      "Even with Canadians grappling with deadly weekend attack at a Vancouver street festival, Trump was trolling them on election day, asserting he was on their ballot and erroneously claiming that the U.S. subsidizes Canada, writing, \u201cIt makes no sense unless Canada is a State!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s truculence has infuriated Canadians, leading many to cancel U.S. vacations, refuse to buy American goods and possibly even vote early. A record 7.3 million Canadians cast ballots before election day.",
      "Reid Warren, a Toronto resident, said he voted Liberal because Poilievre \u201csounds like mini-Trump to me.\u201d He said Trump\u2019s tariffs are a worry.",
      "\u201cCanadians coming together from, you know, all the shade being thrown from the States is great, but it\u2019s definitely created some turmoil, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said.",
      "Foreign policy hasn\u2019t dominated a Canadian election this much since 1988, when, ironically, free trade with the United States was the prevailing issue.",
      "Carney and the Liberals have daunting challenges ahead.",
      "If they don\u2019t win a majority in Parliament, the Liberals might need rely on a smaller party. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which looked set to finish third, is a separatist party from French-speaking Quebec that seeks independence. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals relied on the New Democrats to remain in power for four years, but the progressive party fared poorly on Monday and its leader, Jagmeet Singh, said he was stepping down after eight years in charge.",
      "\u201cIt appears the Liberals will not attain a majority, but the (New Democrats) will prop them up as before. I do not expect any formal deal between the parties,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.",
      "In addition to the trade war with the U.S. and frosty relationship with Trump, Canada is dealing with a cost-of-living crisis. And more than 75% of its exports go to the U.S., so Trump\u2019s tariffs threat and his desire to get North American automakers to move Canada\u2019s production south could severely damage the economy.",
      "Carney has vowed that every dollar the government collects from counter-tariffs on U.S. goods will go toward Canadian workers who are adversely affected. He also said he plans to offer a middle-class tax cut, return immigration to sustainable levels and increase funding to Canada\u2019s public broadcaster.",

      "Table Mountain National Park first reported the fires on Friday. It said in a statement it believed that three fires were started deliberately. Police said they had arrested one person on suspicion of arson.",
      "The city of Cape Town said the latest fires were partly under control but there were fears over more flare-ups. Wildfires there are often fanned by strong coastal winds that can cause them to move swiftly and burn out of control again.",
      "No injuries were reported and no private residences had been damaged, city official JP Smith said. He said four vehicles and a motorcycle in a car park had been destroyed and other cars were damaged.",
      "Authorities closed roads and hiking trails. Nearly 200 people, including some in nursing homes, were evacuated on Sunday but later returned to their residences, the park said.",
      "Table Mountain is susceptible to wildfires in the hot, dry months between November and April. The last major fire on the mountain was in February.",
      "The park estimated that 3,000 hectares (11 square miles) of vegetation have been burned this time. The fires were burning on the back slopes of the mountain and not the famous flat-topped part that overlooks Cape Town's city center.",
      "Around 250 firefighters have responded to the fires, the park said.",
      "Smith said fire crews made progress overnight by using thermal imaging drones to identify the direction the fires were moving.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- The Italian cardinal at the heart of the Vatican\u2019s \u201ctrial of the century\u201d announced Tuesday he was withdrawing from participating in the upcoming conclave to elect a new pope for \u201cthe good of the church.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Angelo Becciu\u2019 s status has dominated discussions in the days after Pope Francis\u2019 death amid questions about whether he would participate in the conclave to elect his successor.",
      "After his 2020 downfall, Becciu had said he would not participate in any future conclave. But in recent days he had asserted he had a right to enter the Sistine Chapel with other cardinals on May 7.",
      "On Tuesday, the 76-year-old Italian issued a statement through his lawyers that said: \u201cHaving at heart the good of the church, which I have served and will continue to serve with fidelity and love, as well as to contribute to the communion and serenity of the conclave, I have decided to obey as I have always done the will of Pope Francis not to enter the conclave while remaining convinced of my innocence.\u201d",
      "Becciu was once an influential Vatican chief of staff who was a leading papal contender himself. But he fell from grace in 2020 when Francis forced him to resign his job as head of the Vatican\u2019s saint-making office and his rights as a cardinal because of allegations of financial misconduct.",
      "Becciu denied wrongdoing but was put on trial in the Vatican criminal court and convicted of finance-related charges in December 2023. He is appealing the conviction and 5 1/2-year prison sentence and had participated in the pre-conclave meetings, including on Monday.",
      "Becciu rose to prominence and power under conservative Pope Benedict XVI and is very much affiliated with the conservative Vatican old guard. While he initially became a close adviser to Pope Francis, Becciu\u2019s subsequent downfall at the hands of Francis might suggest he would vote for someone keen to undo some of Francis\u2019 reforms.",
      "At 76, Becciu is under the age limit of 80 and technically eligible to vote, but the Vatican\u2019s official statistics list him as a \u201cnon-elector.\u201d",
      "The Vatican document regulating a conclave, known by its Latin name Universi Dominici Gregis, lays out the criteria for electors, making clear that 80 cardinals under 80 have the right to elect the pope, except those who have been \u201ccanonically deposed or who with the consent of the Roman Pontiff have renounced the cardinalate.\u201d It adds that after a pope has died, \u201cthe College of Cardinals cannot readmit or rehabilitate them.\u201d",
      "There has never been any clarity on what exactly Becciu renounced or how: The one-line statement issued by the Vatican press office on Sept. 24, 2020, said merely that Francis had accepted Becciu\u2019s resignation as prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints \u201cand his rights connected to the cardinalate.\u201d There is no indication he has been sanctioned canonically.",
      "After he forced Becciu\u2019s resignation, Francis visited Becciu on occasions and allowed him to participate in the life of the Vatican. But Francis also changed Vatican law to allow the city state\u2019s criminal tribunal to prosecute him.",
      "Italian daily Domani reported last week that during the initial pre-conclave discussions, Becciu was presented with two letters signed by Francis before he died indicating he should not participate in the conclave. Becciu's reference of Francis' will in his statement Tuesday suggests that the letters were the tipping point that convinced him to withdraw from the vote.",
      "Questions, meanwhile, have continued to swirl about the integrity of the trial that convicted Becciu and eight others. During the proceedings, the court heard that Francis intervened on several occasions on behalf of the prosecutors and that the prosecution\u2019s prime witness against Becciu was coached and manipulated by outsiders.",
      "The appeal is scheduled to begin in September.",

      "Only cardinals under age 80 are eligible to vote. Current regulations notionally limit the number of electors to 120, but popes often exceeded that ceiling and today there are 135 who are eligible.",
      "Those cardinals who are over 80 can\u2019t vote but can participate in pre-conclave meetings, known as general congregations, in which church problems are discussed. It was in these meetings in 2013 that then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio spoke about the need for the church to go to the \u201cexistential peripheries\u201d to find those who suffer \u2014 an off-the-cuff speech that helped his election.",
      "St. John Paul II rewrote the regulations on papal elections in a 1996 document that remains largely in force today, though Pope Benedict XVI amended it twice before he resigned.",
      "Francis didn't introduce any changes into the conclave itself, though his influence will surely be felt given he named 108 of the 135 cardinal-electors who are eligible to vote.",
      "Benedict's most notable change to the original 1996 document was to exclude the possibility that a pope could be elected by a simple majority if voting was stalemated. Benedict decreed that a two-thirds majority is always needed, no matter how long it takes. He did so to prevent cardinals from holding out for the 12 days foreseen by John Paul and then pushing through a candidate with a slim majority.",
      "If the conclave lasts that long, the top two vote-getters go to a runoff, with a two-thirds majority required to win. Neither of the top two candidates casts a ballot in the runoff.",
      "Any baptized Catholic male is eligible to be pope, but since 1378, only cardinals have been selected. Cardinals over age 80 can be elected pope, even if they can't be in the room to cast a ballot.",
      "Francis and popes before him have upheld the ban on ordaining women as priests, which precludes them from being pope. Under Catholic doctrine, the priesthood is reserved for men because Christ chose only men as his 12 apostles. The teaching is considered divinely inspired and infallible.",
      "Benedict tightened the oath of secrecy in the conclave, making clear that anyone who reveals what went on inside faces automatic excommunication.",
      "In John Paul\u2019s rules, excommunication was always a possibility, but Benedict revised the oath that liturgical assistants and secretaries take to make it explicit, saying they must observe \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy\u201d and explicitly refrain from using any audio or video recording devices.",
      "They now declare: \u201cI take this oath fully aware that an infraction thereof will incur the penalty of automatic excommunication reserved to the Apostolic See. So help me God and these Holy Gospels, which I touch with my hand.\u201d",
      "After the ballots are pierced, they are burned in a cylindrical stove at the end of the voting session. Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney means no decision; white smoke signals the cardinals have chosen a pope and that he has accepted.",
      "Chemical cartridges are added to ensure there is no confusion over the color. To produce black smoke, a cartridge containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene \u2014 the component of coal tar \u2014 and sulfur is burned with the ballots. For white smoke, a cartridge of potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin is burned with the ballots.",
      "Bells also are rung to signal the election of a pope, for further clarity.",
      "The new pope is introduced from the loggia overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square with the words, \u201cHabemus Papam!\u201d (\u201cWe have a pope!\u201d) and his chosen papal name. The new pope then emerges and gives his first blessing.",

      "MADRID -- Power was almost fully restored to Spain and Portugal on Tuesday although many questions remained about what caused one of Europe\u2019s most severe blackouts that grounded flights, paralyzed metro systems, disrupted mobile communications and shut down ATMs across the Iberian Peninsula.",
      "By 7 a.m., more than 99% of energy demand in Spain had been restored, the country's electricity operator Red El\u00e9ctrica said. Portuguese grid operator REN said Tuesday morning all of the 89 power substations were back online since late last night and power had been restored to all 6.4 million customers.",
      "By Tuesday morning, life was returning to normal: schools and offices reopened in Spain, traffic eased along the capital's main arteries and public transport restarted after significant delays.",
      "Spanish authorities did not provide new explanations for what caused the blackout, one of the most serious to ever take place in Europe.",
      "In a televised address Monday night, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the power grid for the Southern European nation of 49 million people lost 15 gigawatts \u2014 equivalent to 60% of its national demand \u2014 in just five seconds.",
      "\u201cWe have never had a complete collapse of the system,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. Authorities were still investigating what happened on Tuesday.",
      "Such widespread electric failure has little precedent on the Iberian Peninsula or in Europe.",
      "On Tuesday, Spain\u2019s meteorological agency AEMET said that it had not detected any \u201cunusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena\u201d on Monday, and no sudden temperature fluctuations were recorded at their weather stations.",
      "Portugal\u2019s National Cybersecurity Center on Monday threw cold water on feverish speculation about foul play, saying there was no sign that the outage resulted from a cyber attack. European Council President Antonio Costa also said there were \u201cno indications of any cyber attack\u201d Monday afternoon.",
      "Teresa Ribera, an executive vice president of the European Commission, also ruled out sabotage. Nonetheless, the outage \u201cis one of the most serious episodes recorded in Europe in recent times,\u201d she said.",
      "At Spain's largest train stations, droves of travelers waited Tuesday morning to board trains, or to rebook tickets for journeys that were canceled or disrupted on Monday and return home.",
      "At Atocha station in Madrid, hundreds of people stood near screens waiting for updates. Many had spent the night at the station, wrapped in blankets provided by the Red Cross around 1 a.m. Tuesday morning for those who had to wait overnight thanks to canceled trains. Similar scenes played out at Barcelona's Sants station.",
      "The Madrid Open tennis tournament being held this week was still affected by the power outage Tuesday after its cancellation the previous day. Tournament organizers delayed opening its doors.",
      "By 11 a.m. Tuesday, service on Madrid's metro system was fully restored. In Barcelona, the system was operating normally but commuter trains were suspended due to \u201celectrical instability,\u201d the company that runs the service, Rodalies Catalunya, said on X.",
      "In some parts of the country, commuter and mid-distance services were still suspended or running at reduced capacity.",
      "Emergency workers in Spain said they had rescued some 35,000 passengers on Monday stranded along railways and underground, with the blackout turning sports centers, train stations and airports into makeshift overnight refuges.",
      "On Monday, Rub\u00e9n Cari\u00f3n was stranded on a commuter train outside Madrid, when he pried the window open and walked to the nearest transit station by foot. Then, he spent the night in the city's Atocha station after his train back to Barcelona was canceled.",
      "The 24-year-old said he chose to wait overnight at the station instead of a hotel so he could stay updated on when he could board a train home, describing his experience as \u201cpure chaos.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is pushing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to cede territory occupied by Russia to Moscow to bring about an end to the fighting in Ukraine",
      "LONDON -- President Donald Trump is pushing Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the war, threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult \u2014 and causing alarm bells in Europe about how to fill the gap.",
      "Ukraine's European allies view the war as fundamental to the continent's security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily \u2014 regardless of whether Trump pulls out.",
      "Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of prolonging the \u201ckilling field\u201d by pushing back on his demand that Ukraine hand over occupied Crimea to Moscow.",
      "Trump\u2019s land-for-peace plan would mark a significant shift in the post-World War II order, ripping up conventions that have long held that borders should not be redrawn by force.",
      "\u201cIt took a World War to roll back de jure annexations and 60 million people died,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, referring to the pre-war annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany.",
      "\u201cEuropeans will not accept it\" and Ukraine will not either, he said.",
      "Diplomats and experts described various scenarios if the U.S. decides to walk. They range from the U.S. ceasing direct aid to Ukraine \u2014 but allowing European nations to pass on critical American intelligence and weapons to Kyiv \u2014 to Trump banning transfers of any American technology, including components or software in European weapons.",
      "Any withdrawal of U.S. military aid to Ukraine could create serious difficulties for Europe, analysts and diplomats told The Associated Press. Kyiv's ability to keep fighting would depend on European political will to muster money and weapons \u2014 and how quickly the gaps left by Washington can be filled.",
      "If it were easy, Europe would \u201calready be doing things without America,\u201d said a European diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.",
      "No new U.S. aid package for Ukraine has been approved since Trump came into office, even as European nations have collectively provided Ukraine with more aid than Washington, according to the Keil Institute.",
      "Europe has contributed around $157 billion, some $26 billion more than the U.S., although Washington slightly outpaces Europe when it comes to military aid, the Germany-based institute said.",
      "It will be hard, but there are ways Europe can find cash to fund Ukraine \u2014 including seizing frozen Russian assets \u2014 but \u201cmoney isn't what you shoot bullets with,\u201d Heisbourg said.",
      "Europe\u2019s \"big mistake\" was undertaking major military downsizing following the Cold War and thinking \u201cthis war started in February 2022 and not in February 2014,\u201d when Moscow invaded and then annexed Crimea, said Thomas Gomart, director of IFRI, a French international affairs think tank.",
      "Europeans are scrambling to acquire weapons for themselves and for Ukraine, while confronting constraints on production capacity, a fragmented defense industry and a decades-long reliance on the U.S.",
      "Some extra production capacity could come from Ukraine, which has ramped up manufacturing of ammunition and drones since Russia's invasion. Much harder to replace, experts said, are advanced American weapons, including air defenses.",
      "Russia has attacked Ukraine almost nightly since Putin\u2019s forces invaded in February 2022, flooding the skies with missiles and drones, including dummy attack drones to exhaust Ukraine's limited air defenses. In April, at least 57 people were killed in multiple strikes.",
      "The death toll from the Russian attacks would \u201cinevitably\u201d be higher without the American Patriot air-defense missile systems protecting Ukraine's skies, said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "The Patriots can track and intercept Russian missiles, including the hypersonic Kinzhal, which Putin has boasted was unstoppable. Kyiv uses them to protect critical infrastructure, including the country's energy grid.",
      "Earlier this month, Zelenskyy asked to buy 10 Patriots, a request Trump dismissed. \u201cYou don\u2019t start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" he said, a day after a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy killed 35 people.",
      "France and Italy have given Ukraine their Aster SAMP/T air-defense system but the issue is not \u201cquality, it\u2019s quantity,\u201d Barrie said, pointing to the larger U.S. defense industrial base and greater U.S. stockpiles.",
      "Although Trump criticized Putin over the weekend for his missile strikes and suggested imposing more sanctions on Russia, for Europe it remains a wait-and-see game.",
      "The whiplash of Trump's aggressive foreign policy means nothing is off the cards, experts said.",
      "A worst-case scenario could see a ban on American weapons exports and transfers to Ukraine, which would bar European nations from buying U.S. weapons to give to Kyiv or transferring weapons with American components or software, Barrie said.",
      "That could mean countries, including Germany, that have already given American Patriots to Ukraine would be prohibited from doing so. Such a move would seriously hamper Europe's ability to support Kyiv and mark a fundamental shift in America's relationship with its allies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the U.S. to cease to be an ally, it is another for the U.S. to be an enemy,\u201d Heisbourg said, noting that such a step could also damage the U.S. defense sector if weapons purchases were perceived to be unusable on Trump\u2019s political order.",
      "In March, the Trump administration suspended intelligence sharing with Ukraine in a bid to force Zelenskyy to accept a truce with Russia. The about weeklong suspension impacted Ukraine's ability to track and target Russian troops, tanks and ships.",
      "There are certain capabilities, including \u201chigher-end\u201d surveillance and reconnaissance using satellites that \u201conly the United States can provide,\u201d said Matthew Kroenig, vice president of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security in Washington.",
      "While the extent of intelligence sharing between the U.S. and Ukraine is not known, experts said it likely shows Kyiv near real-time buildup of Russian troop deployments and helps target long-range strikes.",
      "Ukraine's allies do not have as much satellite capability as the U.S. but could launch more, or Ukraine could use commercial systems if Trump cuts off intelligence again, experts said. The latter would likely have to come from a European provider \u2014 in March, the American satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies confirmed it temporarily suspended access to unclassified satellite images following the administration's decision to pull intelligence sharing.",
      "Ukraine also needs an alternative to Elon Musk's satellite network Starlink, which is critical for Ukrainian defensive and civilian communications. European defense companies are discussing creating a satellite alliance but don't currently have an alternative on the same scale.",
      "If Trump walks away, or if Kyiv rejects a deal and keeps fighting with European support, it won\u2019t necessarily mean \"the collapse of Ukraine\" although more people will almost certainly die if the U.S. pulls its air defenses and intelligence-sharing capabilities, Heisbourg said.",
      "Trump has jolted European leaders into awareness that they need to take responsibility for their own defense, regardless of who occupies the White House, experts said.",
      "That means European nations need to invest more in defense, work together to scale up military production and build trust to share intelligence.",
      "\u201cThis issue is not a question about the next two months or the next two years. This issue is about the next two decades,\u201d Gomart said.",

      "In his first 100 days back in the White House, the U.S. president has lobbed barbs at America's northern neighbor, levied tariffs on Canadian goods and talked about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "It had many Canadian voters thinking about Trump and how the parties on the ballot would respond to him. Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals won over Conservative opposition leader Pierre Poilievre, a dramatic reversal of fortune credited largely to Trump.",
      "Here are some voices from voters casting their ballots in Monday's elections:",

      "Warren, who works at a wholesale food distribution center, said he did feel somewhat boosted by unity among Canadians created by \u201call the shade being thrown from the States,\u201d but \u2018it's definitely created some turmoil, that\u2019s for sure.\"",

      "HONG KONG -- Four former Hong Kong lawmakers were freed from prison on Tuesday, having served more than four years for their conviction under a Beijing-imposed law that crushed a once-thriving pro-democracy movement.",
      "Claudia Mo, Jeremy Tam, Kwok Ka-ki and Gary Fan were among 47 activists arrested in 2021 for their roles in an unofficial primary election. They were the first of the convicted activists to reunite with their families and friends following years of separation.",
      "Only vehicles involved in the release operation were seen leaving the three prisons in the remote areas of the Asian financial hub under tight security. The curtains of the vehicles were down. Reporters who waited for hours outside the prisons where they were held were unable to see them in person around the facilities.",
      "An Associated Press reporter saw Mo's husband, Philip Bowring, waiting for the activist to return home at their residence before being escorted by police out of the area where they live.",
      "In a video posted by local online media HK01, Fan, when asked by a reporter about his feelings, thanked Hong Kongers and the media for their concern. He added he was going to reunite with his family.",
      "The 2020 unofficial primary drew 610,000 voters, and its winners had been expected to advance to the official legislative election. Authorities postponed that, however, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "During the trial, prosecutors said the activists aimed to paralyze Hong Kong\u2019s government and force the city\u2019s leader to resign by aiming to win a legislative majority and using it to block government budgets indiscriminately. The judges said in their verdict last year that the activists\u2019 plans to effect change through the unofficial primary would have undermined the government\u2019s authority and created a constitutional crisis.",
      "Only two of the 47 original defendants were acquitted. The remaining activists received prison terms ranging from four years and two months to 10 years on a charge of conspiracy to commit subversion. Mo, Tam, Kwok and Fan, who got the shortest terms, had their sentences reduced after pleading guilty.",
      "Regardless of their term length, years of separation have pained the activists and their families. The case involved democracy advocates across the spectrum. They include legal scholar Benny Tai, who got a 10-year prison term, and former student leader Joshua Wong, who has to serve four years and eight months.",
      "Fourteen of the convicted activists would appeal their cases. The government lawyers would also appeal the acquittal of one activist.",
      "Critics said their convictions illustrated how authorities crushed dissent following massive anti-government protests in 2019, alongside media crackdowns and reduced public choice in elections. The drastic political changes reflect that the Western-style civil liberties Beijing promised to retain in the former British colony for 50 years when it returned to China in 1997 were shrinking, they said.",
      "Beijing and Hong Kong governments insisted the national security law was necessary for the city\u2019s stability. China defended the judicial decisions, despite criticism from foreign governments.",

      "CAIRO -- Sudan\u2019s notorious paramilitary group killed at least 30 people in an attack on Omdurman, the sister city of the capital, Khartoum, the authorities and an activist group said on Monday.",
      "Rapid Support Forces are alleged to have kidnapped dozens of people, including women, from Salha, an area in the southern part of Omdurman on Sunday morning, according to the Resistance Committees activist group. It is the latest incident in a series of deadly attacks by the group this month.",
      "Footage circulated online showed fighters wearing RSF uniforms holding dozens of men \u2014 some half-naked \u2014 in an open area, with bodies lying on the ground.",
      "In a statement, the RSF didn\u2019t deny the killing, but sought to distance itself from the perpetrators, saying those who appeared in the footage \u201care not affiliated with our forces in any way whatsoever.\u201d",
      "The Sudan War Monitor, an online group tracking the conflict, said it geolocated the video footage to about five kilometers (three miles) south of Omdurman Islamic University, which remains a frontline area controlled by the RSF.",
      "The foreign ministry on Monday condemned the attacks and called for the international community to declare the RSF as a terrorist organisation.",
      "\u201cThis heinous crime, and the militia\u2019s rhetoric about it, which reflects its contempt for human values, leave no justification for not branding the militia as a terrorist group,\u201d a ministry statement said.",
      "The military has regained control of most of the northern and western areas of Omdurman as part of its sweeping advances in recent months in Khartoum and other urban areas. The RSF still has pockets in the southern part of Omdurman.",
      "The attack was the latest in Sudan\u2019s ongoing war which broke out in April 2023 after simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare across the country.",
      "Since then, at least 24,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher. The war has driven about 13 million people from their homes, including four million crossed into neighboring countries. It also pushed parts of the country into famine.",

      "LONDON -- Lawyers for an Egyptian poet and activist who has been allegedly detained and held in solitary confinement without charge in the United Arab Emirates for over 100 days have filed a legal challenge in the U.K. against UAE authorities.",
      "The filing was made Friday on behalf of Abdulrahman al-Qaradawi, an outspoken critic of Egypt\u2019s government who had been residing in Turkey. It urges London's Metropolitan Police to launch a criminal investigation into the activist's alleged abduction, torture and extradition to the UAE.",
      "Al-Qaradawi was detained in Lebanon on Dec. 28 as he was returning from Syria. He had reportedly visited Syria to join celebrations after the downfall of President Bashar Assad in a lightning insurgent offensive.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s Cabinet deported him to the United Arab Emirates on Jan. 8. Since then he has been held alone \u201cwithout charge, without due process, and under psychological pressure,\u201d his lawyer said, adding that amounts to torture under international law.",
      "\u201cAbdulrahman was taken from his family, forcibly removed across borders and thrown into solitary confinement in a country where he is not a citizen and there is no evidence he has committed any crime,\" said his lawyer, Rodney Dixon. \u201cThis is not extradition; it\u2019s abduction in plain sight.\u201d",
      "Dixon is pressing U.K. police to open an investigation under Britain's universal jurisdiction laws, which allow governments to prosecute people for the most serious crimes regardless of where they are allegedly committed.",
      "The complaint names the UAE Ministry of Interior, as well as former Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who approved the activist's extradition from Lebanon to the UAE, and Royel Jet LLC, the company that provided the private aircraft for the extradition, as responsible parties.",
      "All have business or other links with the U.K. and could be arrested and prosecuted if they travel to Britain.",
      "\u201cWhat we are hoping is that based on the evidence we have, the Metropolitan Police will commence an investigation into these persons and entities and then to seek arrest warrants,\u201d Dixon said.",
      "Al-Qaradawi\u2019s late father, Youssef al-Qaradawi, was a senior and controversial Egyptian cleric revered by the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood.",
      "Abdulrahman al-Qaradawi was wanted in Egypt on charges of disseminating false news and inciting violence, for which he was convicted and sentenced in absentia to five years in prison.",
      "U.N. special rapporteurs have expressed concern over al-Qaradawi's case, and dozens of rights organizations have written a joint letter to UAE authorities calling for information on his whereabouts and his immediate release.",
      "Amnesty International has said that while visiting Damascus in December, al-Qaradawi had filmed himself criticizing the authorities of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. The rights group said the video may have triggered his arrest.",
      "A spokesman for Mikati said in a statement that it was not his personal decision to extradite the activist, and that the Lebanese Council of Ministers had followed due process in deciding to approve his transfer to the UAE.",
      "The UAE government did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "TOKYO -- A climber airlifted with altitude sickness from near the peak of Japan's Mount Fuji last week returned to the slope and was rescued for a second time just four days later, authorities said Monday.",
      "Officials urged people to be aware of the harsh conditions at the country\u2019s tallest peak during its off-season.",
      "The climber was identified only as a 27-year-old Chinese student living in Japan. He made an emergency call on April 22 and was airlifted after developing symptoms of altitude sickness, police said, adding that his climbing irons also were damaged.",
      "On Saturday, he returned to the mountain's Fujinomiya trail about 3,000 meters (nearly 10,000 feet) above sea level to look for his cell phone and other belongings left behind, Shizuoka prefectural police said. Another climber found him there unable to move after he apparently developed altitude sickness for a second time, police said.",
      "The mountain's hiking trails are officially open only from July to early September, but there is no penalty for hiking off-season. There also is no charge or penalty when a climber needs to be rescued, but the Chinese student's case prompted an uproar on social media and generated calls for him to be charged, at least for his second rescue.",
      "The Shizuoka police urged all climbers to use caution, noting that the mountain has low temperatures and is covered in snow even in spring.",
      "The 3,776-meter-high (12,388-foot-high ) mountain was designated a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site in 2013. A symbol of Japan, the mountain called \u201cFujisan\u201d used to be a place of pilgrimage and is increasingly popular among hikers today.",
      "To control overcrowding and risks from rushed overnight climbing through rocky slopes to see the sunrise, local authorities last year introduced an entry fee and cap on the number of entrants on the most popular trail and will introduce similar rules on other main trails this year.",

      "NATO leaders have always insisted that membership should be discussed solely among allies and candidates and that Moscow can have no say, but recently it\u2019s become a bargaining chip in talks between the United States, Russia and Ukraine.",
      "NATO was formed in 1949 as a bulwark against aggression in Europe by the Soviet Union. Former West Germany sought protection as its 15th member on May 6, 1955, as concern grew about the Soviet army massed east of the iron curtain.",

      "Buddhist rites were performed during the service on Monday. His body will be transported to his ancestral homeland in Shunde district, Guangdong province, the coastal region in southern China across from Hong Kong where Lee, like so many top Hong Kong business leaders, was born. He moved to the city in 1948, one year before the communists swept to power in mainland China, targeting land owners as they went, and became a key player in the city's real estate industry.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran finally extinguished a fire Monday at a southern port rocked by an explosion as the death toll in the blast rose to at least 65 people killed, authorities said.",
      "Satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press also showed the devastation of the explosion that injured more than 1,000 people. The photos from Planet Labs PBC came as local news reports from the site raised more questions about the cause of the blast Saturday at the Shahid Rajaei port near Bandar Abbas.",
      "Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni announced the fire had been put out, while Hormozgan Gov. Mohammad Ashouri Taziani gave the death toll.",
      "The port reportedly took in a chemical component needed for solid fuel for ballistic missiles \u2014 something denied by authorities though they've not explained the source of the power that caused such destruction.",
      "The blast Saturday disintegrated a building next to the blast site, which appeared to be in a row where other containers once stood, the satellite photos showed. It also shredded the majority of another building just to the west.",
      "The force of the blast also could be seen, with what appeared to be two craters measure some 50 meters (165 feet) across. Other containers nearby appeared smashed and distended by the explosion and the intense fire that followed.",
      "The fire still burned at the site Monday, some two days after the initial explosion that happened just as Iran began a third round of negotiations with the United States over its rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "Authorities still haven't offered an explanation for the explosion.",
      "Private security firm Ambrey says the port received missile fuel chemical in March. It was part of a shipment of ammonium perchlorate from China by two vessels to Iran, first reported in January by the Financial Times. The chemical used to make solid propellant for rockets was going to be used to replenish Iran\u2019s missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Iranian military denied receiving the chemical shipment.",
      "Social media footage of the explosion saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation. That suggests a chemical compound being involved in the blast, like in the 2020 Beirut port explosion.",
      "Late Sunday, Iran's semiofficial ILNA news agency quoted Saeed Jafari, the CEO of marine services company working at the port, as saying there were false statements about the cargo that detonated, which he called \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe incident happened following a false statement about the dangerous goods and delivering it without documents and tags,\u201d Jafari said.",
      "Another report by the semiofficial ISNA news agency claimed the cargo that caused the blast was not reported to customs authorities as well.",

      "ROME -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Tuesday observed the formal exchange of a dozen cooperation agreements, including on defense, as part of efforts to strengthen ties between the two Mediterranean nations.",
      "Erdogan was in Rome to attend a fourth so-called Intergovernmental Summit between Italy and Turkey that aims to boost trade and cooperation.",
      "His visit comes at a time when Turkey and Italy have expanded defense partnerships. In March, Turkey\u2019s leading drone manufacturer, Baykar, reached a memorandum of understanding for a joint venture with Italy\u2019s Leonardo for production of unmanned aerial vehicles. Last year, Baykar bought Italian aircraft producer Piaggio Aerospace.",
      "Speaking after their meeting, Meloni and Erdogan said that Turkey and Italy have successfully reached their $30 billion trade volume target and have now set a new goal of $40 billion, signaling further economic collaboration.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to strengthen our cooperation with Italy, which has made significant progress in the field of defense industry, with new partnerships and projects,\u201d Erdogan said.",
      "Italy sees Turkey as a key partner in managing migration numbers and maintaining stability in the region.",
      "On Tuesday, Meloni thanked Erdogan, saying joint measures by Turkey and Italy had resulted in the number of migrants originating from Turkey dropping to \u201czero.\u201d",
      "Erdogan said: \u201cWe will continue our cooperation with Italy in the field of combating irregular migration in the coming period.\u201d",
      "The Turkish leader also said that the sides had discussed possible cooperation toward Syria\u2019s redevelopment and would hold more consultations on the issue.",

      "U.S. employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, down from 7.5 million in February and 8.1 million in March 2024, the Labor Department reported Tuesday. It was the fewest number of openings since September and below the 7.5 million that economists had forecast.",

      "The American job market has proven remarkably resilient. Companies, nonprofits and government agencies continued hire in the face of high interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve to combat a resurgence of inflation.",
      "The economic outlook is uncertain, largely because of Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 huge taxes on imports, purges of federal workers and the deportation of immigrants working in the United States illegally.",
      "Still, federal job cuts by billionaire Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency didn't have much impact in the March numbers; federal layoffs actually dipped to 8,000 from February's 19,000, which had been the most since November 2020.",
      "\u201cThe job market is continuing to hold its own, but barely,\u201d said Robert Frick, economist with the Navy Federal Credit Union. \u201cWhile job openings dropped below forecasts, they haven\u2019t hit a post-COVID low.",
      "\u201cHiring holds steady and layoffs dipped a bit, showing that, overall, employers are clinging to the employees they have.

      "The Novavax vaccine, which originally showed effectiveness in a nearly 30,000-person clinical trial, is still being sold under emergency use authorization in the U.S. The nation's other two options, mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.",
      "Because the coronavirus continually mutates, manufacturers follow instructions from FDA to make one change each year to their recipe \u2014 which strain to target \u2014 just like flu vaccines.",
      "The FDA was on track to grant Novavax full approval by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But Trump appointees directed FDA scientists to pause their decision, according to one of the people. Since that highly unusual move, Novavax and the agency have been discussing additional requirements for approval.",
      "In his weekend tweet, FDA's Makary referred to the Novavax vaccine as \u201ca new product,\u201d presumably because it had been updated to match last year's common coronavirus strain.",
      "\u201cNew products require new clinical studies,\u201d Makary added.",
      "An administration spokesman didn't respond to specific questions about Pfizer and Moderna but suggested all COVID-19 vaccines could face stricter requirements.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now been years since COVID has presented the threat it once did, and the urgency to rush approval of boosters without normal oversight no longer exists,\u201d said Andrew Nixon, a Health and Human Services spokesman, in a statement.",
      "The FDA had been treating the annual COVID-19 strain updates exactly as it's done for decades with flu vaccines \u2014 not as new products, but existing ones that are merely adjusted to protect against the latest strains, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Offit said the companies still must perform tests in small numbers of people that show these updated vaccines produce levels of virus-fighting antibodies known to be protective, and they're closely monitored for safety.",
      "Nixon, the HHS spokesman, suggested the policy might not apply to the flu shot, \u201cwhich has been tried and tested for more than 80 years.\u201d",
      "Under federal law, the FDA is required to follow established procedures when issuing requirements to drugmakers for approval. If the agency skips certain steps or imposes additional requirements for political reasons, experts say, it could be sued by drugmakers \u2014 or even patients, such as those who prefer the Novavax vaccine over its competitors because of an allergy or some other reason.",
      "In addition to large clinical trials conducted before all three COVID-19 vaccines were cleared for use, there's data on real-world use, said former Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, who oversaw COVID-19 vaccine policy during the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cAt the point where I had left, we had put some 700 million COVID vaccines into the arms of Americans,\u201d he said. \"That\u2019s a pretty good size clinical trial.\"",

      "The Trump administration raised tariffs on goods from China to 145% in early April",
      "NEW YORK -- Major orders canceled. Containers of products left stranded overseas. No roadmap for what comes next.",
      "The Trump administration raised tariffs on goods from China to 145% in early April. Since then, small business owners who depend on imports from China to survive have become increasingly desperate as they eye dwindling inventory and skyrocketing invoices.",
      "President Donald Trump seemed to back down somewhat last week when he said he expected the tariffs to come down \u201csubstantially.\u201d That helped set off a rally in the stock market. But for small businesses that operate on razor-thin margins, the back and forth is causing massive upheaval. Some say they could be just months from going out of business altogether.",
      "Game makers are particularly susceptible to the tariffs since the majority of games and toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, according to The Toy Association.",
      "WS Game Co., based in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, is a family-owned business that licenses Hasbro board games like Monopoly, Candy Land and Scrabble and creates deluxe versions of them. Its most popular line of games come in boxes that look like vintage books and sell for $40.",
      "The company\u2019s games were featured in Oprah\u2019s Favorite Things list in 2024 and sold in 14,000 stores in North America, from big national chains to mom-and-pop stores, said owner Jonathan Silva, whose father founded the company in 2000.",
      "All of WS Game\u2019s production is done in China. The tariffs have brought the past 25 years of healthy growth to a screeching halt.",
      "Over the past three weeks, WS Game has had three containers of finished games, worth $500,000, stranded in China. It lost orders from three of the largest U.S. retailers totaling $16 million in business. And there\u2019s not much Silva can do about it.",
      "\u201cAs a small business, we don\u2019t have the runway or the capabilities to move manufacturing on a whim,\u201d said Silva, who has 22 employees. He said the tariffs have \u201cdisrupted our business and put us on the verge of insolvency\u201d and estimates he has about a four-month runway to stay afloat if nothing changes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really hoping that cooler heads prevail,\u201d he said.",
      "Jeremy Rice co-owns House, a home-d\u00e9cor shop in Lexington, Kentucky, that specializes in artificial flower arrangements for the home. About 90% of the flowers his business uses are made in China.",
      "Rice uses dozens of vendors. The largest are absorbing some of the cost of the tariffs and passing on the rest. One vendor is raising prices by 20% and another 25%. But Rice is expecting smaller vendors to increase prices by much higher percentages.",
      "House offers mid-range artificial flowers. A large hydrangea head will retail for $10 to $16, for example. China is the only place that manufacturers higher quality silk flowers. It would take a vendor years to open a factory in a different country or move production somewhere else, Rice said.",
      "Rice ordered his holiday d\u00e9cor early this year. But even after stocking up ahead of the tariffs, he only has enough everyday floral inventory in to last two to three months.",
      "\u201cAfter that, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Rice is concerned that the trade war will wipe out a bunch of mom-and-pop stores, similar to what happened in the Great Recession and the pandemic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to turn, there\u2019s nothing to do,\u201d he said.",
      "A tea shop in a Michigan college town is also caught in the middle of the ongoing tariff fight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically just put a big pit in my stomach,\u201d said Lisa McDonald, owner of TeaHaus, located in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan. McDonald has owned TeaHaus for nearly 18 years and sells tea to customers across the U.S.",
      "Americans drank about 86 billion servings of tea in 2024, according to the Tea Association of the U.S.A.. Almost all of that is imported since tea isn\u2019t grown in the U.S. at scale, due to factors ranging from climate to cost.",
      "McDonald imports loose-leaf tea from China, India, Kenya, Sri Lanka and other countries. She says her customer base is \u201cfrom all over the U.S. and the world.\" But she worries there is a limit to what they\u2019ll spend. Her premium teas can cost up to $33 for a 50-gram bag.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I can charge $75 for a 50-gram bag of tea, no matter how amazing that tea is,\u201d she said.",
      "McDonald understands Trump\u2019s rationale for wanting to use tariffs to spur U.S. manufacturing but says it doesn\u2019t apply to the tea industry.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t grow tea in the U.S. to the extent that we need. We can\u2019t just flip the industry and \u2018make tea great again\u2019 in America. It just can\u2019t happen,\u201d she said.",
      "Jim Umlauf\u2019s business, 4Knines, based in Oklahoma City, makes vehicle seat covers and cargo liners for dog owners and others. To do so, he needs raw materials such as fabric, coatings and components from China.",
      "Umlauf has explored manufacturing in countries other than China since 2018, when Trump first instituted a 25% tariff on goods from China, but has run into complications. In the meantime, 4Knines absorbs the extra cost, which Umlauf says has limited its growth and squeezed its margins.",
      "Now, the new tariffs make it nearly impossible to do business. The demand is there, but the company can\u2019t afford to bring over more products.",
      "\u201cWe only have a limited amount of inventory left, and without some relief, we\u2019ll run out soon,\u201d Umlauf said.",
      "As a small business owner who has worked hard to develop a high-quality brand, create jobs and contribute to the community, Umlauf is frustrated. He has tried to contact the White House and other decision-makers to ask for small business support. But he's gotten zero response.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for policymakers to consider the full impact of trade policies not just on stock prices or global competitiveness, but on the real people running small businesses,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "A Texas judge has thrown out a federal rule that would have capped credit card late fees at $8",
      "NEW YORK -- A Texas judge earlier this month threw out a federal rule that would have capped credit card late fees at $8.",
      "The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau finalized the rule last year as part of the Biden administration's efforts to do away with what it called junk fees. It was paused by the courts before it could take effect.",
      "At the time, the CFPB estimated that American families would have saved more than $10 billion in late fees annually had the fees been capped at $8, significantly less than the $32 average.",
      "Banks and industry groups argued that the rule didn't allow card issuers to charge fees high enough to deter late payments and discourage repeat violations.",
      "The Texas judge's ruling earlier this month came a day after a collection of major industry groups and the CFPB under President Donald Trump announced that they had reached an agreement to throw out the rule.",
      "Here's what to know about credit card late fees:",
      "The average late fee for major issuers has steadily ticked up since the 2010s, going from $23 at the end of 2010 to $32 in 2022, according to the CFPB. WalletHub, which tracks financial data, found the average late fee in 2025 to be $30.50, with the maximum $41.",
      "A September 2023 Consumer Reports study estimated that 1 in 5 American adults, or about 52 million people, paid a credit card late fee in the previous year. People with lower incomes pay proportionately bigger fees, according to the CFPB, with the highest burden falling on communities of color and those living paycheck to paycheck.",
      "Enrolling in auto-pay for your credit cards can help you avoid making late payments, and there are some credit cards that don't charge late fees at all (though it's important to note that these cards may have other fee or penalty structures, or higher interest rates.)",
      "Citi Simplicity and the Apple card do not currently charge late fees, and Discover offers a card that will automatically waive the first late fee.",
      "It's also possible to appeal credit card late fees charged by your credit card company by calling them directly. The companies will often reverse the fees, especially if it's your first late payment.",
      "You may also want to consider making payments on your credit card balances during the month. That means you'll have paid more of the balance by the time the amount comes due, and keeping your balance low relative to your credit limit can improve your credit score.",
      "If you're having trouble making ends meet, you can ask your credit issuers about hardship programs. These are typically available to people affected by job loss, illness or medical conditions, natural disasters, or other emergencies.",
      "Concerned that credit card companies were building a business model based on high penalties, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act), which banned the companies from charging excessive late fees and established clearer disclosures and consumer protections.",
      "In 2010, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors voted to issue a regulation implementing the CARD Act, which said that banks could only charge fees to recover costs associated with late payment.",
      "However, the rule included an \u201cimmunity provision\u201d that let some banks charge $25 for the first late payment and $35 for subsequent late payments, adjusted for inflation each year. Those amounts subsequently grew to $30 and $41.",
      "After a review of market data, the CFPB finalized a rule that would have capped late fees at $8 and ended automatic inflation adjustments. Based on records analyzed by the CFPB, a late fee of $8 would be sufficient for card issuers, on average, to cover collection costs incurred as a result of late payments.",
      "Industry groups, including the Consumer Bankers Association, American Bankers Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and others, said they welcomed the court's decision eliminating the cap.",
      "The groups said that the rule would have led to higher interest rates and reduced credit access for card holders. The groups also said the rule would have \u201creduced important incentives for consumers to manage their finances.\u201d",
      "The CFPB has estimated that banks bring in roughly $14 billion in credit card late fees a year.",
      "Horacio M\u00e9ndez, president and CEO of Woodstock Institute, an organization for advancing economic equity, called the ruling a \u201cdevastating blow.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy tossing out the CFPB\u2019s common-sense rule to cap these predatory late fees \u2014 some as high as $41 \u2014 a federal judge is putting corporations over the lives of everyday consumers,\" he said. \u201cThe CFPB\u2019s rule was borne out of clear evidence: the credit card industry was using inflated late fees as a profit engine, forcing families with the least financial cushion to pay.\u201d",
      "M\u00e9ndez said that while consumers have come to expect fees for services, those fees needn't be punitive to be effective.",

      "Horror movies are often one-week wonders at the box office, but Ryan Coogler\u2019s\u201cSinners\u201d is defying the odds and proving to be true event cinema.",
      "In its second weekend in theaters, \u201cSinners\u201d earned $45 million in ticket sales from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. That\u2019s down a miniscule 6% from its Easter holiday launch, the smallest drop in any genre since \u201cAvatar\u201d in 2009. Worldwide, \u201cSinners\u201d has now made $161.6 million.",
      "For the industry, the showing proves the film's reach has broadened beyond horror fans to mainstream audiences wanting to see what the hype is about. Last weekend, men made up 56% of the audience. This weekend, the gender divide narrowed to 50/50. Premium large format showings, like the 70mm IMAX screens, are also a big draw. IMAX screens worldwide accounted for some 21% of the second weekend globally, a nearly 9% increase from last weekend.",
      "The original ensemble movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as twins, rode into theaters on a wave of great reviews. And, to be fair, \u201cSinners\u201d isn\u2019t simply a horror film: It blends elements of drama, action and musical into its southern gothic milieu.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of the lowest second weekend holds for an overperforming wide release ever,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute phenomenon.\"",
      "Hollywood expects significant drop off in a movie's second week of release. Even a 50% dip is considered a solid number, baked into the movie math. When it's anything less than that, it's notable.",
      "\u201cYou can buy a great opening weekend with marketing, but if a movie doesn\u2019t have the goods, it\u2019ll drop off,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThere's no greater barometer of success than a second weekend hold like this.\"",
      "The film was produced by Coogler\u2019s Proximity Media and Warner Bros., which handled the theatrical release. After some disappointments earlier in the year, it's the second major win for the studio after \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d helped energize the box office earlier this month.",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d easily topped the biggest new competition this week: \u201cThe Accountant 2,\u201d a sequel starring Ben Affleck and released by Amazon MGM Studios, which opened in third place with an estimated $24.5 million in its first weekend. Gavin O'Connor directed the film, which played in 3,610 theaters in North America. Audiences gave it a promising A- CinemaScore.",
      "The film that beat \u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d for second place was a 20-year-old Star Wars movie: \u201cRevenge of the Sith.\u201d The anniversary re-release took in an estimated $25.2 million over the weekend, with many sellouts reported, more than doubling last year\u2019s release of \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d Internationally, it earned $17 million from 34 territories, giving it a $42.2 million global weekend. It's one of the top grossing re-releases ever.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d landed in fourth place with $22.7 million, bringing its domestic total to around $380 million.",
      "The scary video game adaptation \u201cUntil Dawn\u201d also opened this weekend to an estimated $8 million. Sony Pictures released the film, starring Ella Rubin and Michael Cimino, which has earned $18.1 million globally.",
      "The \u201cMinecraft\u201d and \u201cSinners\u201d wins have meant a huge boost for the April box office, which is up 102% from April 2024. The annual box office is also up over 10% from last year after running at a double-digit deficit in March. And this is all happening right before the industry\u2019s summer movie season kicks off on May 2 with Disney\u2019s \u201cThunderbolts(asterisk).\u201d",

      "The U.S. coal industry has been in a steep decline for decades, and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed several changes that would affect it",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- President Donald Trump's administration has proposed several changes that would affect the struggling U.S. coal industry.",
      "Trump issued executive orders this month to allow mining on federal land. He has used his emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep producing electricity to meet the rising demand amid the growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars.",
      "The Republican president also granted nearly 70 older coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals.",
      "Trump's government efficiency team, run by Elon Musk, made plans earlier this year to terminate the leases of 34 U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration offices in 19 states.",
      "The coal industry once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production. But it has been in steep decline for decades as operators went out of business and utilities installed more renewable energy and converted coal-fired plants to be fueled by cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.",
      "U.S. coal production was at 1 billion tons (907,000 metric tons) in 2014 and fell to 578 million tons (524 million metric tons) by 2023, the latest year available, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Coal employment nationally peaked in the 1920s when there were about 900,000 miners. It was at about 350,000 in 1950 and has declined steadily since 1980. After the coronavirus pandemic, employment rebounded from 2022 to 2023, rising 4.2% to 45,476. West Virginia employed the most miners at 14,000, followed by Kentucky at 5,000. About half of the nation\u2019s 560 coal mines are located in West Virginia (165) and Kentucky (112). Despite having just 15 mines, Wyoming was the highest-producing coal state due to mechanization and more accessible coal.",
      "Mining fatalities over the past four decades have dropped significantly. There have been 11 or fewer deaths in each of the past five years, according to MSHA.",
      "MSHA is responsible for enforcing U.S. mine safety laws. It is required to inspect each underground mine quarterly and each surface mine twice a year. The cuts proposed by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency would require MSHA inspectors to travel farther to get to a mine, and that could mean less thorough inspections, said Jack Spadaro, a longtime mine safety investigator and environmental specialist who worked for that agency.",
      "According to the DOGE website, ending the MSHA leases is projected to save $18 million. It is unclear whether inspectors\u2019 positions and other jobs from those offices would be moved to other facilities.",
      "Seven of the MSHA offices set for closing are in Kentucky and four are in Pennsylvania. West Virginia is among the states with two targeted offices. Also under consideration for closure are the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement facilities in Lexington, Kentucky, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, shrinking the national footprint of an agency created during the Carter administration to restore land damaged by strip mining, and reclaim abandoned and damaged mine lands.",
      "A recent review of publicly available data by the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center indicates that nearly 17,000 health and safety inspections were conducted from the beginning of 2024 through February 2025 by MSHA staff in the facilities on the chopping block.",
      "Industry advocates have long contended that there are other uses for coal, some of which use cleaner technology.",
      "Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Core Natural Resources is working to develop a process using West Virginia coal to create a synthetic material that can be used as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, reducing U.S. dependence on countries such as China, according to Matthew Mackowiak, the company\u2019s director of government affairs.",
      "Core recently acquired a company that turns coal into carbon foam that produces composite tooling used to make nose cones and plane wings for the U.S. defense industry.",
      "\u201cWhether or not there is any more coal-fired generation in the future, obviously that\u2019s something else to talk about in the future,\u201d Mackowiak said. \u201cBut at the very least, we need to be focused on maintaining our current coal fleet.\u201d",

      "Ava Johnson knows West Virginia coal will not ever be what it once was. But as she makes her way along overgrown railroad tracks near the abandoned Kay Moor mine in the New River Gorge National Park looking for spikes for her collection, the 16-year-old history buff says she has heard people talking with hope about the future of an industry that has brought good-paying jobs to her state for the better part of two centuries.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t appreciate being a true West Virginian unless you realize that people risk their lives every single day to make ours better,\u201d she said.",
      "Much of that renewed sense of hope is based on the actions of President Donald Trump, who earlier this month issued new executive orders aimed at reviving an energy source that has long been flagged by scientists as the world's most polluting fossil fuel, one that directly contributes to the warming of the planet.",
      "Trump, who has pledged since his first run for the presidency in 2016 to \u201csave coal,\u201d issued orders to allow mining on federal land and to loosen some emissions standards meant to curb coal\u2019s environmental impact.",
      "\u201cAll those plants that have been closed are going to be opened, if they're modern enough,\u201d Trump said at the signing ceremony. \u201c(or) they\u2019ll be ripped down and brand-new ones will be built.\u201d",
      "The news was met with enthusiasm in West Virginia, where residents like Johnson say the coal industry is misunderstood and that they are tired of feeling unheard by their fellow Americans. But others do not think Trump will be able to fulfill promises he has made to some of his most loyal constituents.",
      "Trump and his allies are \u201cspinning a false narrative,\" said Tyson Slocum, who teaches energy and climate policy at the University of Maryland Honors College and is the energy program director for the nonprofit Public Citizen. He said market forces have shifted away from coal in ways that cannot be reversed, an opinion widely shared among economists.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that Trump can do that\u2019s going to materially impact the domestic coal market,\u201d Slocum said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe energy markets, the steel markets, have fundamentally changed. And learning how to adapt and how to provide the real solutions to the concerns and fears in coal communities would be a more effective strategy than promising them a return that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d",
      "That was not the prevailing mood at a recent coal exposition in Charleston, attended by Johnson and many others who found encouragement in the Republican president's words, even if some expressed skepticism about his ability to make coal great again.",
      "\u201cFor years, our industry has felt like it\u2019s been a little bit of a whipping boy, like a political, sacrificial pawn,\u201d said Steven Tate of Viacore, a company that makes an apparatus that helps mine operators limit the amount of coal dust in a mine. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re finally starting to get the recognition that our industry deserves.\u201d",
      "Some said Trump's orders demonstrated respect for workers who gave their lives in the mines \u2014 21,000 in West Virginia, the most out of any state \u2014 and for a resource that helped build America.",
      "\u201cTrump stood his ground all the way through,\" said Jimbo Clendenin, a retired mine equipment specialist whose grandson started working in coal mining three years ago. \"He said he was for coal. And a lot of people \u2014 even a couple of them here in West Virginia \u2014 said, \u2019I just think he said that to get into office.\u2032",
      "\"Now, nobody\u2019s got any doubt. He\u2019s for coal.\u201d",
      "In recent decades, the Democratic Party\u2019s aggressive push toward clean energy led to the installation of more renewable energy and the conversion of coal-fired plants to be fueled by cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.",
      "In 2016, Trump seized on the issue, promising to end what he described as Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cwar on coal\u201d and to save miners\u2019 jobs. It helped in West Virginia, where a majority of voters in every county supported Trump in three presidential elections.",
      "Trump did not bring the industry back during his first term. In West Virginia, which employs the most miners of any state, the number of coal jobs fell from 11,561 at the start of his presidency to 11,418 at the end of 2020, perhaps slowing coal\u2019s steep decline but not stopping it.",
      "Slocum said Trump can defang the federal Environmental Protection Agency and deregulate mining, but he cannot save coal.",
      "\u201cIt's not the EPA, it\u2019s not Democrats that declared this war on coal,\u201d Slocum said. \u201cIt was capitalism and natural gas. And being honest about the reasons for coal\u2019s decline is the least we can do for coal-dependent communities instead of lying to them, which the Trump administration is doing. Sometimes people want to believe a lie, because it\u2019s easier than facing a hard truth.\u201d",
      "In 2009, the EPA found that planet-warming greenhouse gases put public health and welfare in danger, a determination that new EPA chief Lee Zeldin has urged Trump to reconsider. Scientists oppose Zeldin\u2019s push, and Slocum said the endangerment finding and the need to move away from coal dependence \u201cis not a theoretical debate. It is a factual, scientific one, albeit one that does not occur within the current Trump administration.\u201d",
      "Still, there is no doubt that the culture of coal is woven into the fabric of West Virginia. A miner can be a coal industry worker, but also a sports team mascot, an image emblazoned on the state flag or the name of a breakfast sandwich at Tudor\u2019s Biscuit World.",
      "In the 1950s, more than 130,000 West Virginians worked in the industry, which then had a population of around 2 million. Production peaked in 2008, a year before Johnson was born. But by then, the number of coal workers had dropped to 25,000, mostly due to mechanization.",
      "Heather Clay, who runs West Virginia Coal Festival\u2019s beauty pageant and social media, said losing coal jobs \u2014 often six-figure incomes \u2014 was especially significant in a state with one of the nation\u2019s highest poverty rates.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so much more than what people outside of West Virginia understand,\u201d she said. \u2019They\u2019re always saying, \u2018Shut down coal,\u2019 \u2018Shut down coal.\u2019 So you want to shut down our economy? You want to shut down our families? You want to shut down our way of life? And it has, for a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Trump and coal industry advocates say keeping coal in the U.S. energy portfolio is essential for maintaining the power grid, servicing growing demand from innovations like artificial intelligence centers and keeping America energy-independent.",
      "But John Deskins, director of the West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research, said it would take a significant shift in the underlying economics for it to make financial sense for utilities to build new coal-fired plants.",
      "Natural gas is cleaner and cheaper, he said, and it\u2019s the direction most utilities are moving in. Earlier this year, First Energy announced plans to convert its two remaining coal-fired power plants to natural gas.",
      "Johnson wears the sash and crown from her pageant victory over a black dress and sneakers as she traipses through the ruins of the abandoned Kay Moor mine. She talks enthusiastically about the industry's past, but also, occasionally, about what she thinks could be a brighter future for coal in West Virginia because of what Trump has done.",
      "\u201cI think that it will positively impact not just the industry,\" she said, \u201cbut people's lives.\u201d",

      "As President Donald Trump's trade war has injected turmoil in financial markets, many retired and near-retired Americans are anxiously looking on, worried about outliving their savings or having to put off entries on their bucket lists",
      "NEW YORK -- Michael Montgomery used to check the balance on his retirement account once a week and smile. But lately, not wanting to get upset and question if he could retire in a few years, there was only one solution.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking,\u201d says the 66-year-old professor from Huntington Woods, Michigan.",
      "As the White House simultaneously injects turmoil into financial markets with its trade war and dismisses fears of a downturn, retired and near-retired Americans are anxiously looking on, worried about outliving their savings or having to put off entries on their bucket lists.",
      "Keeping logged off his account has made Montgomery\u2019s days less worrisome. He and his wife adjusted their portfolio after Election Day, including moving more money into bonds. But he\u2019s not sure what more he can do if the entire world economy can be affected by Washington\u2019s decisions.",
      "\u201cI hope like hell I don\u2019t lose all my retirement savings,\u201d he says. \u201cBut where else could you put the money that these people could not disorder? They can\u2019t get into your mattress but that\u2019s about it.\u201d",
      "Many experts warned U.S. stocks were overpriced and due for a correction even before President Donald Trump reclaimed the Oval Office. But a historic blanket of tariffs have injected new uncertainty into the market.",
      "Though stocks rallied this week, the S&P 500 is down 10% from an all-time high reached in February. Losses in the Nasdaq and among small-cap stocks are steeper. Even bonds and the U.S. dollar have been volatile. Many economists are warning of a possible recession.",
      "It has 71-year-old Jeanne Oats Estridge feeling so \u201cparanoid\u201d she called her financial planner with an idea.",
      "\u201cHow about we put it all in cash?\u201d Oats Estridge asked.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t advise it,\u201d she heard back.",
      "Oats Estridge, who lives in Dayton, Ohio, retired from a job in software engineering and now writes books, including her latest, on four octogenarian women kidnapped by sex-trafficking aliens. Her account is down more than $40,000 and she gets angry thinking about how some in Washington have reacted to the market volatility, including Trump\u2019s recent market assessment that it was \u201ca great time to buy.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere am I supposed to come up with the money to buy? My underwear drawer?\u201d Oats Estridge asks.",
      "Earlier this month, the Cboe Volatility Index, considered a \u201cfear gauge\u201d of investor pessimism, reached its highest level in five years. The index, known as VIX, has since retreated but is still in territory reflecting fearful investors. Another measure of market sentiment, the Cboe S&P 500 Left Tail Volatility Index, which tracks investor worry about so-called \u201cblack swan\u201d events such as the 2008 housing crash that spurred the Great Recession, likewise has backed off from highs but remains elevated.",
      "Trump has urged people to \u201cbe cool\u201d in assessing the impact of tariffs on their investments. Asked about his own savings earlier this month, he chuckled and replied: \u201cI haven\u2019t checked my 401(k).\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, meantime, brushed off the possibility that some might need to delay retiring, saying people \u201cdon\u2019t look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what\u2019s happening.\u201d",
      "That seeming nonchalance isn\u2019t sitting well with some older investors.",
      "Peter Rost, 72, retired from his software development job last year and planned to start tapping his retirement savings to supplement Social Security. But he doesn\u2019t want to bake in his losses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking to take $2,000 and meanwhile the account drops by $30,000,\u201d he says.",
      "He\u2019s been through serious downturns before, but those were different.",
      "\u201cI had the time to be patient and let it work its way back,\u201d says Rost, who lives in New Hartford, Connecticut, \u201cbut now I\u2019m retired and I need money from that account.\u201d",
      "At his age, he says, there\u2019s one goal: \u201cMake sure I don\u2019t run out of money before I die.\u201d",
      "Americans\u2019 retirement savings totaled about $44 trillion at the end of 2024, according to the Investment Company Institute. The composition of those savings has shifted increasingly toward stocks in the last couple decades as the 401(k) has become employers\u2019 typical offering.",
      "Among fund giant Vanguard\u2019s nearly 5 million accounts, for example, the average investor puts three-quarters of their savings in stocks. Even older investors are still heavily steeped in equities: People 55 to 64 have 64% in stocks at Vanguard; those 65 and older have 49% in stocks.",
      "With that exposure, financial advisers are getting an influx of calls amid the recent market uncertainty.",
      "Tj Binkowski, who runs Narrow Road Financial Planning in Clarksville, Tennessee, says some clients find themselves obsessively checking their accounts and feel the emotional strain of worrying about their money. A downturn, he says, hits an older investor much differently.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re retired, paper losses aren\u2019t just on paper anymore,\u201d says Binkowski. \u201cYou\u2019re locking them in every month that you take money out.\u201d",
      "Paul Duesterhaus, a 68-year-old retiree from Quincy, Illinois, is passing up an IRA withdrawal this year to avoid selling at a low. Instead, the retired manager at an air compressor manufacturing company will put off buying a new car as planned and cut back on things like eating out.",
      "Still, he can\u2019t help but feel bigger impacts of a trade war are ahead.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s going to be longer lasting effects that are going to affect every American,\u201d he says.",
      "That angst is more common among older adults than younger people. An April poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found just under half of U.S. adults ages 45 and older said their retirement savings are a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress for them right now, compared to about one-third of younger people. Older Americans were also more likely to say they're stressed about the stock market.",
      "For now, many older investors are taking the advice of many experts, to fine-tune investments if necessary but avoid dramatic moves. But it can be hard advice to swallow.",
      "\u201cThe more things go up and down, the more nervous you get,\u201d says Steve Turner, a 74-year-old from Chesterfield, Missouri, who runs a small public relations business. He now finds himself anxious when he goes to log on to his retirement account, wondering, \u201cGee, do I want to press the button?\u201d",
      "\u201cYou worry that things may work themselves out in the long run, but you don\u2019t have as long,\" says Turner. \"You\u2019re not 30, you\u2019re not 40, you\u2019re not 50, you\u2019re not even 60.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s main liberal opposition party has tapped its former leader Lee Jae-myung as presidential candidate in the June 3 vote",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Lee Jae-myung, a liberal who wants greater economic parity in South Korea and warmer ties with North Korea, became the main opposition party's presidential candidate Sunday, solidifying his position as front-runner to succeed recently ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "The former Democratic Party chief had led the opposition-controlled parliament\u2019s impeachment of Yoon over the imposition of martial law in December. The country's Constitutional Court formally dismissed Yoon earlier this month, prompting an early presidential election on June 3 to find a new president.",
      "In a nationally televised announcement, the Democratic Party announced that Lee won its presidential nomination with nearly 90% of the votes cast during the primary that ended Sunday, defeating two competitors.",
      "\"Now, the people and our party colleagues gave me an opportunity to win back the presidency and build a new, real Republic of Korea. Thank you! I\u2019ll humbly uphold that ardent, serious task,\u201d Lee said in a victory speech.",
      "Lee, 60, who served as the governor of South Korea\u2019s most populous Gyeonggi province and a mayor of Seongnam city, is the clear favorite to win the election.",
      "In a Gallup Korea poll released on Friday, 38% of respondents chose Lee as their preferred choice, while all other aspirants obtained single-digit ratings. The main conservative People Power Party will nominate its candidate next weekend. Its four presidential hopefuls competing to win the party ticket won a combined 23% of support ratings in the Gallup survey.",
      "It will be Lee's third bid to run for president. He lost the 2022 election to Yoon in the narrowest margin in the country\u2019s presidential elections. In 2017, Lee ranked third in a Democratic Party primary.",
      "Lee has long established an image as an anti-establishment figure who can eliminate deep-rooted inequality and corruption in South Korea. But his critics view him as a populist who relies on stoking divisions and demonizing opponents and worry his rule would likely further polarize the country.",
      "Lee currently faces five trials for corruption and other criminal charges. If he becomes president, those trials will likely stop as he will enjoy special presidential immunity from most criminal charges.",
      "Lee's rise comes as conservatives are struggling to win back public confidence in the wake of Yoon's martial law decree that plunged the country into turmoil. The People Power Party is grappling with internal feuding between senior members defending Yoon\u2019s action and reformist members who voted for his impeachment.",
      "\u201cThis election is a venue where the people hand down their judgment on Yoon\u2019s martial law imposition after the Constitutional Court issued a judicial judgment on it,\u201d said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s subsequently difficult for the People Power Party to win the election if they slide over the martial law issue and fail to apologize.\u201d",
      "When Yoon declared martial law and sent troops to the National Assembly, Lee livestreamed as he went to the assembly and urged people to gather there to protect lawmakers from possible arrests. Lee and others managed to enter an assembly hall to vote down Yoon's decree, forcing him to lift it.",
      "Lee has recently made few comments that could be portrayed as too radical and has focused on ways to revive the economy, ease economic polarization and overcome a national divide.",
      "\u201cRestoring democracy is the path to national unity. Reviving economic growth is the path to national unity. Narrowing the gaps between us is the path to national unity,\u201d Lee said during Sunday's speech.",
      "On foreign policy, Lee has underscored the importance of a trilateral South Korea-U.S.-Japan security partnership. But he's also called for healing badly frayed ties with North Korea, saying peace can drive South Korea's economic growth.",
      "In a recent online talk show, Lee said that he thinks the U.S. would pursue better ties with North Korea as a way to contain China and that such a stance would provide South Korea with diplomatic room to restore ties with the North.",

      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Iowa's governor on Friday sued the Des Moines Register over the newspaper's open records request, asking the court to validate her office's withholding of certain emails she claims are protected.",
      "A Register reporter submitted a records request in February to Gov. Kim Reynolds' office, according to the complaint. In response, the Republican governor's office provided 825 pages of relevant documents and withheld four emails, asserting they were protected because they were \u201cintended to be confidential, and disclosure would inhibit the governor's ability to receive candid, fulsome, and robust information in the future,\" according to the office's response included in filings.",
      "An attorney followed up on the Register's behalf last week, according to court filings, arguing that so-called executive privilege is not an exemption in Iowa's open records law and, even if it was, there was no indication the governor sent or received the emails. The attorney, Susan P. Elgin, called the withholding \u201clegally indefensible\u201d and asked the records be produced in a week's time.",
      "Instead, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird sued Friday to ask the court to intervene, as Iowa law allows, and force the Register to halt its pursuit of the records. The Associated Press emailed Elgin Friday requesting comment. The Register's parent company, Gannett Co., said in an email it does not comment on pending litigation.",
      "In a statement, the governor's office said it was unfortunate that public resources would be used to defend the governor's withholding of the records.",
      "\u201cIt is in the public\u2019s interest that governors can receive candid advice from their closest advisors,\u201d said spokesperson Mason Mauro.",
      "In 2023, the Iowa Supreme Court rejected Reynolds\u2019 request that the court throw out a records-related lawsuit filed against her by the liberal-leaning Bleeding Heartland blog, Iowa Capital Dispatch and Iowa Freedom of Information Council, a nonprofit that focuses on open government issues. The organizations and some of their reporters sued accusing Reynolds of violating the state\u2019s open records law by ignoring records requests and not producing records in a timely manner.",
      "The Register, along with the newspaper's parent company and their former pollster, also is named in a suit filed by President Donald Trump, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and former Iowa state Sen. Brad Zaun.",

      "GENEVA -- The Swiss president says Switzerland is among 15 countries with which the United States plans to conduct \u201cprivileged\u201d negotiations to help reach a deal in the wake of sweeping U.S. tariffs on dozens of countries that have shaken global markets.",
      "Karin Keller-Sutter, in an interview with broadcaster SRF published Friday, said she was \u201csatisfied\u201d with talks in Washington this week that included an International Monetary Fund conference and her one-on-one meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Keller-Sutter also serves as Switzerland\u2019s finance minister.",
      "\u201cThe United States has defined a group of 15 countries with which it wants to find ... a quick solution in this tariff question. Switzerland is part of this group of these 15 countries,\u201d she told reporters separately late Thursday in Washington.",
      "It was not immediately clear which 14 other countries were included, but she told SRF that \u201cthe U.S. envisages conducting \u2014 I would say somewhat privileged \u2014 negotiations and finding solutions\u201d with that group.",
      "Before the Trump administration paused some of its most stringent tariff plans, products imported from Switzerland had been set to face tariffs of 31% \u2014 more than the 20% tariffs on goods from the European Union. Switzerland is not a member of the 27-country bloc.",
      "According to figures published by the Swiss Embassy in Washington, the U.S. has been Switzerland\u2019s most important goods export market worldwide since 2021, while Switzerland is the fourth most important export market for U.S. services. The bilateral trade volume in goods and services between Switzerland and the U.S. reached a total of $185.9 billion in 2023, the embassy says on its website.",
      "Keller-Sutter said a memorandum of understanding was to be drawn up after which negotiations can begin. A document would also lay out the most important topics, and \u201cwe have also been assigned a specific contact person. This is not easy in the U.S. administration,\u201d she was quoted as saying.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. authorities have clearly expressed their desire to find a solution with Switzerland,\u201d Keller-Sutter told SRF. She said no timetable had been set, but the two sides agreed to move forward quickly \u201cbecause uncertainty is poison for the economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on April 2 set off turmoil in world stock markets. A week later, Trump spoke by phone with Keller-Sutter in a conversation that her office said focused on tariffs. She emphasized the \u201cimportant role of Swiss companies and investments\" in the U.S.",
      "Hours later, Trump announced the U-turn that paused the steep new tariffs on about 60 countries for 90 days, fanning speculation \u2014 which was not confirmed \u2014 in some Swiss media that her chat with Trump might have played a role in the change of course.",
      "On Thursday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, during a trip to Beijing, said the U.S. tariffs have thrust the affected countries into \u201ca sort of coalition\u201d to try to reach a deal with the United States. And on Monday, Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche announced plans to invest $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years \u2014 an unspecified amount of which has already been under way.",

      "Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in has called his bribery indictment \u201cunjust\u201d and accused prosecutors of abusing their power in what he called a politically motivated investigation",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Former South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday called his indictment on bribery charges \u201cunjust,\u201d accusing prosecutors of abusing their power in what he called a politically motivated investigation.",
      "Moon\u2019s comments came a day after prosecutors in the southern city of Jeonju announced his indictment over allegations that a budget airline gave his son-in-law a lucrative no-show job during his presidency.",
      "Meeting with National Assembly speaker Woo Won-shik, Moon said he feels that prosecutors are \u201cpushing forward in a predetermined direction, no matter what\u201d and that his case was an example of \u201chow politicized the prosecution has become and how prosecutorial power is being abused.\u201d The former liberal leader was visiting the National Assembly for an event marking the seventh anniversary of his 2018 summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, held during a brief period of engagement between the rival Koreas.",
      "Moon\u2019s indictment adds to a long list of South Korean leaders who have faced criminal allegations or scandals near the end of their terms or after leaving office. On June 3 South Korea will hold a presidential election to select a successor to conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was recently removed from office over an ill-conceived imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Yoon, who previously served as prosecutor general under the Moon administration before a high-profile fallout with the liberal leadership, is now facing a criminal trial on rebellion charges related to the decree.",
      "Moon\u2019s political allies at the main opposition Democratic Party have portrayed the indictment as a political vendetta, pushed by Yoon\u2019s supporters at the prosecution service to humiliate the former liberal leader ahead of the election.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Moon, who served as president from 2017-2022, received bribes totaling 217 million won ($151,000) from Lee Sang-jik, founder of the budget carrier Thai Eastar Jet. The bribes were allegedly in the form of financial support for Moon\u2019s son-in-law between 2018-2020.",
      "Prosecutors say the man, who reportedly divorced Moon\u2019s daughter in 2021, was hired by Lee\u2019s company in Thailand despite having no experience in the airline industry, and performed minimal duties while claiming to work remotely from South Korea.",
      "Prosecutors said they had not found evidence that Moon directly arranged political favors for Lee, but that Lee, who worked on Moon\u2019s campaign, likely expected his assistance to be repaid. Lee was later named the head of the state-funded Korea Small and Medium Enterprises and Startups Agency and was nominated by Moon\u2019s party to run for parliament while Moon was in office.",

      "George Kittle agreed to a four-year contract extension with the San Francisco 49ers that will make him the highest-paid tight end in NFL history",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- George Kittle agreed to a four-year contract extension with the San Francisco 49ers that will make him the highest-paid tight end in NFL history.",
      "Kittle announced the deal on the \u201cBussin' With The Boys\u201d podcast on Tuesday, saying the extension was worth $76.4 million over four years with $35 million guaranteed at signing. The deal keeps Kittle under contract with San Francisco through the 2029 season.",
      "The 49ers confirmed the deal with the only remaining member of the original draft class under coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch.",
      "\u201cIn 2017, our first year with the 49ers, we selected a skinny tight end from Iowa whom we were really excited about. We had high hopes, but no one knew that he would become the player that he is today,\u201d Lynch said in a statement. \u201cGeorge\u2019s leadership, enthusiasm for the game, for his teammates, and the faithful are truly unique and special. He is an outstanding representation for the 49ers on the field and is an outstanding representative for the organization off the field with his investment in the local and military communities. He has a great sense of pride in his role and has put in the work to be one of the best tight ends in the NFL.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old Kittle was entering the final year of a five-year, $75 million extension that he signed in 2020. Kittle didn't show up for the first few days of the team's voluntary offseason program last week but arrived later in the week in a sign that a deal could get done soon.",
      "The $19.1 million average annual value of the extension tops the previous record for a tight end of $19 million set earlier this offseason when Trey McBride signed an extension with Arizona. The $35 million guaranteed to Kittle at the signing of the deal is also the most for any tight end.",
      "After having several recent contract negotiations run deep into the summer, causing players like Deebo Samuel, Nick Bosa, Brandon Aiyuk and Trent Williams to miss at least some time in training camp, the Niners got this deal done with Kittle quickly.",
      "They still have one more big contract extension to finalize this offseason: They are in talks with quarterback Brock Purdy about a deal that is expected to pay him more than $50 million a year.",
      "Kittle has been one of the best all-around tight ends since entering the league; he thrives as a receiver, a blocker and is one of the best at making big plays after the catch.",
      "Kittle has been a first or second-team All-Pro five times in eight seasons and has made six Pro Bowls. His four seasons with at least 1,000 yards receiving ranks tied for the second most of all time for a tight end, trailing only the seven for Kansas City's Travis Kelce.",
      "Kittle was a second-team All-Pro last season when he had 78 catches for 1,106 yards and eight TDs. Since being drafted in the fifth round in 2017, Kittle has had 538 catches for 7,380 yards and 45 TDs. He has the second-most yards ever for a tight end through eight seasons.",

      "British prosecutors says a man arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of ice hockey player Adam Johnson has been told he will not face any charges",
      "LONDON -- A man arrested on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of ice hockey player Adam Johnson has been told he will not face any charges, British prosecutors said Tuesday.",
      "Johnson played for the Nottingham Panthers and died shortly after his neck had been sliced in a collision with Sheffield Steelers defenseman Matt Petgrave during a game on Oct. 28, 2023.",
      "A man was arrested two weeks later and though South Yorkshire Police has not publicly identified him, Petgrave himself said in a crowdfunding appeal for legal fees that he\u2019s the subject of a police investigation.",
      "On Tuesday, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided it would not bring criminal charges against the man arrested following what it described as \u201ca shocking and deeply upsetting incident.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe CPS and South Yorkshire Police have worked closely together to determine whether any criminal charges should be brought against the other ice hockey player involved,\" Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Michael Quinn said.",
      "\u201cFollowing a thorough police investigation and a comprehensive review of all the evidence by the CPS, we have concluded that there is not a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offence and so there will not be a prosecution. Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Adam Johnson.\u201d",
      "After his arrest, Petgrave had been re-bailed several times while the investigation took place.",
      "Johnson had skated with the puck into Sheffield\u2019s defensive zone when Petgrave collided with another Panthers player nearby. Petgrave\u2019s left skate elevated as he began to fall and the blade hit Johnson in the neck.",
      "The native of Hibbing, Minnesota, was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. The death of the 29-year-old former Pittsburgh Penguins player sparked debate across the sport about improving safety for players.",
      "Petgrave, a 32-year-old Canadian, had support from some of Johnson\u2019s teammates. Victor Bj\u00f6rkung had told a Swedish newspaper there \u201cisn\u2019t a chance that it\u2019s deliberate.\u201d Bj\u00f6rkung had played the pass to Johnson and said he was traumatized by what he saw. He left the team as a result.",
      "Johnson was in his first season at Nottingham \u2014 one of the \u201cimport\u201d players in the Elite Ice Hockey League \u2014 after stints in Germany and a handful of games for the Penguins in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons.",
      "Johnson was living with fianc\u00e9e Ryan Wolfe and studying at Loughborough Business School.",
      "The English Ice Hockey Association, which governs the sport below the Elite League, reacted to Johnson\u2019s death by requiring all players in England to wear neck guards from the start of 2024.",

      "The precocious batter seemed destined for stardom when he went to Rajasthan Royals during the IPL auction last year at the age of 13. He hit a six with the first ball he faced in the tournament. It took Suryavanshi just three games in the sport\u2019s richest, ritziest league to grab global attention as he smashed 11 sixes and seven fours in his breathtaking 101.",
      "Now he\u2019s the real thing. He plundered all those boundaries against an experienced Gujarat Titans bowling attack with a combined 694 games of international experience.",

      "Rajasthan, which won the inaugural edition of IPL in 2008, has a history of nurturing cricketing talent. Suryavanshi was born a year after Yousuf Pathan hit the then fastest century in IPL in 2010 off 37 balls for Rajasthan against Mumbai Indians.",
      "Pathan was quick to congratulate the youngster for breaking his record for fastest IPL hundred by an Indian.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to fall down three when we give up those first two. A couple of strange goals for sure,\u201d Avs coach Jared Bednar said. \u201cWe definitely needed to get sharper on the defensive side early in the game, but we pushed back and created some good chances at the other end.\u201d",
      "Rantanen made it 3-0 early in the second period on a break with fellow Finnish player Roope Hintz, who after initially getting the puck sent it back with a cross-ice pass to set up Rantanen's short snap shot for his 35th career playoff goal.",
      "Hintz added an empty-net goal with 2:05 left, on an assist from Rantanen.",
      "Colorado traded Rantanen on Jan. 24 to Carolina in the East, where he played only 13 games. A deadline deal March 7 sent him back to the Central Division with the Stars and included a $96 million, eight-year contract extension.",

      "Saints quarterback Derek Carr has stated publicly for the first time that he has a shoulder injury",
      "METAIRIE, La. -- Saints quarterback Derek Carr stated publicly for the first time that he has a shoulder injury, but stopped short of disclosing any specifics about how or when it happened, or how it might affect his availability to play during the coming season.",
      "\u201cI hate that I have to say this, but I have to say this: Yes, I have a shoulder injury,\u201d Carr said while delivering a guest sermon at a church in Las Vegas on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI have an MRI report to prove it,\u201d Carr continued. \"The team knows about it. We\u2019ve been in constant communication. There\u2019s nothing wrong. We\u2019re figuring it out and we\u2019re going to go forward with that. Is that OK?\"",
      "\u201cI've been dealing with people lying about me ... and I'm like, \u2018Lord, why do I have to continue to deal with this nonsense?\u201d Carr continued. \"You never know what someone's really going through. And so why do we continually try to attack people \u2014 and I would say attack people that are maybe trying to do things the right way?\"",
      "Carr's sermon took place two days after the Saints used their second-round pick \u2014 the 40th overall \u2014 in this year's NFL draft, to select Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough.",
      "The Saints picked Shough two days after the club's general manager, Mickey Loomis, acknowledged publicly that Carr has \u201can issue\u201d with his shoulder about which the Saints are seeking more \u201cclarity.\u201d",
      "The issue first arose when NFL.com, citing an anonymous source, reported on April 11 that Carr might need shoulder surgery which could cause him to miss part or all of the upcoming season.",
      "The report did not state which shoulder Carr injured or how he injured it. Carr\u2019s agent, Timothy Younger, did not return multiple messages from The Associated Press about the matter. And until Wednesday, the Saints had not addressed it, either.",
      "Likewise, Loomis has declined to say when he first learned of the injury or explain his understanding of how it happened.",
      "Car, who is 14-13 in two seasons as a Saints starter, injured the AC joint in his throwing shoulder in 2023, but never missed a game because of it. Carr missed seven games in 2024, but because of oblique and hand injuries.",
      "The Saints\u2019 injury reports last season did not mention any issues with Carr\u2019s shoulder, and when he played, he had multiple downfield completions that went for 50 or more yards.",
      "But as Carr entered the third year of his four-year Saints contract, doubt surrounded his long-term future with the club because of a coaching change, his inconsistent play and apparent fan discontent.",
      "Carr was signed during the tenure of previous coach Dennis Allen, who was fired last season. The new coach is former Philadelphia offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, who is installing a new offense.",

So good for him, does a great job of getting up the ice and timing when to go in and to take that chance. So he's an important part of what we do.\u201d",
      "Hagel did not return after the hit from Ekblad, which happened before Tampa Bay's goals. Hagel was back from a one game suspension after his late hit knocked Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov out of Game 2.",
      "The play on Monday reflected the chippy nature of the series, which has had a somewhat controversial hit in three straight games. After Hagel\u2019s hit in Game 2, Florida\u2019s Matthew Tkachuk landed a late hit on Jake Guentzel in Game 3 and was assessed a five-minute major, though he was not suspended.",
      "Florida\u2019s Niko Mikkola was hit with a five-minute major and a game misconduct early in the third period Monday for boarding Zemgus Girgensons, who was on his knees.",

      "\u201cThere's the mechanics piece of it, there's the uncomfortable, not feeling right,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAs Tyler said, very frustrating, and we're all just trying to get to the bottom of it.\u201d",
      "For the second consecutive season, Glasnow has joined an alarmingly long list of Dodgers pitchers with significant injury problems.",
      "Top-line starters Glasnow, Blake Snell (left shoulder inflammation) and Clayton Kershaw (recovery from toe and knee surgery) are on the injured list, along with Blake Treinen (right forearm tightness), Michael Kopech (right shoulder), Brusdar Graterol (right shoulder surgery) and several other relievers.",
      "\u201cPitching is certainly volatile,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe experienced it last year \u2014 I think every year. I think the thing that's probably most disconcerting is leading Major League Baseball in bullpen innings. I think that that's something the starters are built up to take those innings down, so that's sort of where my head is at, to make sure we don't red-line these guys.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-8 Glasnow has a lengthy injury history, but the Dodgers still signed him to a five-year, $136.5 million contract after acquiring the LA-area native from Tampa Bay in December 2023. Glasnow was solid to begin his debut season with the Dodgers, going 9-6 with a 3.49 ERA and a 0.95 WHIP \u2014 but he didn't pitch after Aug. 11, developing elbow tendinitis that kept him out of the postseason.",
      "Glasnow altered his delivery and his between-starts routine in an attempt to stay healthier, but he only got through five starts and 18 innings this season before his latest injury woes, going 1-0 with a 4.50 ERA.",
      "Snell, who got a $182 million free-agent deal from deep-pocketed Los Angeles last November, made only two starts for his new team before going on the shelf this month.",
      "The Dodgers used 17 starting pitchers during the 2024 regular season while their rotation was altered almost weekly by major injuries. Los Angeles won the World Series while relying on an October starting rotation of late-season acquisition Jack Flaherty, Yoshinobu Yamamoto (who missed three months of the regular season) and Walker Buehler (who also missed three months) along with multiple bullpen games.",
      "Flaherty and Buehler departed in free agency when the Dodgers declined to re-sign them. Gavin Stone, who led LA with 25 starts last season, is out for the entire 2025 season after right shoulder surgery.",
      "The Dodgers' high-priced starting rotation is thin yet again in 2025: LA will have to throw a bullpen game Tuesday against the Miami Marlins, while former All-Star right-hander Tony Gonsolin will return to the mound Wednesday to make his first start since August 2023 after recovering from Tommy John surgery.",
      "Gonsolin's return is part of the good news for the Dodgers' staff.",
      "Dustin May, Monday's starter, is also back in the rotation after missing two years with injuries, while Yamamoto and newcomer Roki Sasaki have remained healthy this month.",
      "And two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani is expected to make his Dodgers debut on the mound in the first half of this season, although the team hasn't set a timeline.",
      "Roberts isn't sure how he will fill out his rotation when the Dodgers begin a road trip with 10 games in 10 days on Friday in Atlanta. The Dodgers might stretch out reliever Ben Casparius, a longtime starting pitcher before he reached the majors.",
      "The Dodgers recalled right-handed reliever Noah Davis to fill Glasnow's roster spot.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- Damian Lillard has a torn left Achilles tendon, confirming the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 worst fears after the seven-time all-NBA guard was helped off the court Sunday night.",
      "The Bucks announced the severity of Lillard's injury after he had an MRI on Monday.",
      "The injury knocks Lillard out for the rest of the postseason and could put his status for next season in doubt as well. When Kevin Durant tore his Achilles tendon in the 2019 NBA Finals, he ended up missing the entire 2019-20 season.",
      "The Bucks had been bracing for this outcome after Milwaukee\u2019s 129-103 loss to the Indiana Pacers in Game 4. Milwaukee trails the Indiana Pacers 3-1 in their Eastern Conference first-round series. Game 5 is Tuesday at Indianapolis.",
      "Lillard\u2019s injury occurred in his third game since coming back from deep vein thrombosis in his right calf.",
      "\u201cThis is a tough one, honestly,\u201d Bucks coach Doc Rivers said after Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cBlood clot, followed by this. It\u2019s just tough. That\u2019s why you have teammates and family around him. He\u2019s just such a great freaking dude, on a basketball level, but more importantly as a teammate and a father and all that stuff.\u201d",
      "Lillard, 34, was behind the 3-point line around the top of the key midway through the first quarter when the ball bounced toward him. Lillard used his left hand to tip the ball toward teammate Gary Trent Jr., then went down and grabbed the lower part of his left leg. He continued to sit on the floor as play resumed on the other end of the court.",
      "When Lillard got up, he couldn\u2019t put weight on his left leg. He eventually was helped off the court and into the locker room.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the toughest guys I know, so when he stays down, you feel for him,\u201d said teammate Pat Connaughton, who played with Lillard in Portland and Milwaukee.",
      "Lillard's toughness had been apparent from the fact that he was playing in the first place after missing the Bucks\u2019 final 14 regular-season games with deep vein thrombosis, an abnormal clot within a vessel where the congealing of blood blocks the flow through on the way back to the heart.",
      "He was taken off blood-thinning medication and cleared to resume full basketball activity after the regular season. He missed Game 1 of the Pacers series to work his way back and then returned in Game 2.",
      "\u201cI have so much respect for him,\u201d teammate and two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo said. \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t see what Dame had to deal with, but we\u2019re around him every single day, and it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard being in his position. He\u2019s one of the toughest, mentally toughest guys I\u2019ve ever been around. That\u2019s why he is who he is.\u201d",
      "Lillard ranked 10th in the NBA in scoring (24.9) and 10th in assists (7.1) this season while earning his 10th All-Star Game selection. He made an extraordinarily rapid return from his deep vein thrombosis to rejoin his teammates for the playoffs.",
      "While talking to reporters before the playoffs, Lillard said doctors had told him his case was unusual.",
      "\u201cThey were just like, \u2018We don\u2019t see this,\u2019\" Lillard said then. \u201cFor me, I was just like, it was a different experience for me because I went in there a bunch of times and it was the same size. So I\u2019m like, it didn\u2019t seem that special, and then it just reached a point where it just got a lot smaller out of nowhere.\u201d",
      "Now he faces an even longer recovery while dealing with a separate issue requiring surgery.",
      "\u201cI believe he\u2019s going to overcome every obstacle that\u2019s put in front of him,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s going to be there for him. No matter what the obstacle is for him, he\u2019s going to overcome and we\u2019re going to help him overcome it.\u201d",
      "Lillard's situation continues the Bucks' run of bad luck with postseason injuries since winning their 2021 title.",
      "Khris Middleton missed an entire seven-game Eastern Conference semifinal loss to Boston in 2022 with a sprained medial collateral ligament. Antetokounmpo bruised his lower back in Milwaukee\u2019s first playoff game in 2023 and didn\u2019t return until Game 4 of a first-round series it lost 4-1 to Miami. In the Bucks\u2019 4-2 first-round loss to Indiana last year, Antetokounmpo didn\u2019t play at all because of a calf strain, and Lillard missed two games with an Achilles injury.",

      "Rajasthan made 212-2, winning for only the third time in 10 games to stay in playoffs contention.",
      "Suryavanshi rose to fame when he was drafted at age 13 last November. In a splashy debut this month, he whacked the first ball he faced for six at the same venue.",

      "Suryavanshi was patted on the back by his partner Jaiswal as he celebrated, removed his helmet and raised his bat to acknowledge the applause of the home crowd. He also saluted his teammates in the dugout with his bat.",
      "Only West Indies great Chris Gayle has hit an IPL hundred in less balls, 30, and that was 12 years ago.",
      "Fast bowler Prasidh Krishna finally clean-bowled Suryavanshi, who left to another standing ovation and to hugs from teammates.",
      "Left-handers Suryavanshi and Jaiswal raised Rajasthan's highest stand for any wicket in the IPL, and the teenager eclipsed Sanju Samson's record of 10 sixes in an IPL innings for an Indian batter.",

      "Curry has spent his entire 16-year career with the Golden State Warriors, helping them win four championships, and is one of the league's most popular players.",
      "He received 66 first-place votes and 1,257 total points to beat out Houston veteran center Steven Adams, who appeared on more ballots and finished with 46 first-place votes and 1,237 points. Jalen Brunson, the New York Knicks captain who won the Clutch Player of the Year award, finished third.",
      "A panel of league executives chose 12 finalists for the award and current players voted from the list.",
      "The award, presented since 2013, is named for Jack Twyman and Maurice Stokes, who were teammates on the Rochester/Cincinnati Royals from 1955-58.",
      "Stokes suffered a brain injury in the final game of the 1957-58 regular season, fell into a coma days later and became permanently paralyzed. Twyman became Stokes' legal guardian and advocate, and supported him for the rest of his life.",

      "NEW YORK -- Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese's return to college for WNBA preseason games will be two of a record four exhibition games shown on national TV.",
      "Clark will head back to Iowa for an exhibition between her Indiana Fever and the Brazilian national team on Sunday, a game airing on ESPN. The Fever's exhibition game against the Washington Mystics a day earlier will be on NBA TV.",
      "Reese will lead the Chicago Sky back to her alma mater, LSU, on Friday to face the Brazilian team. Sky teammate Kamilla Cardoso played for that Brazilian team in February 2024, trying to help it qualify for the Paris Olympics. That game will be part of a doubleheader on ION.",
      "The WNBA will be showing all 15 of its preseason games either on national television or league pass.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the demand for WNBA content grow exponentially and we are meeting that demand by working with our broadcast partners and our teams to make a significant investment by making all 15 preseason games available to WNBA fans,\u201d Chief Growth Officer Colie Edison said.",
      "The league showed two exhibition games in 2023 and four last year, including Clark's debut, which was on league pass. Reese's preseason debut against Minnesota wasn't televised, but a fan livestreamed it on social media. The livestream drew significant attention, getting millions of views.",
      "The two rookies last season helped the league draw record-breaking viewership. ESPN games averaged 1.2 million viewers in the regular season, a 170% increase from the previous year. The postseason averaged 1.1 million viewers, making it the league's most-viewed playoffs in 25 years.",
      "The other game that will be nationally televised will be when Dallas plays Las Vegas at Notre Dame in the first game of the ION doubleheader Friday. Three former Irish stars \u2014 Dallas' Arike Ogunbowale and Las Vegas' Jewell Loyd and Jackie Young \u2014 are coming back to campus.

    "summary": "It&rsquo;s not often that the 144th overall pick is the biggest story of the NFL draft",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s not often that the 144th overall pick is the biggest story of the NFL draft",
      "It's not often that the 144th overall pick is the biggest story of the NFL draft.",
      "But Shedeur Sanders was not the usual 144th pick and his situation transcended football. The narrative around Sanders blurred lines between sports, race and culture.",
      "The former University of Colorado quarterback was the center of a three-day spectacle of cringe that will live in football lore for a long time. Sanders fell from a potential top-five overall selection on Thursday to the fifth round on Saturday in an excruciating slide that had his supporters fuming and detractors laughing.",
      "The Cleveland Browns finally ended Sanders' misery with the No. 144 selection, adding the 23-year-old to a crowded quarterback room that includes Joe Flacco, Kenny Pickett, fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel and the injured Deshaun Watson.",
      "Five quarterbacks were selected in this year's draft before Sanders, including Gabriel and No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward, who went to the Tennessee Titans.",
      "Sanders \u2014 the son of Pro Football Hall of Famer and Colorado coach Deion Sanders \u2014 has been among the biggest stories in college football over the past four years, first at Jackson State and then with the Buffaloes. The quarterback's play on the field, and occasionally brash personality on and off it, have made him one of the sport's lightning rods.",
      "Below, The Associated Press examines some of the potential reasons for Sanders' free fall, using the QB's own words, his father's comments, the analysis of pundits and his on-the-field performance.",
      "WHAT THE SANDERS SAID: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to understand, when that last name is on your back, you\u2019re going to be attacked and ridiculed by naysayers,\u201d Colorado coach Deion Sanders said.",
      "From Shedeur Sanders: \u201cI\u2019m going to just be myself so you either like it or you don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "WHAT OTHERS SAID: The younger Sanders carries himself with supreme confidence \u2014 much like his father did when he was a two-sport start in the NFL and Major League Baseball in the 1990s. But some pundits who cover the league (usually using anonymous sources) said Sanders\u2019 confidence could annoy NFL personnel, particularly during the interview process at the league\u2019s combine. The elder Sanders was occasionally outspoken on social media about his son\u2019s talent, taking on critics.",
      "\u201cAll of these things began to add up for teams, and I\u2019m not saying that is right that it added up for teams, but it did, clearly, add up for teams. ... This is clearly a way for the NFL and its teams to let him and anyone else after him know \u2014 you can\u2019t comport yourself in this way moving forward,\u201d said Jonathan Jones, an NFL analyst for CBS.",
      "WHAT SANDERS DID: The younger Sanders might be brash \u2014 he set up a customized room for draft night \u2014 but he reportedly maintained a 3.9 GPA at Colorado and was never involved in any off-field incidents that would point to serious character concerns.",
      "READING BETWEEN THE LINES: J. Kenyatta Cavil, the interim dean of education and sports studies at Texas Southern University, said the pushback when it came to Sanders was not a surprise.",
      "Cavil said Deion and Shedeur Sanders did a remarkable job of controlling the younger Sanders\u2019 career, moving from a private high school to Jackson State to Colorado. That proved to be a problem.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s unique in this dichotomy, is you have a coach and a son, for a period of time, who could control the space,\u201d Cavil said, later adding: \u201cThey had this ability to transform spaces that allowed them to be their unique and authentic self, which is not always acceptable in the social structure.\u201d",
      "WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS SAID: \u201cThis is a guy who\u2019s extremely accurate. He\u2019s extremely mobile. He has a lot of mental horsepower. He played the game at a high level,\" said former NFL player and front-office executive Louis Riddick, now an ESPN analyst.",
      "WHAT OTHERS SAID: The main criticisms against Sanders\u2019 football skills are that he takes too many sacks, isn\u2019t overly athletic and doesn\u2019t have great arm strength. He had opportunities during the pre-draft process to address those concerns but didn't always take advantage of opportunities to work out for scouts.",
      "\u201cFor a player who had a variety of questions, both about the talent level, how he would fit into an NFL system, how he would adjust from his play style in college, but also about the potential culture shock of for the first time playing for someone who is not his father, there were opportunities that Shedeur Sanders could have taken there,\" NFL Network's Tom Pelissero said. \u201cHe seemed to feel he was an elite category where he could choose the few teams he wanted to go to.\u201d",
      "WHAT SANDERS DID: Sanders had a productive four seasons in college and finished his career with 50 games played in four seasons \u2014 two at Jackson State and two at Colorado. He completed more than 70% of his passes for 14,353 yards and 134 touchdowns with 27 interceptions. He finished eighth in last year's Heisman Trophy voting while teammate Travis Hunter won the award. Hunter was drafted by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the No. 2 overall pick.",
      "READING BETWEEN THE LINES: It's not uncommon for a good college quarterback to be overlooked, even with great stats, because of concerns ranging from size to speed to arm strength. Famously, seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Tom Brady was the 199th overall pick out of Michigan in 2000 before embarking on one of the most successful careers in NFL history. But none of those overlooked quarterbacks had transcended the football world the way Shedeur Sanders had during his college career.",
      "WHAT SHEDEUR SANDERS SAID: Despite the embarrassing draft free fall \u2014 which included a prank call orchestrated by the son of an Atlanta Falcons coach and President Donald Trump weighing in \u2014 Sanders will have a chance to prove his worth in the NFL. His first chance is with the Browns, who have added multiple quarterbacks in the offseason in an effort to find a long-term solution.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m truly thankful to have, is the opportunity for people to actually see the real me and not be able to see stuff that could be true or not,\" Sanders said.",
      "WHAT OTHERS SAID: Browns general manager Andrew Berry traded up in the draft to land Sanders after he fell to the fifth round, feeling any possible problems were worth the risk.",
      "\u201cWe felt like he was a good, solid prospect at the most important position. We felt like it got to a point where he was probably mispriced relative to the draft. Really, the acquisition cost was pretty light, and it\u2019s a guy that we think can outproduce his draft slot.",
      "READING BETWEEN THE LINES: Cavil \u2014 the Texas Southern interim dean \u2014 said he expects the news cycle will move quickly and Sanders will have something of a reprieve until the Browns' training camp begins in the summer. In the meantime, more will come out about the quarterback's draft free fall. What really matters is how he performs from this point forward.",
      "\u201cA year from now, for the rest of his career, whatever success he has or doesn't, people will come back to this point,\u201d Cavil said. \u201cIt'll be a story of overcoming all these obstacles or somebody that couldn't get it done.\"",

      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- After retreating from their workplace diversity, equity and inclusion programs, tech companies could now face a second reckoning over their DEI work in AI products.",
      "In the White House and the Republican-led Congress, \"woke AI\u201d has replaced harmful algorithmic discrimination as a problem that needs fixing. Past efforts to \u201cadvance equity\u201d in AI development and curb the production of \u201charmful and biased outputs\u201d are a target of investigation, according to subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "And the standard-setting branch of the U.S. Commerce Department has deleted mentions of AI fairness, safety and \u201cresponsible AI\u201d in its appeal for collaboration with outside researchers. It is instead instructing scientists to focus on \u201creducing ideological bias\u201d in a way that will \u201cenable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,\u201d according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "In some ways, tech workers are used to a whiplash of Washington-driven priorities affecting their work.",
      "But the latest shift has raised concerns among experts in the field, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who several years ago was approached by Google to help make its AI products more inclusive.",
      "Back then, the tech industry already knew it had a problem with the branch of AI that trains machines to \u201csee\u201d and understand images. Computer vision held great commercial promise but echoed the historical biases found in earlier camera technologies that portrayed Black and brown people in an unflattering light.",
      "\u201cBlack people or darker skinned people would come in the picture and we\u2019d look ridiculous sometimes,\u201d said Monk, a scholar of colorism, a form of discrimination based on people\u2019s skin tones and other features.",
      "Google adopted a color scale invented by Monk that improved how its AI image tools portray the diversity of human skin tones, replacing a decades-old standard originally designed for doctors treating white dermatology patients.",
      "\u201cConsumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Now Monk wonders whether such efforts will continue in the future. While he doesn't believe that his Monk Skin Tone Scale is threatened because it's already baked into dozens of products at Google and elsewhere \u2014 including camera phones, video games, AI image generators \u2014 he and other researchers worry that the new mood is chilling future initiatives and funding to make technology work better for everyone.",
      "\u201cGoogle wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,\" Monk said. \u201cBut could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there\u2019s a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly.\u201d",
      "Trump has cut hundreds of science, technology and health funding grants touching on DEI themes, but its influence on commercial development of chatbots and other AI products is more indirect. In investigating AI companies, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the judiciary committee, said he wants to find out whether former President Joe Biden's administration \u201ccoerced or colluded with\" them to censor lawful speech.",
      "Michael Kratsios, director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, said at a Texas event this month that Biden's AI policies were \u201cpromoting social divisions and redistribution in the name of equity.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration declined to make Kratsios available for an interview but quoted several examples of what he meant. One was a line from a Biden-era AI research strategy that said: \u201cWithout proper controls, AI systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities.\u201d",
      "Even before Biden took office, a growing body of research and personal anecdotes was attracting attention to the harms of AI bias.",
      "One study showed self-driving car technology has a hard time detecting darker-skinned pedestrians, putting them in greater danger of getting run over. Another study asking popular AI text-to-image generators to make a picture of a surgeon found they produced a white man about 98% percent of the time, far higher than the real proportions even in a heavily male-dominated field.",
      "Face-matching software for unlocking phones misidentified Asian faces. Police in U.S. cities wrongfully arrested Black men based on false face recognition matches. And a decade ago, Google\u2019s own photos app sorted a picture of two Black people into a category labeled as \u201cgorillas.\u201d",
      "Even government scientists in the first Trump administration concluded in 2019 that facial recognition technology was performing unevenly based on race, gender or age.",
      "Biden's election propelled some tech companies to accelerate their focus on AI fairness. The 2022 arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT added new priorities, sparking a commercial boom in new AI applications for composing documents and generating images, pressuring companies like Google to ease its caution and catch up.",
      "Then came Google's Gemini AI chatbot \u2014 and a flawed product rollout last year that would make it the symbol of \u201cwoke AI\u201d that conservatives hoped to unravel. Left to their own devices, AI tools that generate images from a written prompt are prone to perpetuating the stereotypes accumulated from all the visual data they were trained on.",
      "Google's was no different, and when asked to depict people in various professions, it was more likely to favor lighter-skinned faces and men, and, when women were chosen, younger women, according to the company's own public research.",
      "Google tried to place technical guardrails to reduce those disparities before rolling out Gemini's AI image generator just over a year ago. It ended up overcompensating for the bias, placing people of color and women in inaccurate historical settings, such as answering a request for American founding fathers with images of men in 18th century attire who appeared to be Black, Asian and Native American. Google quickly apologized and temporarily pulled the plug on the feature, but the outrage became a rallying cry taken up by the political right.",
      "With Google CEO Sundar Pichai sitting nearby, Vice President JD Vance used an AI summit in Paris in February to decry the advancement of \u201cdownright ahistorical social agendas through AI,\u201d naming the moment when Google\u2019s AI image generator was \u201ctrying to tell us that George Washington was Black, or that America\u2019s doughboys in World War I were, in fact, women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to remember the lessons from that ridiculous moment,\u201d Vance declared at the gathering. \"And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\u201d",
      "A former Biden science adviser who attended that speech, Alondra Nelson, said the Trump administration's new focus on AI's \u201cideological bias\u201d is in some ways a recognition of years of work to address algorithmic bias that can affect housing, mortgages, health care and other aspects of people's lives.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, to say that AI systems are ideologically biased is to say that you identify, recognize and are concerned about the problem of algorithmic bias, which is the problem that many of us have been worried about for a long time,\u201d said Nelson, the former acting director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-authored a set of principles to protect civil rights and civil liberties in AI applications.",
      "But Nelson doesn't see much room for collaboration amid the denigration of equitable AI initiatives.",
      "\u201cI think in this political space, unfortunately, that is quite unlikely,\u201d she said. \u201cProblems that have been differently named \u2014 algorithmic discrimination or algorithmic bias on the one hand, and ideological bias on the other \u2014- will be regrettably seen us as two different problems.\u201d",

      "People with diseases caused by rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than other patients despite rapid recent advancements in the growing field of genetic science",
      "Emily Kramer-Golinkoff can\u2019t get enough oxygen with each breath. Advanced cystic fibrosis makes even simple things like walking or showering arduous and exhausting.",
      "She has the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S., which afflicts 40,000 Americans. But her case is caused by a rare genetic mutation, so medications that work for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis won\u2019t help her.",
      "The same dynamic plays out in other genetic conditions. Stunning advances in genetic science have revealed the subtle, insidious culprits behind these brutal diseases and have started paving the way for treatments. But patients with these exceedingly rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than those with more typical forms of these diseases \u2014 and many are now pinning hopes on experimental gene therapies.",
      "\u201cWe feel such pure joy for our friends who have been lifted from this sinking ship,\u201d said Kramer-Golinkoff, 40. \u201cBut we just feel so eager and desperate to join them. It\u2019s really hard to be in this minority of people left behind.\u201d",
      "It's not just science that is working against these patients, it's market forces. Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations.",
      "\u201cYou need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is \"mutational discrimination.\u201d",
      "Charities \u2013 including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily\u2019s Entourage \u2013 are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.",
      "While it likely won't be available for years, \u201cjust to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body.",
      "It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older \u2026 my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master\u2019s degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She\u2019s prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCF is a real monster of a disease,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with \u201cCFTR modulator\u201d therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients\u2019 overall quality of life.",
      "Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.",
      "Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.",
      "For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations \u2013 affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don\u2019t benefit from modulator therapies.",
      "While there\u2019s little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop \u201cmutation agnostic\u201d gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge push to develop these therapies,\" said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center.",
      "Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.",
      "One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily\u2019s Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff said she\u2019s more optimistic about her future these days, even as her own illness worsens. At this point, she\u2019s living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily.",
      "\u201cYou have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that\u2019s really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies. They can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d",

      "Northern District of Florida Chief Judge Mark Walker declined to dismiss a part of the lawsuit that argued Florida's restrictions give an unconstitutional advantage to Florida farmers over out-of-state competitors. Meanwhile, the judge sided with state attorneys seeking to dismiss the lawsuit and their argument that federal approval of cultivated chicken doesn't mean individual states can't ban it.",
      "U.S. regulators first signed off on the sale of what\u2019s known as \u201ccell-cultured\u201d or \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d meat in June 2023. The lawsuit had argued that Florida\u2019s law is preempted under federal laws that regulate the interstate market for meat and poultry products. Sellers say the product is a more ethical and sustainable alternative to conventionally raised chicken, beef and pork.",
      "But lawmakers in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi have called cultivated meat a threat to their states\u2019 agriculture industries and banned the sale of the product, which is made of animal cells that are fed a mix of proteins, vitamins and water and then formed into nuggets, sausages and steaks.",
      "The lawsuit was filed last year by Upside Foods, represented by the nonprofit law firm the Institute for Justice.",
      "\u201cUpside is not looking to replace conventional meat, which will always have a place at the table,\u201d Upside CEO Uma Valeti said in a statement. \"All we are asking for is the right to compete, so that Floridians can try our product and see that it is possible to have delicious meat without the need for slaughtering animals. Today\u2019s ruling is an important step toward securing that right.\u201d",
      "The governor's office and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment about the lawsuit.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis was flanked by cattle farmers last May when he signed the state\u2019s cultivated meat ban into law.",
      "\u201cWe stand with agriculture, we stand with the cattle ranchers, we stand with our farmers because we understand it\u2019s important for the backbone of the state,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cTake your fake lab-grown meat elsewhere.\u201d",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- X Corp., the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates, saying it violates First Amendment speech protections.",
      "The company's federal lawsuit filed this week also contends that the 2023 state law is preempted by a 1996 federal statute that shields social media from being held responsible for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cWhile the law's reference to banning \u2018deep fakes\u2019 might sound benign, in reality it would criminalize innocuous, election-related speech, including humor, and make social-media platforms criminally liable for censoring such speech,\" the company said in a statement. \u201cInstead of defending democracy, this law would erode it.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's law imposes criminal penalties \u2014 including jail time \u2014 for disseminating a deepfake video, image or audio if a person knows it's fake, or acts with reckless disregard to its authenticity, either within 90 days before a party nominating convention, or after the start of early voting in a primary or general election.",
      "It says the intent must be to injure a candidate or influence an election result. And it defines deepfakes as material so realistic that a reasonable person would believe it's real, and generated by artificial intelligence or other technical means.",
      "\u201cElon Musk funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the 2024 presidential election and tried to buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat,\" said the law's author, Democratic state Sen. Erin Maye Quade.",
      "\"Of course he is upset that Minnesota law prevents him from spreading deepfakes that meant to harm candidates and influence elections. Minnesota\u2019s law is clear and precise, while this lawsuit is petty, misguided and a waste of the Attorney General Office\u2019s time and resources,\u201d her statement said.",
      "Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is legally obligated to defend the constitutionality of state laws in court, said in a statement that it's \u201creviewing the lawsuit and will respond in the appropriate time and manner.\u201d",
      "The Minnesota law was already the subject of a constitutional challenge by Christopher Kohls, a content creator, and GOP state Rep. Mary Franson, who likes to post AI-generated parodies of politicians. That case is on hold while they appeal to overturn a judge's denial of their request to suspend the law.",
      "The attorney general's office argues in that case that deepfakes are a real and growing threat to free elections and democratic institutions, that the law is a legitimate and constitutional response to the problem, and that it contains important limitations on its scope that protect satire and parody.",
      "X, formerly known as Twitter, said it's the only social media platform challenging the Minnesota law, and that it has also challenged other laws it considers infringements of free speech, such as a 2024 California political deepfakes law that a judge has blocked.",
      "X said in its statement that its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d feature allows users to flag content they consider problematic, and that it's been adopted by Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. The company's lawsuit said its \u201cAuthenticity Policy\u201d and \u201cGrok AI\u201d tool provide additional safeguards.",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on technology law, said in an interview Friday that it's important to separate the free-speech issues from whatever one thinks about the controversial Musk.",
      "\u201cI'm almost positive that this will be struck down,\u201d Rozenshtein said.",
      "There's no exception under the First Amendment for false or misleading political speech, even lies, he said. And the potential for criminal penalties gives social media companies like X and Facebook \u201can incentive to take down anything that might be a deepfake. ... You're going to censor a massive amount to comply with this law.\u201d",
      "Deepfakes aren't good, but it would be nice to get evidence that they're causing actual problems before imposing such limits on free speech, the professor said. And while it's easy to focus on the supply of misinformation, the large demand for it is the problem.",
      "\u201cPeople want to be fooled, and it's very bad for our democracy, but it\u2019s not something I think can be solved with a deepfakes ban,\" he said.",

      "BYD made more electric vehicles last year than Tesla, selling 3.52 million EVs in China, up 28% from a year earlier. Its strength in plug-in hybrids has helped as Chinese increasingly opt for the fallback of a fuel engine.",
      "The company, based in southern China's Shenzhen, recently announced an ultra-fast EV charging system it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about as long as a fill-up. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",
      "The Chinese company started out making batteries and has been refining its battery and energy storage technology while building an auto empire that is expanding outside China.",
      "While BYD\u2019s fanciest, latest premium models are expected to sell for up to about $40,000, it also makes much less expensive EVs including the Seagull, which sells for around $12,000 in China.",

      "Li began making strategic overseas acquisitions early on, buying Sweden\u2019s Volvo Car Co. from Ford Motor in 2010. Geely's purchase of a 49.9% stake in Malaysia\u2019s Proton gave it a 51% stake in luxury sports car brand Lotus. It formed a 50-50 joint venture to make Smart city cars with Germany\u2019s Daimler AG. It also works with Renault SA of France on powertrains and owns a stake in Aston Martin Lagonda.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has ordered sharper scrutiny of America&rsquo;s colleges and the accreditors that oversee them",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has ordered sharper scrutiny of America\u2019s colleges and the accreditors that oversee them",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has ordered sharper scrutiny of America\u2019s colleges and the accreditors that oversee them, part of his escalating campaign to end what he calls \" wokeness \u201d and diversity efforts in education.",
      "In a series of executive actions signed Wednesday, Trump targeted universities that he views as liberal adversaries to his political agenda. One order called for harder enforcement of a federal law requiring colleges to disclose their financial ties with foreign sources, while another called for a shakeup of the accrediting bodies that decide whether colleges can accept federal financial aid awarded to students.",
      "Trump also ordered the Education Department to root out efforts to ensure equity in discipline in the nation's K-12 schools. Previous guidance from Democratic administrations directed schools not to disproportionately punish underrepresented minorities such as Black and Native American students. The administration says equity efforts amount to racial discrimination.",
      "Colleges\u2019 financial ties with foreign sources have long been a concern among Republicans, especially ties with China and other countries with adversarial relationships with the U.S. It became a priority during Trump\u2019s first term and reemerged last week as the White House grasped for leverage in its escalating battle with Harvard University.",
      "The White House said it needed to take action because Harvard and other colleges have routinely violated a federal disclosure law, which has been unevenly enforced since it was passed in the 1980s. Known as Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the law requires colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more.",
      "Last week, the Education Department demanded records from Harvard over foreign financial ties spanning the past decade, accusing the school of filing \u201cincomplete and inaccurate disclosures.\u201d Trump's administration is sparring with Harvard over the university's refusal to accept a list of demands over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests as well as its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "In the executive order, Trump calls on the Education Department and the attorney general to step up enforcement of the law and take action against colleges that violate it, including a cutoff of federal money.",
      "The Trump administration intends to \u201cend the secrecy surrounding foreign funds in American educational institutions\u201d and protect against \u201cforeign exploitation,\u201d the order said.",
      "It was applauded by Republicans, including Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. He accused China of exploiting academic ties to steal research and \u201cindoctrinate students.\u201d",
      "Another order aims at accrediting bodies that set standards colleges must meet to accept federal financial aid from students. Trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul the industry, saying it was \u201cdominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.\u201d",
      "Often overlooked as an obscure branch of college oversight, accreditors play an important role in shaping colleges in many aspects, with standards that apply all the way from colleges\u2019 governing boards to classroom curriculum.",
      "Trump's executive order is the opening salvo in what could be a lengthy battle to overhaul the accrediting industry. Chief among his priorities is to strip accreditors of DEI requirements imposed on colleges. Some accreditors have already dropped or stopped enforcing such standards amid Trump\u2019s DEI crackdown.",
      "Trump\u2019s order calls on the government to suspend or terminate accreditors that discriminate in the name of DEI. Instead, it calls on accreditors to focus more squarely on the student outcomes of colleges and programs they oversee.",
      "The president wants to make it easier for new accreditors to compete with the 19 that are now authorized to work on behalf of the federal government. As it stands, new accreditors looking to be recognized by the government must undergo an arduous process that traditionally takes years. Trump\u2019s order said it should be \u201ctransparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of pushing schools to adopt a divisive DEI ideology, accreditors should be focused on helping schools improve graduation rates and graduates\u2019 performance in the labor market,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.",
      "Trump also invoked opposition to equity efforts in his order on school discipline. The edict signed Wednesday seeks a return to \u201ccommon sense school discipline,\u201d allowing decisions to be based solely on students\u2019 behavior and actions, McMahon said.",
      "Another executive order instructs government agencies and departments to no longer rely on \u201cdisparate impact theories.\u201d Under the disparate impact standard, policies and practices that disproportionately impact minorities and other protected groups could be challenged regardless of their intent.",
      "In many schools around the country, Black students have been more likely to receive punishments that remove them from the classroom, including suspensions, expulsions and being transferred to alternative schools. A decade ago, those differences became the target of a reform movement spurred by the same reckoning that gave rise to Black Lives Matter. The movement elevated the concept of the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d \u2014 the notion that being kicked out of school, or dropping out, increases the chance of arrest and imprisonment years later.",
      "Federal guidelines to address racial disparities in school discipline first came from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2014. Federal officials urged schools not to suspend, expel or refer students to law enforcement except as a last resort, and encouraged restorative justice practices that did not push students out of the classroom. Those rules were rolled back by Trump\u2019s first administration, but civil rights regulations at federal and state levels still mandate the collection of data on discipline.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump directed McMahon to issue new school discipline guidance within 60 days. The order also calls for a review of nonprofit organizations that have promoted discipline policies rooted in equity and ensure they don\u2019t receive federal money.",
      "Another order creates a federal task force focused on giving America\u2019s students training on artificial intelligence as early as kindergarten. It would work to develop new online learning resources.",
      "Trump is also establishing a White House initiative to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Among other efforts, it would seek to promote private-sector partnerships with HBCUs and schools\u2019 workforce preparation in industries like technology and finance.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk intends to focus more on his job as Tesla CEO, but it\u2019s unclear if the billionaire will be able to solve a big problem of his own making: damage to its brand",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk has been called a Moonshot Master, the Edison of Our Age and the Architect of the Future, but he's got a big problem at his car company and it's not clear he can fix it: damage to its brand.",
      "Sales have plunged for Tesla amid protests and boycotts over Musk's embrace of far right-wing views. Profits have been sliced by two-thirds so far this year, and rivals from China, Europe and the U.S. are pouncing.",
      "On Tuesday came some relief as Musk announced in an earnings call with investors that he would be scaling back his government cost-cutting job in Washington to a \u201cday or two per week\" to focus more on his old job as Tesla's boss.",
      "Investors pushed up Tesla's stock 5% Wednesday, though there are plenty of challenges ahead.",
      "Musk seemed to downplay the role that brand damage played in the drop in first-quarter sales on the investor call. Instead, he emphasized something more fleeting \u2014 an upgrade to Tesla's best-selling Model Y that forced a shutdown of factories and pinched both supply and demand.",
      "While financial analysts following the company have noted that potential buyers probably held back while waiting for the upgrade, hurting results, even the most bullish among them say the brand damage is real, and more worrisome.",
      "\u201cThis is a full blown crisis,\u201d said Wedbush Securities' normally upbeat Dan Ives earlier this month. In a note to its clients, JP Morgan warned of \u201cunprecedented brand damage.\"",
      "Musk dismissed the protests against Tesla on the call as the work of people angry at his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency because \u201cthose who are receiving the waste and fraud wish it to continue.\u201d",
      "But the protests in Europe, thousands of miles from Washington, came after Musk supported far-right politicians there. Angry Europeans hung Musk in effigy in Milan, projected an image of him doing a straight-arm salute on a Tesla factory in Berlin and put up posters in London urging people not to buy \u201cSwasticars\u201d from him.",
      "Sales in Europe have gone into a free fall in the first three months of this year \u2014 down 39%. In Germany, sales plunged 62%.",
      "Another worrying sign: On Tuesday, Tesla backed off its earlier promise that sales would recover this year after dropping in 2024 for the first time a dozen years. Tesla said the global trade situation was too uncertain and declined to repeat the forecast.",
      "Meanwhile, Tesla's competition is stealing its customers.",
      "Among its fiercest rivals now is Chinese giant BYD. Earlier this year, the EV maker announced it had developed an electric battery that can charge within minutes. And Tesla\u2019s European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real Tesla alternatives just as popular opinion has turned against Musk.",
      "Tesla's share of the EV market in the U.S. has dropped from two-thirds to less than half, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "Another rival, Google parent Alphabet, is already ahead of Tesla in an area that Musk has promised will help remake his company: Cybercabs.",
      "One of the highlights of Tesla\u2019s call Tuesday was Musk sticking with his previous prediction that it will l aunch driverless cabs without steering wheels and pedals in Austin, Texas, in June, and in other cities soon after.",
      "But Google\u2019s service, called Waymo, already has logged millions of driverless cybercab trips in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "Musk also told analysts that this driverless capability will be available on the Tesla vehicles already on the road through software updates over the air, and put a timeline on it: \u201cThere will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously in the second half of the year.\"",
      "But he has made similar promises before, only to miss his deadlines, such as in April 2019 when he vowed full automation by the end of the next year. He repeated the prediction, moving up the date, several more times, in following years.",
      "A big problem is federal investigators have not given the all-clear that Tesla vehicles can drive completely on their own safely. Among other probes, safety regulators are looking into Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving, which is only partial self-driving, for its tie to accidents in low-visibility conditions like when there is sun glare.",
      "In competition with rivals in the U.S., Tesla currently has one clear advantage: It will get hurt by less by tariffs because most of its vehicles are built in the countries where they are sold, including those in its biggest market, the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs are still tough on a company where margins are still low, but we do have localized supply chains,\u201d Musk said Tuesday. \u201cThat puts us in a strong position.\u201d",
      "The company also reconfirmed that a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, will be ready for customers in the first half of this year. That could help boost sales.",
      "Another plus: The company had a blow out first quarter in its energy storage business. And Musk has promised to be producing 5,000 Optimus robots, another Tesla business, by the end of the year.",
      "Even after falling nearly 50% from its December highs, Tesla's stock is still very richly valued based on the one yardstick that really matters in the long run: its earnings.",
      "At 110 times its expected per share earnings this year, the stock is valued more than 25 times higher than General Motors. The average stock on in the S&P 500 index trades at less than 20 times earnings.",
      "That leaves Tesla little margin for error if something goes wrong.",

      "The legal licensing body said in a news release Monday that it will ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.",
      "\u201cThe debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,\u201d Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.\u201d",
      "In February, the new exam led to complaints after many test-takers were unable to complete their bar exams. The online testing platforms repeatedly crashed before some applicants even started. Others struggled to finish and save essays, experienced screen lags and error messages and could not copy and paste text, the Times reported earlier.",
      "According to a recent presentation by the State Bar, 100 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions were made by Kaplan and 48 were drawn from a first-year law students exam. A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar\u2019s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence.",

      "\u201cThe State Bar has admitted they employed a company to have a non-lawyer use AI to draft questions that were given on the actual bar exam,\u201d she said. \u201cThey then paid that same company to assess and ultimately approve of the questions on the exam, including the questions the company authored.\u201d",

      "Backed by three Nobel Prize winners and other advocates and experts, Hedley and nine other ex-OpenAI workers sent a letter this week to the two state attorneys general.",
      "The coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI's charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.",

      "\u201cThis structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI's billions of dollars of charitable assets.",
      "Jennings said last fall she would \u201creview any such transaction to ensure that the public\u2019s interests are adequately protected.\" Bonta\u2019s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can\u2019t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.",
      "OpenAI's co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what's known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity's benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.",
      "OpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.",
      "While some of the signatories of this week's letter support Musk's lawsuit, Hedley said others are \u201cunderstandably cynical\u201d because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.",
      "The signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton, who won last year's Nobel Prize in physics, and Stuart Russell.",

      "Hedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.",
      "In recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.",
      "\u201cThe costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.\u201d",

And it's not clear when the current crisis, which began in 2023 and is blamed on warming oceans, will end.",
      "\u201cWe may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event,\u201d said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",

      "That's deadly to corals, which are key to seafood production, tourism and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms. Coral reefs are sometimes dubbed \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d because they support high levels of biodiversity \u2014 approximately 25% of all marine species can be found in, on and around coral reefs.",
      "Coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them and are a food source for the corals. Prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds, and the coral eject them. A stark white skeleton is left behind, and the weakened coral is at heightened risk of dying.",
      "The bleaching event has been so severe that NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program has had to add levels to its bleaching alert scale to account for the growing risk of coral death.",
      "Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral. One Dutch lab has worked with coral fragments, including some taken from off the coast of the Seychelles, to propagate them in a zoo so that they might be used someday to repopulate wild coral reefs if needed. Other projects, including one off Florida, have worked to rescue corals endangered by high heat and nurse them back to health before returning them to the ocean.",
      "But scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, such as carbon dioxide and methane.",
      "\u201cThe best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels \u2026 everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "\u201cI think people really need to recognize what they\u2019re doing \u2026 inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs,\u201d said Melanie McField, co-chair of the Caribbean Steering Committee for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, a network of scientists that monitors reefs throughout the world.",
      "The group's update comes as President Donald Trump has moved aggressively in his second term to boost fossil fuels and roll back clean energy programs, which he says is necessary for economic growth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a government right now that is working very hard to destroy all of these ecosystems ... removing these protections is going to have devastating consequences,\" Eakin said.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:37:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Since Donald Trump took office 100 days ago, the president and his administration have faced at least 220 lawsuits challenging nearly every element of his agenda.",
    "story": [
      "The administration has been sued over nearly every element of Trump's agenda.",
      "Since Donald Trump took office 100 days ago, the president and his administration have faced an average of more than two lawsuits per day, challenging nearly every element of his agenda.",
      "The breakneck pace of the president's policies has been matched in nearly equal force by a flood of litigation -- at least 220 lawsuits in courts across the country -- challenging more than two dozen executive orders, the firing of twenty high-ranking government officials, and dozens of other executive actions.",
      "While the Trump administration has had some victories in the courts, federal judges have blocked key parts of Trump's agenda ranging from parts of his immigration policy and military guidelines to his effort to roll back diversity and equity initiatives.",
      "\"The administration has basically gone on a shock-and-awe bombing campaign,\" said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University. \"There is a huge amount of what they are currently doing that they probably could have achieved lawfully, but they have crashed through any of the existing legal guardrails in an attempt to do everything, everywhere, all at once.\"",
      "The suits have come at a steady clip -- 20 in January, approximately 70 in both February and March, and about 50 so far in April -- as the Trump administration has rolled out its new policies.",
      "Approximately 60 of those cases have focused on the president's immigration policy, with courts so far blocking the president's attempts to remove birthright citizenship, withhold funding from sanctuary cities, remove noncitizens to countries other than their place of origin with little-to-no due process, and strip thousands of their temporary protected status. Some of those policies have earned the president rebukes from judges questioning the rationale for his unilateral immigration policy.",
      "\"It has become ever more apparent that to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals,\" U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, a Reagan appointee, said of Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. \"There are moments in the world's history when people look back and ask, 'Where were the lawyers, where were the judges?' In these moments, the rule of law becomes especially vulnerable. I refuse to let that beacon go dark today.\"",
      "Courts have also blocked the Trump administration from effectively banning transgender people from military service, limiting gender-affirming care, requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, attempting to freeze trillions in funding to states and nonprofits, and moving to block billions in foreign aid.",
      "But in many cases federal courts have not stopped the president outright -- tentatively allowing the mass firing of thousands of government employees, greenlighting a historic federal buyout, and, for now, allowing the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development. The Department of Education and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau are also undergoing massive staffing reductions as judges actively consider the legality of the Trump administration's cuts.",
      "The president's supporters have decried the litigation as a \"judicial coup,\" while those opposing his policies have praised judges for serving as a check against the administration. But the seemingly constant conflict between the Trump administration and the judiciary could risk permanent damage to the separation of powers at the heart of the Constitution, some judges have warned.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both. This is a losing proposition all around,\" wrote federal Judge Harvie Wilkinson III, a Reagan appointee who rebuked the Trump administration's inaction after it was ordered to facilitate the return of a man from a Salvadoran prison.",
      "In the first hundred days since Trump took office, lawyers challenging his actions in court alleged that his administration violated court orders at least six times, according to court records reviewed by ABC News.",
      "While no judge has held members of the Trump administration in contempt of court, two federal judges have sharply rebuked the government for acting in \"bad faith\" during ongoing lawsuits. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg -- who heard arguments over the deportation of two planeloads of alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act -- an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- ultimately determined the Trump administration likely violated his order by failing to return the migrants to the United States.",
      "An appeals court temporarily blocked Judge Boasberg from beginning the process of contempt proceedings, but his most recent ruling invoked the words of former Chief Justice John Marshall to describe the stakes of the Trump administration's actions.",
      "\"The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders -- especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it. To permit such officials to freely 'annul the judgments of the courts of the United States' would not just 'destroy the rights acquired under those judgments'; it would make 'a solemn mockery' of 'the Constitution itself,'\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "Lawyers representing the Trump administration have argued that Judge Boasberg\u2019s order fell outside his jurisdiction because the flights in question had left U.S. airspace, and have insisted that a federal judge should not dictate U.S. foreign policy.",
      "The Trump administration has also faced legal challenges for its refusal to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native living in Maryland, to the United States after he was mistakenly deported to his home country despite an order barring his deportation there due to fear of persecution.",
      "The administration has so far declined to bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States despite the Supreme Court ordering his release, though administration officials have complied with a lower court\u2019s order to provide regular updates about him.",
      "The administration has rebutted orders to bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States despite the Supreme Court ordering them to facilitate his release.",
      "Judge Wilkinson, in the meantime, has condemned the Trump administration's attempt to send alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison.",
      "\"The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,\" he wrote. \"This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\"",
      "In an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, 65% of respondents said Trump's administration is trying to avoid complying with federal court orders, and 62% said they don't think his administration respects the rule of law.",
      "With the Trump administration just 100 days in, most lawsuits have not made their way through the appeals process to the Supreme Court -- but the Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to block some court orders on an emergency basis.",
      "Those appeals have led to some losses for the Trump administration -- among them a 5-4 Supreme Court decision ordering the Trump administration to unfreeze nearly $2 billion in foreign aid funds for work that aid groups have already completed on the government's behalf.",
      "On the flip side, the Supreme Court -- citing largely technical reasons -- handed the Trump administration a series of temporary wins, including vacating an order blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. In that case, the justices opted to throw out the case because the case was filed in the wrong court, declining to weigh in on the merits of the issue.",
      "The Supreme Court also handed the Trump administration a temporary win by blocking a lower court's ruling that barred the Trump administration from firing thousands of probationary government employees without cause. The district judge who blocked the firings slammed the Trump administration for using a \"sham\" and \"gimmick\" to fire thousands of federal workers.",
      "\"I just want to say it is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\" U.S. District Judge William Alsup said. \"That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "But the Supreme Court vacated his order because the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit -- a group of unions and interest groups -- lacked the legal standing to bring the lawsuit.",
      "Over the next month, the Supreme Court is set to hold oral arguments for the first time in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's attempt to eliminate birthright citizenship as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, which confers American citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil regardless of their parents' immigration or citizenship status.",
      "The Trump administration also asked the Supreme Court to take up a legal challenge to the Pentagon's transgender service ban after three judges blocked it from taking effect.",
      "Despite President Trump's vow to restore free speech and end censorship, his administration has faced multiple lawsuits challenging his actions on the grounds they violate the First Amendment.",
      "Four law firms have sued the Trump administration after they were targeted for their past work, with each firm arguing the Trump administration unlawfully retaliated against them and violated their First Amendment rights. Judges have temporarily blocked the Trump administration from targeting Susman Godfrey LLP, Jenner & Block LLP, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, and Perkins Coie LLP.",
      "\"The framers of our Constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,\" U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan said regarding the order targeting Susman Godfrey LLP.",
      "At least nine law firms have already acquiesced to the Trump administration's demands, agreeing to donate a total of $940 million in legal services to promote causes supported by the president.",
      "After the Trump administration attempted to freeze more than $2 billion dollars in federal funding to Harvard University, the country's oldest school cited the First Amendment in their lawsuit challenging the funding freeze, arguing the \"threat of additional funding cuts will chill Harvard's exercise of its First Amendment rights.\" More than two in three Americans support Harvard in their ongoing dispute with the Trump administration, according to an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.",
      "\"Harvard will be unable to make decisions regarding its faculty hiring, academic programs, student admissions, and other core academic matters without fear that those decisions will run afoul of government censors' views on acceptable levels of ideological or viewpoint diversity on campus,\" Harvard\u2019s lawyers argued.",
      "At least nine current or recent students have challenged the Trump administration's attempt to revoke their visas or green cards, with several alleging they were targeted for their outspoken support of Palestinians. The Trump administration's policy of revoking student visas marks the government's most aggressive approach in more than two decades and the first time students have been targeted over their speech, according to immigration attorney Renata Castro.",
      "\"The government is looking at speech -- the exercise of free speech -- and using that to dig into perceived immigration violations so that they can revoke student visas,\" Castro said.",
      "The Trump administration also invoked a rarely used law -- 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 237 (a)(4)(C)(i) -- to justify removing noncitizens such as Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who was a prominent figure during student protests at Columbia, because he and others allegedly harm U.S. foreign policy.",
      "According to an analysis of past immigration cases conducted by political scientists Graeme Blair and David Hausman, the United States had only used that provision as a basis to remove a noncitizen two times in the last 25 years.",
      "\"The Trump administration is targeting me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent,\" Khalil wrote in a public letter last month from an ICE detention facility in Louisiana. \"At stake are not just our voices, but the fundamental civil liberties of all.\"",
      "Earlier this month, an immigration judge ruled that Khalil can be deported on the grounds that he threatens U.S. foreign policy. While he remained in ICE detention and prepared an appeal, Khalil\u2019s wife gave birth to their child last week.",

      "An administration official confirmed that the 25% tariff on finished foreign-made cars and parts will remain -- but today's announcement will prevent tariffs from stacking on top of other tariffs he's imposed, such as duties on steel and aluminum.",
      "Trump's 25% tariff on foreign auto parts goes into effect on Saturday and automakers will also be reimbursed for those tariffs up to an amount equal to 3.75% of the value of a U.S.-made car for one year. Reimbursement would fall to 2.5% of the car's value in a second year, and then completely phased out altogether.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent touted the tariff adjustment as a means of ensuring carmakers bring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump has had meetings with both domestic and foreign auto producers, and he's committed to bring back auto production to the US. We want to give the automakers a path to do that quickly, efficiently and create as many jobs as possible,\" Bessent said.",

    "summary": "The poll finds that Americans widely oppose the U.S. trying to take control of Canada and Greenland, sending U.S. citizens to foreign prisons and a third Trump term.",
    "story": [
      "A majority take Trump at his word when he talks about his potential actions.",
      "Most Americans take President Donald Trump at his word when he talks about sending American citizens to foreign prisons, serving a third term as president and trying to take control of Greenland and Canada -- even as sweeping majorities oppose each of these potential actions.",
      "About 7 in 10 adults in this ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll think Trump is serious when he talks about sending American citizens who are convicted of violent crimes to prisons in other countries (71%) and the United States trying to take control of Greenland (68%).",
      "Fewer, but still a broad 62%, say the same about his serving a third term, even though the Constitution prohibits him from running again. A slim majority, 53%, think Trump is serious when he talks about the United States trying to take control of Canada.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean most people think these are good ideas: The survey, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, finds that Americans by wide margins oppose these proposals. At the high end, a vast 86% oppose the United States trying to take control of Canada. Eighty percent oppose Trump serving a third term, 76% oppose trying to take control of Greenland and 66% oppose sending U.S. citizens to foreign prisons.",
      "See PDF for full results.",
      "For his part, Trump insisted in an interview last week that he wasn\u2019t trolling about trying to take control of Canada and Greenland. He also has said he is not joking about running for a third term; upping the ante, Trump 2028 merchandise appeared for sale on the Trump Organization\u2019s website last Thursday.",
      "Unsurprisingly, these proposals are especially well received by the 39% of Americans who approve of the way Trump is handling his job as president. One, indeed, reaches majority support -- sending U.S. citizens who are convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons, backed by 59% of Trump approvers.",
      "Half of those in his base, 49%, support the United States trying to take control of Greenland. Forty-three percent in this group like the third-term idea; taking control of Canada lags, even among Trump approvers, at 29%.",
      "Kidding me?",
      "Notably, too, Republicans, conservatives and Trump approvers are most likely to say he\u2019s not serious about any of these proposals. On the other side of the political spectrum, Democrats, liberals and Trump disapprovers are far more apt to think he means it.",
      "Just 35% of Republicans think Trump is serious about taking over Canada, compared with 75% of Democrats. Thirty-eight percent of Republicans think he\u2019s serious about a third term, compared with 88% of Democrats. And while more Republicans -- just shy of six in 10 -- think he\u2019s serious about taking control of Greenland and sending U.S. prisoners abroad, again, these go much higher among Democrats.",
      "On each item:",
      "Third term",
      "Opposition to a third term is substantial even among some of the key support groups that elected Trump last fall, including white men without four-year college degrees (74% of whom oppose another Trump term), white evangelical Protestants (70%), conservatives (67%) and Republicans (60%).",
      "Wishful thinking may be a factor for some: Among Republicans who think Trump is serious about a third term, support for the idea rises to 60%. That compares with 24% among Republicans who don\u2019t think he\u2019s serious. On the other hand, a vast majority of Democrats (88%) think he\u2019s serious about a third term; nearly none of them (3%) support it.",
      "Canada/Greenland",
      "When it comes to Canada and Greenland, perceptions of Trump\u2019s intentions are associated with broader approval of his handling of U.S. relations with other countries -- which has a strong partisan flavor. Among people who approve of his handling of international relations -- 51% and 30%, respectively -- support trying to take control of Greenland and Canada. Among those who disapprove of Trump\u2019s work on international relations, support for these actions drops to 4% in the case of Greenland and 3% for Canada.",
      "Notably, in partisan terms, 45% of Republicans support trying to take control of Greenland. That drops to 27% who support trying to take control of Canada.",
      "Deporting Americans",
      "As reported Friday, 47% of Americans support sending undocumented immigrants who are suspected members of a criminal group to El Salvador prisons without a court hearing. Fifty-seven percent in this group also support shipping out U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes, while 41% oppose it.",
      "At 32% overall, support for sending convicted Americans to foreign prisons peaks in especially Trump-friendly groups, including 59% of those who approve of his work in office, 58% of people who call themselves very conservative and 57% of Republicans. Support drops to 30% of independents and 12% of Democrats.",

    "summary": "Democrats argue that opinions on Trump and Republicans give them an opening to flip the U.S. House of Representatives.",
    "story": [
      "House Republicans say Trump and his agenda have \"historic momentum.\"",
      "Democrats, responding to the 100-day mark of President Donald Trump's second term, argue that the American public's opinion of the White House and Republicans in Congress -- as well as consternation around high prices -- give them an opening to flip the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2026.",
      "In a strategy memo obtained exclusively by ABC News, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the campaign arm of House Democrats, wrote, \"In just 100 days, House Republicans and Donald Trump have lost the support of the American people and left a trail of broken promises that will cost them the House majority next year.\"",
      "Recent polls show approval ratings for Trump and congressional Republicans are underwater -- although congressional Democrats have sometimes performed even worse. In a recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, Trump beats Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems.",
      "The DCCC, however, argues in the memo that Democrats have momentum. The group pointed to ads from some Republican members during the 2024 campaign cycle where they said they would work to get costs down, claiming that they and others have abandoned those promises. The group also alleged that the recent budget blueprint passed by House Republicans will potentially lead to cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Republicans have argued that the budget blueprint does not and will not threaten any benefits or entitlements and that Democrats are causing undue fear. Some also blame actions by the previous White House under Democratic President Joe Biden or factors outside of anyone's control have caused higher prices.",
      "\"The DCCC and House Democrats will continue to fight back and hold Republicans accountable for their broken promises ... With every new bill that gets introduced, committee meeting held, and amendment vote taken, the American people will know that Republicans don\u2019t work for them, they work for the billionaires,\" the Democratic group wrote.",
      "And looking to 2026, the DCCC added, \"Their trail of broken promises have helped to put House Democrats on offense with an expansive battleground map, including more initial Districts in Play than any cycle since 2018. The DCCC will continue to build upon this momentum on our way to taking back the House next year.\"",
      "Republicans held on to a slim majority in the House in the 2024 election.",
      "The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the campaign arm of House Republicans, has expressed confidence that the GOP will hold the House in the 2026 midterms. The group celebrated Trump's 100 day mark on Tuesday as a milestone for momentum for an agenda the group said is revitalizing the country.",
      "NRCC chair Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., wrote in a statement on Tuesday, \"In just 100 days, President Trump has reignited American greatness. He's secured our border, put America back on top, and restored the American Dream. House Republicans will continue working with him and building on this historic momentum.\"",
      "The DCCC's memo comes as Democratic officials and other figures mark 100 days of Trump's second term in office, although the party is still divided over how to rebuild after its losses in 2024.",
      "To mark the 100-day milestone, Democratic mayors and governors have been pointing to federal government spending cuts or new policies that they say have a deleterious impact on their states.",
      "A few well-known governors, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker -- who created buzz during remarks on Sunday in New Hampshire when he said that \"these Republicans cannot know a moment of peace\" -- will be holding a virtual town hall on Tuesday night about \"how Democratic governors are standing up to protect the people in their states,\" according to the Democratic Governors Association.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic members of Congress and party officials have been marking the run-up to the 100-day mark with town halls and protests. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., staged an hours-long \"sit-in\" on the House steps on Sunday to protest Congressional Republicans' budget plans.",
      "Some Democrats have argued that the disparate responses to the administration are actually a strength for the party while it is locked out of power in Washington.",
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was the running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, said at a talk on Monday night that the Democratic Party needs to \"flood the zone\" and \"fill every single lane, and if there's one that's better than another, then let's all pick that lane and do more of that.\"",
      "Harris herself is set to deliver remarks on Wednesday in San Francisco, one day after the administration's 100-day mark, at the 20th anniversary celebration for Emerge, an organization that supports Democratic women running for office.",

    "summary": "Doctors and public health specialists say they view the administration's actions, such as firings or questioning established research, as an \"attack\" on science.",
    "story": [
      "Officials have been questioning what is believed to be established science.",
      "The first 100 days of President Donald Trump's second term have been filled with mass firings, cancellations of research grants, university funding cuts and questions over what should be studied.",
      "Thousands of people have been let go at federal agencies and critical research has been put on hold. Additionally, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines and antidepressant medications despite dozens of studies proving they are safe and effective.",
      "Doctors and public health specialists critical of the administration tell ABC News they view these actions as an \"attack\" on science, damaging the reputation of respected agencies and by questioning what is believed to be established science.",
      "\"It's completely unprecedented,\" Steve Cohen, senior vice dean of Columbia University's School of Professional Studies and a professor of public affairs at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, told ABC News. \"It's frankly a little unhinged. I've never seen anything like it.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "An HHS official told ABC News that framing the actions of the admiration as an \"attack\" is \"fundamentally dishonest.\"",
      "\"Further reviewing pharmaceutical products with gold standard science and common sense is not an'\"attack on science' \u2014 it's what the American people have asked for and deserve,\" the official said. \" Let's be clear: Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine \u2014 he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.\"",
      "Thousands of layoffs",
      "Earlier this month, HHS began to lay off 10,000 workers as part of a massive restructuring plan.",
      "Sources previously told ABC News that affected offices included most of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health, key offices in the Center for Tobacco Products, most of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the entire assisted reproductive technology team at the CDC.",
      "There have also been local impacts in communities due to federal layoffs. ABC News previously reported in March, the CDC was poised to send its lead 'disease detectives' to Milwaukee amid an ongoing lead crisis in schools, but the entire division was cut under sweeping HHS layoffs, leaving local health officials without help they were relying on.",
      "Erik Svendsen, the director of the division that oversaw the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention branch, previously told ABC News that what's happening in Milwaukee is a real world example of the impact of their absence.",
      "\"Without us, there is no other unit at the federal level that is here to support them in doing what they need to do,\" he said.",
      "On Monday, officials in Milwaukee announced two additional schools are closing due to this crisis",
      "Despite Kennedy saying some programs and employees would soon be reinstated because they were mistakenly cut, it still leaves thousands of federal employees without jobs.",
      "Scientists have also been laid off at NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Cohen said these firings have put studies on hold and have greatly reduced the capacity of the federal government to review research.",
      "\"Scientists inside agencies, whether they're environmental scientists or medical scientists or people focusing on vaccines or drugs, are being fired, and so some of the research capacity in Washington, in the federal government is being eliminated, and also their ability to judge proposals from universities,\" he said.",
      "\"The only place I haven't seen [firings] happen yet are the laboratories,\" Cohen added.",
      "Cuts that are currently proposed or have already been implemented include the elimination of the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV Policy, created by Brett Giroir, the former U.S. assistant secretary for health.",
      "Giroir, who helped convince Trump in his first term to set a goal to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S., wrote in a post on social media last week that the president could ruin his legacy and mission with such cuts.",
      "Canceling research grants, funding cuts to universities",
      "Millions of dollars' worth of grants have been terminated at the National Institutes of Health related to studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) because they do not \"effectuate\" the \"priorities\" of President Donald Trump's administration, according to copies of termination letters sent to grant recipients and viewed by ABC News.",
      "Dr. Harold Varmus, a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and former director of the NIH, said these terminations are \"detrimental\" because they may be affecting people in the middle of clinical trials, or affecting the early stages of experimental work.",
      "Research projects focusing on minority populations have major benefits, Varmus noted.",
      "\"The purpose of health research in this country is to address problems faced by everybody and to explore every facet of a population that may affect their health,\" he said. \"To single out certain categories of individuals who would not be appropriate to study seems ludicrous to me ... one of the great strengths of America is that we are diverse.\"",
      "Universities have also been threatened with funding cuts -- or have seen funds frozen -- if they don't fulfill their obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to protect Jewish students on campus and to end race-based programs.",
      "Cohen believes universities are at odds with the administration because some on the political right view universities as \"left wing.\" By \"weakening the finances of universities, they can force them to change the ideologies that they believe are being promoted in the classrooms,\" he argued.",
      "The problem with this idea, according to Cohen, is that the administration's actions are hurting the least ideological parts of universities, such as engineering schools or medical centers. At Columbia, for example, several institutes and centers are conducting Alzheimer's research, he said.",
      "\"Those are the places that are being attacked,\" Cohen said. \"It's pretty ironic, but the greatest danger, actually, is that one of America's fundamental economic strengths is the creativity and the innovation of our scientists, and that is now under attack by the Trump administration.\"",
      "Questioning safety, efficacy of vaccines",
      "Kennedy has shared vaccine skepticism in the past and has continued to do so as HHS secretary.",
      "In the wake of several ongoing measles outbreaks and over 800 cases so far this year, Kennedy has shared contradicting views about vaccines.",
      "In a post on X on April 6, he said that \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles\" is to receive the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, in a post later that evening, he said more than 300 children have been treated with an antibiotic and a steroid, neither of which are cures for measles.",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the statements Kennedy has made in support of the MMR vaccine are \"half-hearted.\"",
      "\"The reason I say 'half-hearted' or insufficient is because each time he talks about using the MMR vaccine, he qualifies it,\" Hotez told ABC News. \"He then draws this false equivalency between either getting the MMR vaccine or this cocktail of interventions that would do absolutely nothing.\"",
      "Last month, HHS confirmed that the CDC will study \"all the potential culprits\" including whether vaccines cause autism despite numerous existing studies already showing there is no link.",
      "Hotez said epidemiologic studies show that children who received either the MMR vaccine, or vaccines containing thimerosal -- a compound used as a preservative in vaccines -- are not more likely to be diagnosed autism than kids who didn't receive those vaccines.",
      "Additionally, Hotez said about 100 genes have been identified that are involved in the development of autism, many by the Broad Institute at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "He believes rising rates of autism diagnoses are likely due to wider testing and expanding diagnostic criteria. Hotez added that there could be an environmental exposure influencing autism genes, but that it's not vaccines.",
      "In 2017, he discussed with Kennedy an investigation looking at \"about half a dozen chemical exposures\" in early pregnancies but Kennedy \"had no interest,\" according to Hotez, who later documented these conversations in a book he published in 2018.",
      "\"He apparently seems to not understand the science or doesn't care about the science. He's got his fixed beliefs and doesn't want to let any of the facts or scientific findings get in the way of his fixed belief,\" Hotez said. \"And it's completely irresponsible having someone like that as Health and Human Services secretary.\"",
      "Claims around antidepressant use",
      "Earlier this year, Trump issued an executive order to study the use of several medications including antidepressants and antipsychotics.",
      "The order called for the formation of the \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission -- to be chaired by Kennedy -- with an aim to understand chronic diseases.",
      "Among the goals of the commission is to \"assess the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs.\"",
      "Dr. Joseph Saseen, associate dean for clinical affairs and a professor in the departments of clinical pharmacy and family medicine at the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Colorado, said there are plenty of studies and analyses in the medical literature looking at the prevalence of SSRIs.",
      "\"We have an overwhelming amount of information,\" he told ABC News. \"These medicines, particularly SSRIs, are the most frequently prescribed antidepressants for patients with major depressive disorder. There is a plethora of information evaluating efficacy in a broad range of patient populations for which these medicines are indicated.\"",
      "Saseen says these medications do have side effects, just like any drug, but the benefits significantly outweigh the risks for most people in the general population who have major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.",
      "Kennedy has also falsely linked the use of antidepressants to school shootings and claimed during his Senate confirmation hearings that members of his family had a harder time stopping SSRI use than heroin use.",
      "Experts have said there is no evidence that equates ending the use of antidepressants to ending the use of heroin or to suggest that people on SSRIs are more likely to be violent.",
      "Saseen said it's reasonable to question scientific research, either to reaffirm or dispute findings, but it must be done following the scientific method.",
      "\"Question it the real way, not the cowardly way,\" he said. \"The cowardly way is labeling things as threats or as bad without taking a scientific approach. The key is you need to use appropriate methodologies, not vocal inflections and very triggering and polarizing words to create an uprising.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:05:38 -0400",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump has utilized one of Project 2025's key tactics by overwhelming the courts and the public with constant policy changes, legal experts say.",
    "story": [
      "They say sweeping actions in his first 100 days will have long-term impact.",
      "On the campaign trail, and in the weeks leading up to his return to the White House, President Donald Trump vowed to hit the ground running -- what experts describe as a \"flood the zone\" strategy to push forward on his conservative and controversial policies.",
      "The pace has meant an often unprecedented first 100 days in office: \"Trump speed,\" the White House calls it.",
      "Earlier this month, he told Republican lawmakers at a party dinner: \"We're setting records right now. We're getting more things approved than any president has ever done in the first 100 days. It's not even close. I had somebody say the most successful month -- first month in the history. Now they said the most successful 100 days in the history of our country.\"",
      "How he's done so, legal experts told ABC News, will have a long-lasting impact on the presidency and the federal government.",
      "His main strategy has been to sign executive orders almost daily, including ones that challenge Congress' power to fund and oversee federal agencies and programs, while others relentlessly test the limits of immigration enforcement.",
      "Other presidents on both sides of the aisle have tried to flex their executive muscle, such as President Joe Biden's EO to require 50% of cars and light trucks sold to be zero-emission electric vehicles by 2030, according to Tabitha Bonilla, research assistant professor at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University.",
      "\"Every president over the last few decades have been trying to add more power to the executive branch and forward their agenda,\" Bonilla told ABC News. \"Trump is taking that to the extreme.\"",
      "As an example, experts cited Trump using legal and financial threats to punish universities and law firms for alleged political opposition and failure to \"align\" with his agenda, as well as his wholesale firings of top career officials, replacing them with loyalists.",
      "James Sample, a constitutional law expert at Hofstra University, said that Trump's playbook appears to be straight out of Project 2025, a blueprint for \"taking the reins of the federal government\" prepared for years by Trump's most conservative allies in anticipation of his comeback -- although Trump claimed to never have read it.",
      "Trump and his supporters said his actions are justified because unelected bureaucrats and judges, they claim, had seized control from presidents -- the one person elected nationwide, they argue, and granted total executive power by the Constitution.",
      "Regardless, Sample said, the tactic should raise a red flag.",
      "\"The purpose of a blitzkrieg is to overwhelm the opposition,\" he said.",
      "While Trump's tactics have been met with little to no protest from the Republican lawmakers who control the House and Senate, the judicial branch has often been ready to stem the flood through rulings and injunctions in dozens of court cases.",
      "Still, experts told ABC News, that even if all of Trump's moves are blocked or even reversed, they have done both serious short-term and long-term damage.",
      "\"It's all about implanting the narrative,\" Bonilla said. \"Trump's policies and rhetoric have pushed everything to the right and hurt our strength on the global scale.\"",
      "Floodgates opened",
      "Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, he has issued more than 140 executive orders on various policies as of Monday, shattering records and upending widely held interpretations of federal law and the Constitution.",
      "President Joe Biden, by comparison, issued 162 EOs in his entire term, and Trump issued more than 30 executive orders during the first 100 days of his first term, according to historical records.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Fox News in March that in this second term, the Trump team knew it needed to act fast, citing the midterm elections in November 2026 that could change the congressional map.",
      "\"This 18 months is our time frame. One hundred days, certainly six months into the year, and 18 months, are sort of our benchmarks,\" she said.",
      "The \"flood the zone\" goal has been long-touted by Trump's allies.",
      "His former White House political adviser Steve Bannon appeared to coin the idea during Trump's first term. After Trump left office, conservative activists and Trump loyalists crafted a proposed battle plan for a second term.",
      "In a 2023 speech, Russell Vought, a chief architect of Project 2025 and now Trump's current director of the Office of Management and Budget, laid out one strategy at his Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump Washington think tank.",
      "\"I want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected because they are increasingly viewed as villains. We want to put them in trauma,\" he said in a speech reported by ProPublica.",
      "Video of his making that speech was brought up during Vought's confirmation hearings earlier this year but he repeatedly avoiding answering questions about his provocative rhetoric and plans.",
      "Many of Trump's EOs have dealt with Elon Musk's brainchild -- the Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed agency budgets and tens of thousands of federal employees throughout the country, while others have pushed forward the president's crackdown on immigration, such as the end to birthright citizenship and deporting migrants as alleged foreign invaders under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Bernadette Meyler, the Carl and Sheila Spaeth professor of law at Stanford Law School, told ABC News that executive orders have always been a tool presidents have used to set their agenda, even if just symbolically.",
      "\"It is an effective tactic. It's difficult even for courts to react rapidly,\" Meyler said.",
      "Conservative groups have long advocated for a federal government shakeup and agued that the president needed more power to make the country more efficient.",
      "\"What he's doing is kickstarting what will ultimately be our legislative agenda,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in January after Trump's first round of executive orders.",
      "The Heritage Foundation, the far right think tank that helped to produce Project 2025, has contended that Trump's efforts are essential and fast action can make the government more efficient.",
      "Lindsey Burke, director of the Center for Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation, and Jonathan Butcher, a senior research fellow at the think tank, referenced this idea in a statement last month after Trump issued an executive order for a drastic reduction in force for the Department of Education.",
      "\"Reducing the bloated bureaucracy will give state and local education officials more decision-making authority,\" they said.",
      "War of words, resistance to courts",
      "Legal experts said another effective aspect of the \"flood the zone\" tactic was Trump's multiple media appearances and photo ops, where he continues to make controversial and provocative claims.",
      "Meyler contends Trump's war of words is part of a deeper tactic to undermine the public's trust in the federal government.",
      "She noted even with courts issuing injunctions, Trump's statements and resistance to judge's orders with aggressive appeals has still moved the needle more toward the right.",
      "\"It can seem he is doing a lot even without of lot of judicial action,\" Meyler said.",
      "How much steam is left?",
      "Trump and his allies have been adamant that they will stick to their plans to reassert the powers of the executive branch long after the first 100 days are up and are vowing to take all of their cases up to the Supreme Court if necessary.",
      "As of Sunday, there have been 217 court cases against the second Trump administration, according to an ABC News accounting, and a large majority of those have led to temporary restraining orders, reversals and, in some cases, full-on blocks of Trump's agenda.",
      "\"In the first Trump administration, we saw a lot of executive actions in the beginning and then saw it slow down,\" Bonilla said. \"We will be living in the space of a lot happening all at once for a while, but at some point, there is going to be a moment where there is so much that [the executive branch] can't keep up.\"",
      "Meyler agreed but added that Trump, the Project 2025 architects and their allies have stated that they are willing to work with Congress to get their agenda passed through legislative channels.",
      "\"That might secure his policies, and slow things down, and avoid the courts,\" she said.",
      "That pivot will meet more resistance, especially as we approach the midterms, according to Meyler.",
      "\"It's easier for some than others because of various practical matters, but there is a tipping point,\" she said. \"People are already protesting and Trump's public ratings are dipping.\"",
      "Still, future presidents will likely emulate the \"flood the zone\" tactic in their first weeks, according to Meyler.",
      "\"Over the long course of presidential history, there is rarely a retraction of presidential power,\" she said.",

      "A hundred days into his second term, President Donald Trump's seemingly unending torrent of executive actions has aimed to overhaul many facets of the federal government, push his cultural agenda and settle scores with those he sees as enemies.",
      "His second first 100 days in office have been vastly different from those of his first term. Unlike then, Trump is now surrounded by a team that understands how to mechanize government to satiate his desires to make himself in the image of the strongmen he expresses admiration for.",
      "Clawing back federal funding, revoking security clearances and visas, and testing the limits of court orders are all tools in this administration's arsenal. Trump himself continues to float legally questionable ideas like sending Americans to foreign prisons with the ominous promise that his team is \"looking into\" it and claiming \"there are methods\" to seek a third term for president.",
      "Though the economy and inflation were arguably the most important issues as Americans cast ballots in November to return Trump to the White House, his promises of economic grandeur have not materialized.",
      "The latest ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll found broad economic anxiety with 72% saying it's very or somewhat likely that Trump's economic policies will cause a recession in the short term. According to the same poll, 53% say the economy has gotten worse since Trump took office.",
      "Early in this second term, Trump has tried to bend institutions and even nations into submission -- from universities to law firms to trade partners and allies.",
      "\"I run the country and the world,\" Trump told The Atlantic.",
      "His action-packed first 100 days haven't delivered popularity for Trump. He has the lowest 100-day job approval rating of any president in the past 80 years, according to the same poll.",
      "Trump 2.0 is unburdened by political convention. Neither public opinion nor the concerns of Republican lawmakers nor a volatile market has spurred this administration to change course. For the Republican Party, particularly those in vulnerable congressional districts and battleground states, this is a political liability.",
      "Look no further than the hordes that turn up to town halls hosted by the few Republican lawmakers brave enough to host them. They are characterized by tense exchanges, audience ejections and, in one case, stun guns deployed to subdue two attendees. Republicans have largely dismissed concerns raised in these venues.",
      "Or look at special elections where Democrats won or outperformed expectations. Even some Republicans admit that momentum is on the side of Democrats and their anti-Trump (and Musk) message.",
      "Still, there are few Trump supporters who regret their choice. The question looking forward is if they'll turn out when he isn't atop the ticket.",
      "At the same time, the soul-searching underway on the Democratic side demonstrates an uncertainty about what messaging and who should come next.",
      "Our poll found that 69% of Americans say the Democratic Party is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the country while 60% say the same of Trump and 64% the same of the Republican Party.",
      "Some have interpreted November's losses as a call to make more concerted efforts to reach moderates and even those on the right.",
      "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has ingratiated himself with conservative figures via his podcast (a medium Trump and those in his orbit dominated in the run-up to November's elections). Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer made a point to say she understood Trump's motivation on tariffs and appeared with him in the Oval Office (though she hid behind a folder for a portion of her visit). Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan seemingly praised Ronald Reagan during her rebuttal to Trump's address to a joint session of Congress.",
      "Intraparty tensions have also been on display as the party tries to reinvent itself and as some Democratic voters have indicated they're looking for Democrats to fight harder against the Republican Party.",
      "Gun-reform activist David Hogg made the highly unusual move as vice chair of the Democratic Party to weigh in on primary races targeting incumbent Democrats he calls \"asleep at the wheel\" in hopes of forcing a party shift to a new generation of leadership through his group Leaders We Deserve. It's a move Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin decried.",
      "During recent remarks in New Hampshire, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, a potential 2028 contender, went after who he called \"do-nothing Democrats\" who he said \"blame our losses on our defense of Black people, of trans kids, of immigrants, instead of their own lack of guts and gumption.\"",
      "He also called for mass protests against the White House.",
      "\"These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace,\" Pritzker said. \"They have to understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have. We must castigate them on the soap box and then punish them at the ballot box.\"",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have doubled down on progressive values in their cross country \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour.",
      "It remains to be seen which faction of the Democratic Party will win out on strategy that could help recoup their losses looking ahead to midterm elections.",
      "While the first 100 days of the Trump presidency may prove to be a defining period for Trump and his presidency, the political future of both parties is still a moving target.",

      "The division was established in the wake of the 1950s Civil Rights movement.",
      "The Justice Department's division tasked with enforcing the nation's federal civil rights laws has recently seen a mass exodus of \"over 100\" attorneys, the newly confirmed official leading the division said in an interview this week.",
      "\"What we have made very clear last week in memos to each of the 11 sections in the Civil Rights Division is that our priorities under President Trump are going to be somewhat different than they were under President Biden,\" DOJ Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said in an interview with conservative host Glenn Beck. \"And then we tell them, these are the President's priorities, this is what we will be focusing on \u2014 you know, govern yourself accordingly. And en masse, dozens and now over 100 attorneys decided that they'd rather not do what their job requires them to do.\"",
      "The resignations come as Dhillon and Attorney General Pam Bondi have made clear the priorities of the division -- which was established in the wake of the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s -- would shift away from priorities like enforcing voting rights laws and cracking down on unconstitutional policing to culture war issues touted by President Trump in his 2024 campaign.",
      "In recent weeks, the department has said it would pursue legal action against states that permit transgender athletes to participate in girls' and women's sports, withdrawn from a Biden-era lawsuit against Georgia's voting laws and convened a task force to investigate incidents of \"anti-Christian bias.\"",
      "Of the recent resignations, Dhillon said in the interview that she thinks it's \"fine\" the attorneys opted to leave.",
      "\"We don't want people in the federal government who feel like it's their pet project to go persecute, you know, police departments based on statistical evidence or persecute people praying outside abortion facilities instead of doing violence,\" Dhillon said. \"That's not the job here. The job here is to enforce the federal civil rights laws, not woke ideology.\"",
      "At the same time, Dhillon said in the interview she was seeking to staff up the division so they could pursue issues like the administration's actions targeting Harvard University.",
      "\"You need more lawyers, investigators and commitment to do the work, and you need the people in the United States identifying these things for us,\" Dhillon said. \"We're going to run out of attorneys to work on these things at some point.\"",
      "Several top Democrats sent a letter to Bondi, Dhillon and DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz Monday raising concerns over what they described as the \"politicization\" of the DOJ's civil rights division.",

      "GOP hopes to reshape spending to align with the president\u2019s domestic agenda.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson met with President Donald Trump Monday afternoon in the Oval Office, where they huddled over the GOP's political strategy heading into a pivotal period of legislative business -- with their congressional majorities on the line.",
      "As Congress returns to Washington following a two-week recess and the president approaches 100 days in office, Republicans hope to sharply reshape federal spending to align with the president's domestic agenda.",
      "After meeting with the president, Johnson returned to the Capitol to meet with top administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and leading congressional Republicans grappling over budget reconciliation.",
      "\"We're working on the big, beautiful bill, the reconciliation bill,\" Johnson told reporters. \"Now is game time as the big developments will be coming together. We're excited about that. I think it's going to be a great piece of legislation.\"",
      "Flanked by White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett and James Blair, assistant to the president, Bessent told reporters after the meeting on Monday that he found \u201cgreat unity\u201d among congressional Republican leaders, with the House and Senate moving quickly and \"in lockstep\" on a budget bill focused on Trump\u2019s priorities.",
      "The meeting included Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Johnson, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith.",
      "\u201cWe think that they are in a substantial agreement, and that this is going to be a win for the American people. Very-pro growth,\u201d Bessent continued.",
      "He said there were \u201cthree legs\u201d to the president's economic agenda: trade, tax and deregulation. He said they hoped to get the tax portion of the budget package done by July 4.",
      "\u201cBoth sides have proposals in front of the President, and we think there's a path to deliver the requisite spending reforms to get a great pro-growth tax package, along with the president's priorities that he laid out on the campaign trail,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "Hassett reiterated Trump\u2019s claim that a billionaire tax cut is off the table. Bessent said priorities for the package would be to make tax cuts and the Jobs Act permanent, no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, and deductibility for loans for American-made cars.",
      "Asked if Bessent's July 4 timeline was realistic, Thune said, \"I think so. You know, I mean, it's, it all depends on how progress goes in the next few weeks.\"",
      "\"I think we, everybody, feels like we're making significant progress in trying to get the House, the Senate and the White House, kind of in the same place. But it's going to take time. It's complicated -- a lot of moving parts,\" Thune said.",
      "Republicans have begun releasing legislative text to codify their lofty ambitions to cut at least $2 trillion from federal spending over the next decade, with six markups scheduled this week and additional hearings anticipated in the coming weeks as conservatives face the latest test of their narrow majority.",
      "\"It's going to solve a lot of problems,\" Johnson predicted. \"It's going to be a turbo-boost for the economy, and we're looking forward to getting that done.\"",
      "But as Trump reaches his 100th day in office this week, polling shows the public souring on the president's job performance. Nevertheless, Johnson maintains the belief that the GOP is poised to defend its narrow majority -- claiming Republicans \"are playing offense.\"",
      "\"We talked about the upcoming races, the midterm elections and we're very bullish on it,\" Johnson proclaimed. \"There's 13 Democrats sitting in districts that President Trump won. Those are the obvious targets. We have an offensive map. There's only three House Republicans sitting in districts that Kamala Harris won. So it's a lopsided map, it gives us a great opportunity and we're going to go make history.\"",
      "Still, Johnson acknowledged there have been some ups and downs in the early stages of the administration.",
      "\"These presidential terms are roller-coaster sometimes. There's been a little tumult in the markets with the tariff policy and all of that, but I think this is settling out,\" Johnson said. \"People are in very good spirits. They understand that this is a long game to be played.\"",

    "story": [
      "Majorities of voters disapprove of many of Trump's policies, the poll found.",
      "Donald Trump has the lowest 100-day job approval rating of any president in the past 80 years, with public pushback on many of his policies and extensive economic discontent, including broad fears of a recession, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.",
      "Yet he still beats the Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems.",
      "Thirty-nine percent of respondents in this ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll said they approve of how Trump is handling his job as president, down 6 percentage points from February, while 55% said they disapprove.",
      "The previous low in approval for a president at or near 100 days in office, in polls dating to 1945, was Trump's 42% in 2017.",
      "Perhaps most threatening to Trump, given his promise of an economic turnaround, is the extent of negative views on the economy: Seventy-two percent said they think it's very or somewhat likely that his economic policies will cause a recession in the short term.",
      "Seventy-three percent said the economy is in bad shape, 53% said it's gotten worse since Trump took office and 41% said their own finances have worsened -- which is as many as those who said so under President Joe Biden last summer.",
      "Sixty-two percent said prices, which as a candidate, Trump pledged to curb, are rising. Seventy-one percent said they see his tariffs as a negative factor in price inflation. And just 31% in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, said they accept Trump's argument that the economy will emerge with a stronger foundation for the long term.",
      "Negative assessments go beyond the economy. Sixty-five percent said Trump's administration is trying to avoid complying with federal court orders, and 64% said he's going too far in trying to expand presidential powers.",
      "Sixty-two percent said they don't think his administration respects the rule of law.",
      "Majorities also expressed concern that the president will do too much to reduce the size and role of government (58%), argued he's acted beyond his authority as president without justification (56%) and doubted the Trump administration's commitment to protecting citizens' rights and freedoms (55%).",
      "See PDF for full results.",
      "Anywhere from 57% to 67% of Americans said they disapprove of Trump's performance on six of seven issues tested in this survey, including at least 6 in 10 on his handling of stock market volatility, tariffs, foreign relations and the economy overall.",
      "Fewer, 53%, said they disapprove of his handling of immigration.",
      "Six in 10 or more said they oppose various administration initiatives, peaking at 77% opposed to cuts in federal funding for medical research.",
      "Seventy percent were opposed to increasing the federal government's role in how private universities are run, 67% were opposed to ending birthright citizenship and 66% were opposed to closing the Department of Education.",
      "As reported Friday, opposition to deporting immigrants is lower, 51%. Additionally, on university governance, the public sided with Harvard University over the Trump administration in their dispute, 66%-32%.",
      "In another gauge, 57% said Trump is \"going too far\" in closing federal agencies, and it's about the same, 56%, in both laying off federal employees and in taking action against his political opponents.",
      "This eases to about half on ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, reflecting the public's divide on whether DEI efforts help level the playing field (51%) or create unfair discrimination (47%).",
      "In a positive for the president, more people said they believe waste throughout the federal government has decreased rather than increased under Trump, 43%-25%. The rest said it's stayed the same.",
      "That doesn't carry over in perceptions of fraud: Thirty-four percent said they think this has increased, while 32% said it has decreased.",
      "Another question, raised by Trump's comprehensive efforts to reshape the government, found that 49% think the president is moving the country away from its founding principles, while 34% think he's moving it closer toward them. Seventeen percent said they don't think he's moving it either way.",
      "Approval",
      "At 39%, Trump's job approval rating is down from 45% in a Washington Post/Ipsos poll in February. It now almost exactly matches his average, 40%, across his first term -- tied with Biden for the lowest presidential career average available, dating back to President Harry Truman.",
      "Notably, just 21% now said they \"strongly\" approve of Trump's work in office, his lowest percentage on record. About twice as many, 44%, said they strongly disapprove.",
      "Trump's approval rating from non-college-educated white men, a core support group, is 54%, tying his low in this group from his first term.",
      "That may reflect that 43% of non-college-educated white men said the nation's economy has worsened under Trump, and a third said they have gotten less well off financially since he's taken office.",
      "Trump is also tied with his previous lows in approval among Democrats and liberals.",
      "Still, Trump is hanging on to the vast bulk of his voters.",
      "Among people who voted for him in November, just 6% said they now regret it, while 94% said it was the right thing to do. (Buyer's regret was even lower, 2%, at this point in his first term, a 4-point swing.)",
      "In another gauge of partisanship, 83% of Republicans said they approve of Trump's work in office, while 93% of Democrats and 60% of independents said they disapprove.",
      "A difference is that 51% of Republicans strongly approve of Trump, while 85% of Democrats strongly disapprove. So do 44% of independents, three times as many as those who strongly approve.",
      "Trump's ratings on individual issues, absent immigration, are also underwater.",
      "Sixty-seven percent said they disapprove of his handling of the recent turmoil in the stock market.",
      "The S&P 500 is down 8.7% since Trump took office.",
      "On tariffs, 64% said they disapprove; on both the economy overall and U.S. relations with other countries, 61% said they disapprove; on looking out for the interests of average Americans, 58% said they disapprove; and on managing the federal government, 57% said they disapprove.",
      "The opposition",
      "The silver lining for Trump is that the opposition party remains out of favor.",
      "People said they trust him over the Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems by 37%-30%. Underscoring bipartisan disaffection, 30% said they don't trust either party.",
      "Further, while 60% said Trump is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the country, even more, 69%, said the Democratic Party is out of touch. It's 64% for the Republican Party overall.",
      "There are some telling partisan gaps.",
      "In the political middle, 62% of independents said Trump is out of touch, while substantially more, 76%, said the Democratic Party is out of touch. And in their own camps, relatively few Republicans said Trump is out of touch, 19%, while twice as many Democrats, 38%, said this about their own party.",
      "At the same time, more people said both parties should be doing more to oppose Trump rather than more to support him -- the Democratic Party by 46%-38% and the Republican Party by 50%-26%, with the rest saying each party is handling this about right.",
      "In both cases, independents help tip the balance to opposing versus supporting Trump.",
      "Courts and Compliance",
      "In terms of the legal battles over Trump's moves, people widely rejected the administration's accusations of improper judicial interference.",
      "Most, 62%-35%, said federal judges are trying to enforce existing limits on Trump's legal authority rather than trying to interfere with his authority.",
      "An even wider margin of people, 67%-31%, said federal judges should have the authority to block an administration policy until a trial is held if they think it will harm people and is probably illegal.",
      "Further, people said by a margin of 67%-31% that they think the Trump administration is trying to avoid complying with court orders regarding its activities rather than trying to comply with those orders.",
      "Cutting government",
      "Majority perceptions of presidential overreach are common.",
      "As mentioned, 58% said they express concern that Trump will do too much to reduce the size and role of the federal government. That's essentially a mirror of attitudes under Biden: Fifty-nine percent said they were concerned he'd do too much to increase the government's size and role.",
      "The difference is in partisan divisions, reflecting sharply different views of government between Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents on one hand and Republicans and Republican-leaning independents on the other.",
      "In the Democratic group, 91% said they are concerned Trump will do too much to shrink the size and role of government, while 26% in the Republican group said the same.",
      "In 2021, by contrast, 87% in the GOP camp said they were concerned that Biden would go too far to increase the government's size and role, while 31% in the Democratic group said so.",
      "Views on the Trump administration cutting federal regulations are more closely divided.",
      "Fifty-two percent said they think it will cut regulations that are needed to protect public health and safety, while 46% instead said they think it will cut unnecessary regulations while keeping those that are needed.",
      "Foreign relations and Russia",
      "In the last area covered by this survey, respondents by 49%-34% said they think Trump has weakened rather than strengthened U.S. leadership in the world.",
      "While still negative, that's better than Biden's 48%-23% result on the same question in 2022.",
      "Regarding Russia, 46% said Trump's approach is too friendly, while 11% said it's too confrontational and 40% said it's about right. That's similar to what it was in a January 2017 poll.",
      "This survey was completed before the administration's move in the past week, pressuring Ukraine to accept a ceasefire deal favorable to Russia.",
      "Methodology: This ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae April 18-22, 2025, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,464 adults. Partisan divisions are 30%-30%-29%, Democrats-Republicans-independents.",
      "Results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, including the design effect. Error margins are larger for subgroups. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.",
      "The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates, with sampling and data collection by Ipsos.",

      "Former Memphis police officer Desmond Mills Jr. has testified that he regrets his failure to stop the beating of Tyre Nichols after Nichols ran away from a traffic stop in 2023",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Former Memphis police officer Desmond Mills Jr. testified Tuesday that he regrets his failure to stop the beating of Tyre Nichols after Nichols ran away from a traffic stop in 2023.",
      "Mills' testimony came in the second day of the trial of Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, who have pleaded not guilty to state charges including second-degree murder in the death of Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was beaten as he cried out for his mother just steps from his home. The three defendants already face the prospect of years behind bars after they were convicted of federal charges last year.",
      "Footage of the beating was captured by a police pole camera and also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled. Nichols' death led to national protests, raised the volume on calls for police reforms in the U.S. and directed intense scrutiny toward the police force in Memphis, a majority-Black city.",
      "Mills pleaded guilty to federal charges last year and has entered into an agreement to plead guilty to state charges as well.",
      "During his testimony Tuesday, Mills said he and Bean responded to a Jan. 7, 2023, police radio call that a man had run away from a traffic stop after he was pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. Nichols saw the two officers and ran away from them, and Bean eventually caught Nichols after a foot chase, Mills testified.",
      "When Mills arrived at Nichols\u2019 location, Nichols was struggling with Bean and Smith, who were holding Nichols on the ground, Mills said. Mills then tried to pepper-spray Nichols, but he ended up spraying himself, which made him angry, Mills said.",
      "After stepping away to try to recover, Mills then walked up to Nichols and hit him three times in the arm with a police baton as Bean and Smith were holding Nichols, Mills said.",
      "Mills told prosecutor Paul Hagerman that he hit Nichols with the baton because he was angry. Another officer, Emmitt Martin, arrived and punched and kicked Nichols in the head.",
      "Nichols died three days after the beating. Mills acknowledged on the stand that he had a duty to intervene to stop it, but didn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cDo you regret that?\u201d the prosecutor said.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d Mills said.",
      "Mills also acknowledged that he did not tell paramedics that Nichols had been repeatedly hit in the head and later failed to give police supervisors details of the beating because he didn\u2019t want to get in trouble.",
      "Under the plea agreements, Mills\u2019 state sentence will be the same length as his federal term, which could reach up to life in prison, though federal prosecutors have recommended a 15-year sentence. He would serve the state sentence at the same time as his federal term in prison.",
      "In opening statements Monday, prosecutor Paul Hagerman said Nichols was being held by his arms by two of the officers as he was punched and kicked and hit with a police baton.",
      "Hagerman said the officers helped each other beat Nichols to death. An autopsy showed Nichols died three days after the beating of blunt force trauma.",
      "He said the officers had a duty to stop the beating but none of them did so. They were \u201covercome by the moment,\u201d the prosecutor said.",
      "In his opening statement, Bean\u2019s attorney said the situation became \u201chigh risk\u201d when Nichols continued driving for about 2 miles (3.2 km) after one of the officers turned on his vehicle\u2019s blue lights in an attempt to stop Nichols for speeding. Nichols then failed to follow orders to give officers his hands so that he could be handcuffed, Perry said.",
      "\u201cHe was actually resisting arrest the whole time,\u201d Perry said, adding that the officers just \u201cwanted to do their job effectively.\u201d",
      "Both Smith and Haley called for medical aid the night of the beating, their lawyers said.",
      "The jury for the state trial was chosen in Hamilton County, which includes Chattanooga, after Judge James Jones Jr. ordered the case be heard from people outside of Shelby County, which includes Memphis.

      "The five officers were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit that has since been disbanded. The team targeted drugs, illegal guns and violent offenders with the goal of amassing arrests, while sometimes using force against unarmed people.",

      "A former high school athletics director accused of using artificial intelligence to create a racist and antisemitic deepfake of a Maryland principal has been sentenced to four months in jail as part of a plea deal for disturbing school operations",
      "BALTIMORE -- A former high school athletics director accused of using artificial intelligence to create a racist and antisemitic deepfake of a Maryland principal has been sentenced to four months in jail as part of a plea deal for disrupting school operations.",
      "Dazhon Darien, 32, accepted the deal Monday in Baltimore County Circuit Court, records show. He entered an Alford plea to the single misdemeanor charge, which means he acknowledged the evidence against him without directly admitting guilt. His original charges included theft, stalking and retaliating against a witness.",
      "According to police and prosecutors, Darien used AI software to generate a fake recording of former Pikesville High School principal Eric Eiswert\u2019s voice expressing frustration with Black students and their test-taking abilities. The recording, which was disseminated throughout the school community and shared widely on social media last January, also purported to capture the principal disparaging Jewish people, authorities said.",
      "Not long before the recording surfaced, Eiswert had informed Darien that his contract wouldn\u2019t be renewed the following semester because of concerns over poor job performance, according to court documents. The concerns included allegations that Darien paid his roommate $1,900 in school funds under the pretense of coaching the girls\u2019 soccer team, police said.",
      "Experts who analyzed the recording concluded it was AI-generated.",
      "Despite receiving a relatively short sentence, Darien could remain incarcerated longer as he faces a separate federal case in which he\u2019s accused of sexual exploitation of children and possession of child sexual abuse material. Authorities said they discovered evidence of those crimes while searching Darien\u2019s phone and other devices.",
      "While fake recordings of political figures and celebrities have surfaced in recent years as the technology becomes more widespread, officials have said the case is among the first examples of AI being used to embarrass someone for personal gain.",
      "The subset of artificial intelligence known as generative AI can create hyperrealistic images, videos and audio clips. As it becomes cheaper and easier to use, anyone with an internet connection can access its capabilities. Even a short recording of someone\u2019s voice allows users to generate cloned speech from a script.",
      "Other examples of AI-generated audio include robocalls impersonating former President Joe Biden that tried to dissuade Democrats from voting in last year\u2019s New Hampshire primary election. People have also cloned the voices of purportedly kidnapped children over the phone to get ransom money from parents, experts say.",
      "In response, many states have enacted laws in recent years targeting the use of AI, especially targeting media intended to influence election results and digitally created or altered child sexual abuse imagery.",
      "During this year\u2019s legislative session, Maryland lawmakers considered a bill that would have prohibited the use of AI to falsely impersonate people. Baltimore County State\u2019s Attorney Scott Shellenberger advocated in favor of the law change, but it ultimately didn\u2019t pass.",
      "Darien\u2019s bogus audio sent shockwaves through the suburban Pikesville community as angry phone calls inundated the school and hate-filled messages accumulated on social media. Authorities said police were sent to patrol Eiswert\u2019s home in response to threats.",
      "Eiswert, who is now principal of another Baltimore County school, said from the beginning that he believed the recording was fake. He has since filed a lawsuit against the school district, alleging Darien never should have been hired in the first place.",
      "Darien joined the district in spring 2023, when he started teaching social studies at a different high school, according to the lawsuit. He was later promoted to Pikesville athletic director.",
      "Eiswert\u2019s complaint cites reporting from The Baltimore Banner that revealed a host of false claims on Darien\u2019s job application, including multiple degrees he hadn\u2019t obtained. Florida education officials also denied Darien a teaching certificate in 2016 based on \u201ctest of document fraud\u201d and flagged his name in a national database, the Banner found. Eiswert argues Baltimore County school officials failed to properly vet his application materials and investigate his background.",

      "President Donald Trump is pushing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to cede territory occupied by Russia to Moscow to bring about an end to the fighting in Ukraine",
      "LONDON -- President Donald Trump is pushing Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the war, threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult \u2014 and causing alarm bells in Europe about how to fill the gap.",
      "Ukraine's European allies view the war as fundamental to the continent's security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily \u2014 regardless of whether Trump pulls out.",
      "Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of prolonging the \u201ckilling field\u201d by pushing back on his demand that Ukraine hand over occupied Crimea to Moscow.",
      "Trump\u2019s land-for-peace plan would mark a significant shift in the post-World War II order, ripping up conventions that have long held that borders should not be redrawn by force.",
      "\u201cIt took a World War to roll back de jure annexations and 60 million people died,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, referring to the pre-war annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany.",
      "\u201cEuropeans will not accept it\" and Ukraine will not either, he said.",
      "Diplomats and experts described various scenarios if the U.S. decides to walk. They range from the U.S. ceasing direct aid to Ukraine \u2014 but allowing European nations to pass on critical American intelligence and weapons to Kyiv \u2014 to Trump banning transfers of any American technology, including components or software in European weapons.",
      "Any withdrawal of U.S. military aid to Ukraine could create serious difficulties for Europe, analysts and diplomats told The Associated Press. Kyiv's ability to keep fighting would depend on European political will to muster money and weapons \u2014 and how quickly the gaps left by Washington can be filled.",
      "If it were easy, Europe would \u201calready be doing things without America,\u201d said a European diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.",
      "No new U.S. aid package for Ukraine has been approved since Trump came into office, even as European nations have collectively provided Ukraine with more aid than Washington, according to the Keil Institute.",
      "Europe has contributed around $157 billion, some $26 billion more than the U.S., although Washington slightly outpaces Europe when it comes to military aid, the Germany-based institute said.",
      "It will be hard, but there are ways Europe can find cash to fund Ukraine \u2014 including seizing frozen Russian assets \u2014 but \u201cmoney isn't what you shoot bullets with,\u201d Heisbourg said.",
      "Europe\u2019s \"big mistake\" was undertaking major military downsizing following the Cold War and thinking \u201cthis war started in February 2022 and not in February 2014,\u201d when Moscow invaded and then annexed Crimea, said Thomas Gomart, director of IFRI, a French international affairs think tank.",
      "Europeans are scrambling to acquire weapons for themselves and for Ukraine, while confronting constraints on production capacity, a fragmented defense industry and a decades-long reliance on the U.S.",
      "Some extra production capacity could come from Ukraine, which has ramped up manufacturing of ammunition and drones since Russia's invasion. Much harder to replace, experts said, are advanced American weapons, including air defenses.",
      "Russia has attacked Ukraine almost nightly since Putin\u2019s forces invaded in February 2022, flooding the skies with missiles and drones, including dummy attack drones to exhaust Ukraine's limited air defenses. In April, at least 57 people were killed in multiple strikes.",
      "The death toll from the Russian attacks would \u201cinevitably\u201d be higher without the American Patriot air-defense missile systems protecting Ukraine's skies, said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "The Patriots can track and intercept Russian missiles, including the hypersonic Kinzhal, which Putin has boasted was unstoppable. Kyiv uses them to protect critical infrastructure, including the country's energy grid.",
      "Earlier this month, Zelenskyy asked to buy 10 Patriots, a request Trump dismissed. \u201cYou don\u2019t start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" he said, a day after a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy killed 35 people.",
      "France and Italy have given Ukraine their Aster SAMP/T air-defense system but the issue is not \u201cquality, it\u2019s quantity,\u201d Barrie said, pointing to the larger U.S. defense industrial base and greater U.S. stockpiles.",
      "Although Trump criticized Putin over the weekend for his missile strikes and suggested imposing more sanctions on Russia, for Europe it remains a wait-and-see game.",
      "The whiplash of Trump's aggressive foreign policy means nothing is off the cards, experts said.",
      "A worst-case scenario could see a ban on American weapons exports and transfers to Ukraine, which would bar European nations from buying U.S. weapons to give to Kyiv or transferring weapons with American components or software, Barrie said.",
      "That could mean countries, including Germany, that have already given American Patriots to Ukraine would be prohibited from doing so. Such a move would seriously hamper Europe's ability to support Kyiv and mark a fundamental shift in America's relationship with its allies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the U.S. to cease to be an ally, it is another for the U.S. to be an enemy,\u201d Heisbourg said, noting that such a step could also damage the U.S. defense sector if weapons purchases were perceived to be unusable on Trump\u2019s political order.",
      "In March, the Trump administration suspended intelligence sharing with Ukraine in a bid to force Zelenskyy to accept a truce with Russia. The about weeklong suspension impacted Ukraine's ability to track and target Russian troops, tanks and ships.",
      "There are certain capabilities, including \u201chigher-end\u201d surveillance and reconnaissance using satellites that \u201conly the United States can provide,\u201d said Matthew Kroenig, vice president of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security in Washington.",
      "While the extent of intelligence sharing between the U.S. and Ukraine is not known, experts said it likely shows Kyiv near real-time buildup of Russian troop deployments and helps target long-range strikes.",
      "Ukraine's allies do not have as much satellite capability as the U.S. but could launch more, or Ukraine could use commercial systems if Trump cuts off intelligence again, experts said. The latter would likely have to come from a European provider \u2014 in March, the American satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies confirmed it temporarily suspended access to unclassified satellite images following the administration's decision to pull intelligence sharing.",
      "Ukraine also needs an alternative to Elon Musk's satellite network Starlink, which is critical for Ukrainian defensive and civilian communications. European defense companies are discussing creating a satellite alliance but don't currently have an alternative on the same scale.",
      "If Trump walks away, or if Kyiv rejects a deal and keeps fighting with European support, it won\u2019t necessarily mean \"the collapse of Ukraine\" although more people will almost certainly die if the U.S. pulls its air defenses and intelligence-sharing capabilities, Heisbourg said.",
      "Trump has jolted European leaders into awareness that they need to take responsibility for their own defense, regardless of who occupies the White House, experts said.",
      "That means European nations need to invest more in defense, work together to scale up military production and build trust to share intelligence.",
      "\u201cThis issue is not a question about the next two months or the next two years. This issue is about the next two decades,\u201d Gomart said.",

      "Hochul, a Democrat, did not immediately detail plans for the ban. Her office has previously said that schools would have some flexibility over how to implement it, with districts deciding how to store students\u2019 devices during the school day. There would be exemptions for students who need access for medical reasons, to help with learning disabilities or because they don\u2019t speak fluent English, she has said.",
      "If approved, New York would join at least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 that have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools. Nationally, most schools say they prohibit cellphone use except for academic purposes, but educators say the rules are difficult to enforce when students are allowed to have the devices in hallways and at lunch.",
      "\u201cBell-to-bell\u201d bans like the one Hochul described are meant to remove the distraction altogether by restricting access during school hours, often over the objection of parents who say they want to be able to reach their kids during emergency situations.",

      "WARETOWN, N.J. -- Three-fourths of a vast wildfire in New Jersey's Pine Barrens has been contained, state officials said Monday.",
      "The state Forest Fire Service said the blaze in southern New Jersey's Ocean County had grown to nearly 24 square miles (62 square kilometers) but was 75% contained. No deaths or injuries have been reported, though several buildings and vehicles have been destroyed officials said.",
      "A 19-year-old man from Waretown is charged with arson. Prosecutors say Joseph Kling set wood pallets on fire and left the area before putting them out, sparking what became the state's second-largest fire in nearly two decades.",
      "The Office of the Public Defender, representing King, said he's \u201cpresumed innocent until proven otherwise in a court of law.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s forest fire season in the vast pine wilderness that covers more than 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) \u2014 an area roughly as large as the Grand Canyon \u2014 and firefighters are contending with low humidity and the aftermath of a monthslong drought. The Pine Barrens sit between Philadelphia and the Atlantic coast, a region with quick-draining sandy soil and trees with still-developing leaves where winds can kick up, drying out the forest floor.",
      "The fire service said the smoke is expected to linger until the next significant rainfall.",

      "Willie Cory Godbolt had filed a handwritten petition in August seeking the high court's review of a decision by the Mississippi Supreme Court affirming his convictions and death sentences.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency says consumers across the U.S. will still be able to buy cheaper E15 gasoline this summer",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Consumers across the U.S. still will be able to buy higher-ethanol blend E15 gasoline this summer, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday, saving them a little money at the pump but risking potential damage to the air and water.",
      "The emergency waiver issued by the EPA prevents retailers in most states from having to stop selling E15 gasoline on May 1. While the waiver remains in effect only through May 20, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signaled that he plans to keep issuing waivers through Sept. 15, the date when the federal government typically would allow E15 sales in all states again.",
      "Most gasoline sold across the U.S. is blended with 10% ethanol, but 15% blends are becoming increasingly common, particularly in the Midwest, where most of the nation's corn is grown. E15 gasoline generally costs at least 10 cents less a gallon than E10 gasoline, but the EPA had previously prohibited its sale during the summer over concerns that its use during the summer driving season could increase smog.",
      "But the EPA has relaxed restrictions on E15, granting a series of short-term waivers in 2022, 2023 and 2024 to allow its sale nationwide through the summer. And last year, the EPA issued a rule allowing year-round sales in eight Midwestern states \u2014 Iowa, usually the nation's top corn producer, as well as Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump administration officials said Monday's action will lower consumers' costs and give them more choices at the pump while also increasing the demand for corn. They also described it as reducing America's reliance on imported energy.",
      "\u201cOur nation\u2019s great corn growers are critical to helping the U.S. achieve energy independence, which is essential to national security,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement.",
      "While the ethanol industry and Iowa officials praised the EPA's action, the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group for ethanol producers, argued that Congress should approve legislation allowing year-round E15 sales across the U.S.",
      "\u201cFor the economic and energy security benefits of E15 to be fully realized, the marketplace needs long-term certainty,\u201d President and CEO Geoff Cooper said.",
      "The biofuels industry and politicians in both major parties argue that ethanol helps farmers, lowers prices at the pump and reduces greenhouse gas because the fuel burns more cleanly than straight gasoline.",
      "But ethanol consumes about 40% of the nation's corn crop, and environmentalists argue that higher corn production leads to higher use of fertilizers that are a leading source of water pollution.",
      "Zack Pistora, Kansas lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said ethanol plants also use high amounts of water, and states like Kansas are worried about the depletion of aquifers. He said it's \u201chypocritical\u201d to portray ethanol as environmentally friendly and said the Trump administration should promote renewable energy, electric vehicles, public transportation and sustainable agriculture.",
      "\u201cWe need to dramatically reduce our fossil fuel dependence, but relying on corn-based ethanol doesn\u2019t put our country on the path it needs,\u201d Pistora said in an interview.",

      "A historic Black church in downtown Memphis that was the organizing point for Martin Luther King Jr.'s final stand has suffered a devastating fire",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A historic Black church in downtown Memphis that was the organizing point for Martin Luther King Jr.'s final campaign in 1968 caught fire early Monday morning and suffered significant damage.",
      "\u201cThe inside is a total loss, but we're still somewhat hopeful that some of the facade will be able to be left standing,\u201d Memphis Fire Chief Gina Sweat said at a Monday morning news conference. She said the fire was reported at 1:39 a.m. through a commercial alarm service. Local fire and police officers are investigating the cause, along with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It is \u201cway too early\u201d to know anything more, Sweat said. King was drawn to Memphis in 1968 to support some 1,300 predominantly Black sanitation workers who went on strike to protest inhumane treatment. Two workers had been crushed in a garbage compactor in 1964, but the faulty equipment had not been replaced. On Feb. 1, 1968, two more men, Echol Cole, 36, and Robert Walker, 30, were crushed in the compactor. The two men were contract workers, so they did not qualify for workmen\u2019s compensation, and had no life insurance.",
      "Workers wanted to unionize, and fought for higher pay and safer working conditions. City officials declared the strike illegal and arrested scores of strikers and protesters.",
      "Before the fire, the Clayborn Temple was undergoing a $25 million restoration that was slated for completion in 2026. The initiative aims to preserve the architectural and historical integrity of the Romanesque revival church and includes the restoration of a 3,000-pipe grand organ. At the same time, the project seeks to help revitalize the local neighborhood with a museum, cultural programing and community outreach, according to a news release on the renovation.",
      "\u201cThis morning we woke up to heartbreaking news: a devastating fire has ravaged one of our city\u2019s greatest treasures, Clayborn Temple,\u201d Memphis Mayor Paul Young wrote in a statement posted to social media. \u201cClayborn is more than a historic building. It is sacred ground. It is the beating heart of the civil rights movement, a symbol of struggle, hope, and triumph that belongs not just to Memphis but to the world.\u201d",
      "Just south of Beale Street, Clayborn Temple was built in 1892 as the Second Presbyterian Church and originally served an all-white congregation. In 1949, the building was sold to an African Methodist Episcopal congregation and renamed Clayborn Temple, according to the release.",
      "Memphis sanitation workers started striking in February 1968 after Cole and Walker were killed on the job.",
      "The Clayborn Temple hosted nightly meetings and the campaign\u2019s iconic \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d posters were made in its basement. The temple was also a staging point for marches to City Hall. They included a March 28, 1968, march led by King, a rally that turned violent when police and protesters clashed on the iconic Beale Street, and a 16-year-old was killed.",
      "When marchers retreated to the temple, police fired tear gas inside. People broke some of the stained-glass windows to escape. King promised to lead a second, peaceful march in Memphis, but he was killed by a sniper while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel on April 4.",
      "After King was assassinated and the strike ended with the workers securing a pay raise, the church\u2019s influence waned. It fell into disrepair and was vacant for years before the renovation effort that took off in 2017 thanks to a $400,000 grant from the National Park Service.",
      "Clayborn Temple was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.",
      "Jimmie Tucker, one of the architects who has been working on the restoration for years, said Monday that he spent the morning working on a plan to try to shore up the exterior walls. He had been speaking to some of the people who helped after a similar Memphis fire at First United Methodist Church in 2006. He said that project gives him hope because they were able to rebuild.",
      "\u201cAs a native Memphian, this project is personal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has so much meaning.\u201d",
      "Young pledged that the city will \u201chelp ensure this sacred place rises again.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Wis. -- Prosecutors have reduced a felony misconduct charge against a former Wisconsin prison warden implicated in two inmate deaths to a misdemeanor as part of a plea deal, online court records indicated Monday.",
      "Hepp was charged with felony misconduct in office in June 2024 in the deaths of Cameron Williams and Donald Maier at the Waupun Correctional Institution, the state's oldest maximum security facility. He announced his retirement days before he was charged.",
      "Online court records show prosecutors reduced the misconduct charge Monday to violating state-county institution laws. The misconduct charge carried a maximum sentence of three-and-a-half years in prison and $10,000 in fines. The violation count is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and $500 in fines.",
      "Hepp was due to appear in Dodge County Circuit Court on Monday afternoon for a joint plea-sentencing hearing. Online records show a plea agreement was filed Monday morning and Hepp was given a guilty plea questionnaire, a form that asks defendants if they knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty.",
      "Hepp's attorney, Michael Steinle, did not return a message from The Associated Press on Monday morning.",
      "Eight members of Hepp's staff were charged in June with abuse or misconduct in the deaths. Online court records show charges were dismissed against one of them this month and another pleaded guilty in September to a reduced count of misdemeanor violating laws governing a penal institution and was assessed a $250 fine. Cases are pending against the remaining six staffers.",
      "Williams died of a stroke at the prison in October 2023. His body was not discovered for at least 12 hours. Maier died of dehydration and malnutrition in February 2024.",
      "According to court documents, Williams told an inmate advocate three days before he died that he needed to go to a hospital but no action was taken. He had fallen in the shower two days earlier and had to crawl into his cell. A day before that he collapsed on the way back to his cell but neither fall was documented. No one checked on him the night he died.",
      "Maier had severe mental health problems but either refused or wasn't given his medication in the eight days leading up to his death, according to court documents. Another inmate told investigators guards turned off Maier's water after he flooded his cell. Guards said they turned water off and on for Maier, but investigators said no one told him when it was on and no one gave him food in the four days before his death.",
      "Asked if prison workers understand the water shut-off policy, Hepp told investigators that policies go out via email but he doesn't think anyone at any prison reads them. He said no American jail documents an inmate's every meal.",
      "The prison, with a stone exterior and high, castle-like guard towers, opened in 1854 and has long been a target for closure. Seven inmates, including Williams and Maier, have died there since 2023. One killed himself, one died of a fentanyl overdose and one died of what investigators suspect was suicide. Two more deaths are under investigation.",
      "A federal investigation into smuggling at the prison has so far netted at least one former employee who pleaded guilty to smuggling cellphones and drugs in exchange for money. Inmates have filed a class-action lawsuit alleging inhumane conditions and a lack of health care.",
      "Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has rejected calls to shutter the facility, despite the problems. He has said he wants broader criminal justice reform and a plan to house the facility's roughly 1,700 inmates.",

      "Schoolchildren threatened with eviction are more likely to end up in another district or transfer to another school",
      "HOUSTON -- Since her birth 10 years ago, Mackenzie Holmes has rarely called one place home for long.",
      "There was the house in Houston owned by her grandmother, Crystal Holmes. Then, after Holmes lost her Southwest Airlines job and the house, there was the trio of apartments in the suburbs \u2014 and three evictions. Then another rental, and another eviction. Then motels and her uncle's one-bedroom apartment, where Mackenzie and her grandmother slept on an inflatable mattress. Finally, Crystal Holmes secured a spot in a women's shelter, so the two would no longer have to sleep on the floor.",
      "With nearly every move came a new school, a new set of classmates, and new lessons to catch up on. Mackenzie only has one friend she\u2019s known longer than a year, and she didn't receive testing or a diagnosis for dyslexia until this year. She would often miss long stretches of class in between schools.",
      "Schoolchildren threatened with eviction are more likely to end up in another district or transfer to another school, often one with less funding, more poverty and lower test scores. They're more likely to miss school, and those who end up transferring are suspended more often. That's according to an analysis from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, published in Sociology of Education, a peer-reviewed journal, and shared exclusively with The Associated Press' Education Reporting Network.",
      "Pairing court filings and student records from the Houston Independent School District, where Mackenzie started kindergarten, researchers identified more than 18,000 times between 2002 and 2016 when students lived in homes threatened with eviction filings. They found students facing eviction were absent more often. Even when they didn\u2019t have to change schools, students threatened with eviction missed four more days in the following school year than their peers.",
      "In all, researchers counted 13,197 children between 2002 and 2016 whose parents faced an eviction filing. A quarter of those children faced repeated evictions.",
      "As eviction rates in Houston continue to worsen, there might be more children like Mackenzie.",
      "Neveah Barahona, a 17-year-old big sister to seven siblings, started kindergarten in Houston, but has moved schools half a dozen times. Her mother, Roxanne Abarca, knew moving can be disruptive. So whenever she fell behind on rent and the family was forced to move, she tried to let them finish the school year \u2013 even if it meant driving them great distances.",
      "Neveah, a strong student who hopes to join the military, said the moves took a toll.",
      "\u201cIt is kind of draining, meeting new people, meeting new teachers, getting on track with ... what they want to teach you and what you used to know,\u201d Neveah said. Then there's finding her way with new classmates. A spate of bullying this year left her despondent until she got counseling.",
      "Households with children are about twice as likely to face eviction than those without children, Eviction Lab research has shown. That's 1.5 million children getting evicted every year \u2014 and one in 20 children under 5 living in a rental home. Still, much of the discourse focuses on adults \u2014 the landlords and grown-up tenants \u2014 rather than the kids caught in the middle, said Peter Hepburn, the study's lead author.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 worth reminding people that 40% of the people at risk of losing their homes through the eviction process are kids,\u201d said Hepburn, a sociology professor at Rutgers University-Newark and associate director at the Eviction Lab.",
      "Households often become more vulnerable to eviction because they fall behind when they have children. Only 5% of low-wage earners, who are especially vulnerable to housing instability, have access to paid parental leave.",
      "Under a federal law that protects homeless students, districts are supposed to try to keep children in the same school if they lose their housing midyear, providing daily transportation. But children who are evicted don't always qualify for those services. Even those who do often fall through the cracks, because schools don't know why children are leaving or where they're headed.",
      "In the sprawl of Houston, it can be especially challenging for transient students to stay on track. The metropolis bleeds seamlessly from the city limits to unincorporated parts of Harris County, which is divided into 24 other districts. It\u2019s easy to leave Houston's school district without realizing it. And despite the best efforts of parents and caretakers, kids can miss a lot of school in transition.",
      "That's what happened in January, when Mackenzie's grandmother, then staying in her son's one-bedroom apartment with her granddaughter, got desperate. Fearful her son would get evicted for having family stay with him, Crystal Holmes \u2014 who had no home, no car and no cell phone service \u2014 walked miles to a women's shelter.",
      "The shelter, where she and Mackenzie now share a room, is in another district's enrollment zone. She worried about Mackenzie being forced to move schools again \u2014 the fifth grader had already missed the first three weeks of the school year, when her grandmother struggled to get her enrolled.",
      "Thankfully, the federal law kicked in, and Mackenzie's school, Thornwood Elementary, now sends a car to fetch her and other students from the shelter.",
      "Houston Independent School District did not respond to interview requests.",
      "Millicent Brown lives in a public housing project in Houston, alongside an elevated highway so noisy she had to buy a louder doorbell. She and her daughter, Nova, 5, were forced to move last year when Nova\u2019s father threatened to hurt Brown.",
      "Nova had attended a charter school. But when she moved, the school said it could only bus Nova from her new home if she waited on a street that Brown said was too dangerous. Instead, Nova missed a month of school before enrolling in a nearby public school.",
      "Brown grew up bouncing between schools and wants better for Nova. But she may have to move again: The state has plans to widen the highway. It would wipe out her housing project \u2014 and Nova's new school.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Neveah and her family settled into a ranch-style home down a country road in Aldine. It's brightly lit, with four bedrooms and a renovated kitchen. Neaveah adopted a neighborhood cat named she named Bella. Her sister Aaliyah painted a portrait of the home that's displayed in the living room.",

      "A former supervisor of the team that prosecuted the 1,500 plus people charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol says he fears President Donald Trump's pardons could embolden right-wing extremists and encourage future political violence",
      "WASHINGTON -- Michael Romano spent more than 17 years at the Justice Department, eventually becoming a supervisor on the team that would prosecute more than 1,500 people charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The moment he watched the largest investigation in department history get wiped away with the stroke of a pen \u2014 on President Donald Trump's first day back in the White House \u2014 Romano knew he had to leave.",
      "\u201cI knew on January 20th, when the pardons were announced, that I needed to find my way out,\" Romano said in an interview with The Associated Press weeks after his resignation from the Justice Department. \u201cIt would be untenable for me to stay, given the pardons and given the false narratives that were being spread about January 6.\"",
      "Now, Romano says he fears Trump\u2019s decision to pardon even the most violent rioters \u2014 whom his own vice president once said \u201cobviously\u201d shouldn\u2019t be pardoned \u2014 could embolden right-wing extremists and encourage future political violence.",
      "\u201cThe way that the pardons have been received by the January 6th defendants and by other right-wing extremists, as I understand it, is to recognize that if you support the president and if you commit violence in support of the president, that he might insulate you from the consequences, that he might protect you from the criminal justice system,\u201d Romano said. \u201cAnd so that might encourage people to commit these sort of acts.\u201d",
      "Romano is among dozens of Justice Department lawyers who have resigned, been pushed out or fired in the weeks since Trump's new leadership has taken over and begun making sweeping changes to align the law enforcement agency with the priorities of the Republican president whom the department once prosecuted.",
      "Trump's return to the White House has ushered in a dizzying change for many in the Justice Department, but perhaps few have felt it more than the lawyers who spent years working on the largest-scale serious attack on the Capitol since the war of 1812.",
      "As a deputy chief of the now-disbanded Capitol Siege Section that prosecuted the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, Romano had a close-up view of the evidence, including harrowing videos and court testimony detailing the violence that unfolded when the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify former President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.",
      "Romano joined the Justice Department in 2007 straight out of law school, and was working in the section in Washington that handles public corruption cases on Jan. 6, 2021. He recalled watching the riot unfold on television, and quickly deciding he wanted to help with the prosecution of what he described as a \u201ccrime of historic proportions.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pardons cemented the president's yearslong campaign to rewrite the history of the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "While vying to return to the White House, Trump repeatedly downplayed the violence that left more than 100 police officers injured, and lauded the rioters as patriots and hostages whom he contended were unfairly persecuted by the Justice Department for their political beliefs. Only two Capitol riot defendants were acquitted of all charges, which Trump supporters cited as evidence that Washington juries can\u2019t be fair and impartial. Some Jan. 6 defendants are now considering running for office.",
      "The scope of Trump's clemency hours after the inauguration came as a surprise to many, considering the president had suggested in the weeks prior that instead of blanket pardons, he would look at the Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis. Trump's proclamation described the prosecution as \u201ca grave national injustice\" and declared that the pardons would begin \u201ca process of national reconciliation.\u201d",
      "Trump's pardons led to the release from prison of the leaders of far-right extremist groups convicted of orchestrating violent plots to stop the peaceful transfer of power as well as rioters convicted of brutal attacks on police \u2014 many of whose crimes were captured on camera and broadcast on live TV. Trump has defended his pardons, saying the sentences handed down for actions that day were \u201cridiculous and excessive\" and that \u201cthese are people who actually love our country.\u201d",
      "Romano said the notion that the Jan. 6 defendants were not treated fairly by in the justice system or not given the due process they were entitled is \u201csimply not true.\u201d In many cases, he said prosecutors had overwhelming evidence because the defendants \u201cfilmed themselves proudly committing crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey had the full protection of rights guaranteed to them by the American justice system and the Constitution,\" Romano said. \u201cIt was my experience when dealing with these cases and seeing the way that the rioters and some of their attorneys behaved in court, that their take was that they should be treated like heroes and not prosecuted at all.\u201d",
      "Despite the pardons, Romano said he still believes that the Capitol Siege Section's work was important because it left behind a \u201chistorical record\u201d of what happened on Jan. 6 that cannot be changed.",
      "\u201cIn light of the efforts to whitewash the history of that day, in light of the efforts for people to lie about that day for their own benefit, which is what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s important that people really understand the truth about what happened on January 6th,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "For hundreds of communities nationwide, plans to protect against natural disasters and climate change have been upended because of the Trump administration's elimination of a federal grant program",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The textile mills that once served as the backbone of Mount Pleasant, North Carolina, have long been shuttered, and officials believed federal money would be key to the town's overdue revitalization. They hoped an improved stormwater drainage system and secured electrical wires \u2014 funded through a program to help communities protect against natural disasters and climate change \u2014 would safeguard investments in new businesses like a renovated historic theater to spur the largely rural economy.",
      "Mount Pleasant was about to receive $4 million when the Federal Emergency Management Agency eliminated the program. Officials say their plans \u2014 years in the making \u2014 and those of hundreds of communities nationwide supported by the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program have been upended.",
      "\u201cThis is a generational set of infrastructure projects that would set us up for the next hundred years and it just \u2014 poof \u2014 went away,\u201d said Erin Burris, assistant town manager for Mount Pleasant, 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Charlotte.",
      "FEMA's elimination this month of the BRIC program revoked upwards of $3.6 billion in funding earmarked for communities like Mount Pleasant. Though President Donald Trump has openly questioned whether to shutter FEMA completely, local officials said they were blindsided by the move to end BRIC, established during the Republican president's first term.",
      "Many affected communities are in Republican-dominated, disaster-prone regions. FEMA called the BRIC grants \u201cwasteful\u201d and \u201cpoliticized\u201d tools, but officials and residents say they were a vital use of government resources to proactively protect lives, infrastructure and economies. Money would have gone toward strengthening electrical poles to withstand hurricane-force winds in Louisiana, relocating residents in Pennsylvania\u2019s floodplains and safeguarding water supply lines in Oklahoma\u2019s Tornado Alley.",
      "Disasters affect the vast majority of Americans \u2014 95% live in a county that has had a federally declared weather disaster since 2011, said Amy Chester, director of Rebuild by Design, a nonprofit focused on disaster prevention.",
      "The BRIC program told communities, \u201cWe\u2019re going to help your community be stronger ahead of time,\u201d she said. \u201cCutting one of the sole sources of funding for that need is essentially telling Americans that it's OK that they're suffering.\u201d",
      "Across multiple states, officials said the BRIC program was far from perfect \u2014 they were often frustrated with the wait for funding.",
      "But in southeastern Louisiana, Lafourche Parish President Archie Chaisson said despite his issues with FEMA\u2019s bureaucracy, he\u2019s seen firsthand that money invested to fortify homes and infrastructure works.",
      "The hurricane-ravaged state receives the highest rate of federal disaster assistance per capita, with more than $8 billion pouring in since 2011, according to Rebuild by Design. Lafourche Parish has seen more than a dozen federally declared extreme weather disasters since 2011.",
      "Lafourche had been set to receive more than $20 million from several grants to replace wooden electrical poles with steel and take other steps to lower the soaring costs of home insurance.",
      "Chaisson, a Republican whose parish saw 80% of voters support Trump in November, said he backs efforts to streamline federal agencies \u2014 as long as funding continues to flow for disaster prevention.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that that\u2019s what the president\u2019s trying to do with this,\u201d he said. \"Is there some other way to get the money so we can continue to do these projects? ... No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, the programs themselves and the dollars allocated make our communities more resilient.\"",
      "Research backs him up: A 2024 study funded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found every $1 invested in disaster preparation saved $13 in economic impact, damage and cleanup costs.",
      "Democratic officials in states that lost money have publicly expressed outrage. Few Republicans have joined in at a national level, even though about two-thirds of the top 15 states in total FEMA funds received, spending per person and number of federally declared disasters lean heavily Republican.",
      "An exception has been Louisiana's senior U.S. senator, Bill Cassidy. He took to the Senate floor this month calling for BRIC's reinstatement, saying it's \u201ca lifesaver and a cost-saver.\u201d",
      "About $185 million intended for Louisiana evaporated, and officials had to shelve dozens of applications for hundreds of millions of dollars in new funding, according to data compiled by state and federal agencies.",
      "\u201cThis isn't waste,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cTo do anything other than use that money to fund flood mitigation projects is to thwart the will of Congress.\"",
      "FEMA says more than $3.6 billion of BRIC funds will be returned to the federal Disaster Relief Fund, for disaster response and recovery, and an additional $882 million is being returned to the U.S. Treasury or reapportioned by Congress in the following fiscal year. Agency officials did not comment further for this story.",
      "Twenty-two mostly blue states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit demanding the federal government release obligated funding, including FEMA grants.",
      "The lawsuit highlights Grants Pass in conservative southern Oregon, where FEMA has refused to release BRIC funding awarded for a $50 million water treatment facility.",
      "Flooding could knock out the water supply for 60,000 people for months, said Jason Canady, city public works director. Funding would have been used in part to build a modernized plant on higher ground.",
      "\u201cIf you can\u2019t provide drinking water, hospitals, groceries, restaurants are going to have trouble. Economically, it would be devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really is the cornerstone on which the community is built.\u201d",
      "In Stillwater, Oklahoma, Mayor Will Joyce spent two years working with FEMA on a BRIC application to overhaul and provide backup supply for a regional water system used by 100,000 people. Its 36-mile (58-kilometer) pipeline is at risk of damage from tornadoes and flooding. If it breaks, Stillwater has less than a day's worth of reserve drinking water.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just hope nothing bad happens,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cThis project is a necessity.\u201d",
      "Without FEMA's support, he said, Stillwater will have to double the cost of water for residents to fund the project.",
      "In an open letter, U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan Jr., a northeast Pennsylvania Republican, urged FEMA to revive BRIC, saying communities in his district would struggle to fund disaster adaptation work, including relocating families in flooded homes.",
      "Bresnahan wrote that \u201cprograms like BRIC are not wasteful, but well within the purview of federal coordination of disaster relief efforts\u201d and noted that Trump \u201cpromised not to leave the forgotten men and women of America behind.\u201d",
      "In Mount Pleasant, Whit Moose, the fourth-generation owner of a downtown pharmacy, said few of his neighbors seem aware that funding disappeared, though his own business would have benefited.",
      "\u201cIt was going to be a wonderful thing,\" he said. \"Now we just got to start over.\u201d",
      "Republican voters in the town embrace efforts to downsize government, but the perception is that cuts are focused on federal bureaucracy, related waste and redundancy, or diversity, equity and inclusion spending, said Jim Quick, vice chairman of the Cabarrus County Republican Party.",
      "\u201cIt would be a surprise for us to learn that those budget cuts would be impacting a local municipality,\u201d Quick said. \u201cThe reality is all of us have to trim back.\u201d",
      "Town voters are unlikely to retract their support for Trump, he said, noting that 80% supported him in November.",
      "Burris, the assistant town manager, worries about flooding downtown. And she points to one vulnerable utility pole she's nicknamed Atlas \u2014 after the Greek god carrying the world on his shoulders \u2014 holding up the electricity, internet and telecommunications for the town's 1,700 people.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a special community, and it deserves good things,\" Burris said, choking up. \u201cI don\u2019t know what was political about Mount Pleasant \u2014 little, teeny, tiny Mount Pleasant \u2014 getting a little bit of help with some stormwater flooding.\u201d",

      "Former Grand Rapids police officer Christopher Schurr is set to stand trial in the death of Patrick Lyoya, a 26-year old man and Congolese immigrant who was shot and killed by the officer three years ago",
      "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- The trial of a former Michigan police officer charged with second-degree murder in the killing of a 26-year-old Black man is set to begin in Grand Rapids, three years after the case sparked weeks of protest and national outrage.",
      "Patrick Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant who sought refuge with his family in the U.S. to flee violence in his home country, was fatally shot by former officer Christopher Schurr, who is white.",
      "Lyoya was shot in the back of the head while facedown on the ground following a traffic stop. Schurr\u2019s attorneys argue he acted in self-defense.",
      "Opening statements in the trial begin Monday in downtown Grand Rapids and the trial is expected to last at least a week.",
      "Here is what to know.",
      "Schurr pulled over a vehicle driven by Lyoya over improper license plates on a rainy morning April 4, 2022, in a Grand Rapids residential neighborhood.",
      "Body camera footage and dash camera footage shows Lyoya run from Schurr after the officer asks for his driver's license. Schurr tackles Lyoya and a struggle ensues as Schurr attempts to shoot his Taser at Lyoya.",
      "Schurr\u2019s body camera footage appears to show Lyoya reaching for the officer\u2019s Taser. The body camera footage goes out before the shooting.",
      "A passenger of the vehicle recorded a video. The cellphone footage shows the officer tell Lyoya to let go of the Taser multiple times.",
      "While Lyoya is facedown on the ground and Schurr is on top of him, the officer takes out his firearm and shoots Lyoya in the back of the head.",
      "Lyoya\u2019s family has said he came to the U.S. to get away from prolonged civil unrest involving several rebel groups vying for control of territories in the mineral-rich eastern Congo. He was raising two children in Grand Rapids, a city of around 200,000 people located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Detroit.",
      "After fleeing violence back home, Lyoya ultimately joined a list of names of Black immigrants who sought better lives in the U.S. only to suffer abuse or death at the hands of law enforcement.",
      "Before him, there was Botham Jean, Amadou Diallo and Abner Louima, all men whose cases increased awareness around the global impact of systemic racism in policing.",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights leader who eulogized Lyoya at his 2022 funeral, noted then that Lyoya was killed on April 4, the anniversary of the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Lyoya came to America in search of a better life and \u201cran into an America that we know too well,\u201d Sharpton said.",
      "Lyoya\u2019s killing prompted weeks of protest in the west Michigan city and calls to reform the police department.",
      "Schurr, now 34, was fired by the police department shortly after he was charged with one count of second-degree murder in June 2022.",
      "He had worked for the department for seven years.",
      "Schurr has said he acted in self-defense while prosecutors say the use of lethal force was unnecessary and excessive. If convicted, he faces up to life in prison.",
      "The role of the Taser is likely to play a significant role in Schurr's defense. Prosecutors have argued the Taser already had been deployed and therefore did not pose a threat to Schurr.",
      "Tasers are generally considered non-lethal by police but the narrative often flips when handled by someone who is not law enforcement, said Ian Adams, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina.",
      "Whether Schurr gave proper warning of his use of lethal force also will likely be of note to the jury, Adams said.",
      "\u201cIn the video, you can hear the officer say, \u2018Drop the taser,\u2019 which is a command,\" Adams said. \u201cBut whether or not it\u2019s a warning that an officer is about to use lethal force is going to be contested.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a highly salient case in U.S. policing right now,\u201d Adams said.",
      "Charles Joe Key, who has testified as a consulting witness in police use of force in a different Michigan case, said the Taser can still cause pain and could have incapacitated Schurr even after it had been discharged. Key expected the physical struggle the two engaged in will likely be another factor of Schurr\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cGiven the officer's continued attempts to have the person quit, let go of the Taser, etcetera, then it would be a reasonable analysis by the officer that the person would continue to fight,\u201d Key said.",

      "The woman, a neighborhood resident in her 30s, told The Associated Press she learned of the protest after hearing police helicopters over her apartment. She walked over to investigate around 10:30 p.m. but by then the protest had mostly disbursed. Not wanting to be filmed, she covered her face with a scarf.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I pulled up my scarf, a group of 100 men came over immediately and encircled me,\u201d said the woman, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because she feared for her safety.",

      "Mayor Eric Adams said Sunday that police were investigating \u201ca series of incidents stemming from clashing protests on Thursday that began when a group of anti-Israel protesters surrounded the Chabad Lubavitch World Headquarters \u2014 a Jewish house of worship \u2014 in Brooklyn.\u201d",
      "He said police had spoken to a different woman on the pro-Palestinian side of the protest who suffered injuries after she was harassed by counter-protesters. Photos shared online showed that woman with blood streaming down her face.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: None of this is acceptable, in fact, it is despicable,\u201d Adams added. \u201cNew York City will always be a place where people can peacefully protest, but we will not tolerate violence, trespassing, menacing, or threatening.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in a years-long legal battle over an FBI raid on the wrong Atlanta house",
      "ATLANTA -- Before dawn on Oct. 18, 2017, FBI agents broke down the front door of Trina Martin's Atlanta home, stormed into her bedroom and pointed guns at her and her then-boyfriend as her 7-year-old son screamed for his mom from another room.",
      "Martin, blocked from comforting her son, cowered in disbelief for what she said felt like an eternity. But within minutes, the ordeal was over. The agents realized they had the wrong house.",
      "On Tuesday, an attorney for Martin will go before the U.S. Supreme Court to ask the justices to reinstate her 2019 lawsuit against the U.S. government accusing the agents of assault and battery, false arrest and other violations.",
      "A federal judge in Atlanta dismissed the suit in 2022 and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision last year. The Supreme Court agreed in January to take up the matter.",
      "The key issue before the justices is under what circumstances people can sue the federal government in an effort to hold law enforcement accountable. Martin's attorneys say Congress clearly allowed for those lawsuits in 1974, after a pair of law enforcement raids on wrong houses made headlines, and blocking them would leave little recourse for families like her.",
      "FBI Atlanta spokesperson Tony Thomas said in an email the agency can\u2019t comment on pending litigation. But lawyers for the government argued in Martin's case that courts shouldn\u2019t be \u201csecond-guessing\u201d law enforcement decisions. The FBI agents did advance work and tried to find the right house, making this raid fundamentally different from the no-knock, warrantless raids that led Congress to act in the 1970s, the Justice Department said in court filings starting under the Biden administration.",
      "In dismissing Martin's case, the 11th Circuit largely agreed with that argument, saying courts can't second-guess police officers who make \u201chonest mistakes\u201d in searches. The agent who led the raid said his personal GPS led him to the wrong place. The FBI was looking for a suspected gang member a few houses away.",
      "Martin, 46, said she, her then-boyfriend, Toi Cliatt, and her son were left traumatized.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be the same, mentally, emotionally, psychologically,\u201d she said Friday at the neat, stucco home that was raided. \u201cMentally, you can suppress it, but you can\u2019t really get over it.\u201d",
      "She and Cliatt pointed out where they were sleeping when the agents broke in and the master bathroom closet where they hid.",
      "Martin stopped coaching track because the starting pistol reminded her of the flashbang grenade the agents set off. Cliatt, 54, said he couldn\u2019t sleep, forcing him to leave his truck driving job.",
      "\u201cThe road is hypnotizing,\" he said of driving tired. \"I became a liability to my company.\u201d",
      "Martin said her son became extremely anxious, pulling threads out of his clothes and peeling paint off walls.",
      "Cliatt initially thought the raid was a burglary attempt, so he ran toward the closet, where he kept a shotgun. Martin said her son still expresses fear that she could have died had she confronted the agents while armed.",
      "\u201cIf the Federal Tort Claims Act provides a cause of action for anything, it\u2019s a wrong-house raid like the one the FBI conducted here,\u201d Martin's lawyers wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court.",
      "Other U.S. appeals courts have interpreted the law more favorably for victims of mistaken law enforcement raids, creating conflicting legal standards that only the nation\u2019s highest court can resolve, they say. Public-interest groups across the ideological spectrum have urged the Supreme Court to overturn the 11th Circuit ruling.",
      "After breaking down the door to the house, a member of the FBI SWAT team dragged Cliatt out of the closet and put him in handcuffs.",
      "But one of the agents noticed he did not have the suspect's tattoos, according to court documents. He asked for Cliatt's name and address. Neither matched those of the suspect. The room went quiet as agents realized they had raided the wrong house.",
      "They uncuffed Cliatt and left for the correct house, where they executed the warrant and arrested the man they were after.",
      "The agent leading the raid returned later to apologize and leave a business card with a supervisor's name. But the family received no compensation from the government, not even for the damage to the house, Cliatt said.",
      "Martin said the most harrowing part of the raid was her son's cries.",
      "\u201cWhen you're not able to protect your child or at least fight to protect your child, that's a feeling that no parent ever wants to feel,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. states are adopting and expanding programs that use taxpayer money to pay for private schools even as their costs rise and budget pictures become more uncertain",
      "State lawmakers across the U.S. are pushing to use more taxpayer dollars to pay for private school tuitions and homeschooling expenses even as they try to figure out how to budget in a time of economic uncertainty.",
      "A $1 billion-per-year voucher program the Texas Legislature sent to the governor last week and a longshot push in Congress to expand vouchers nationally, including to states that have rejected them, are focusing attention on the issue.",
      "In states that already have programs to pay private education costs for most students, the expense has quickly gobbled up more of their budgets as revenue growth has slowed or stalled. Besides Texas, Tennessee adopted a program this year, and North Dakota gave serious consideration to one before a veto last week likely ended its prospects this year.",
      "States are required to produce annual spending plans that don't exceed what they bring in. With pandemic-era federal money mostly phased out, voucher opponents fear the programs will come at the expense of other priorities, including public schools.",
      "\u201cEven if they\u2019re being funded by separate revenue sources, it can feel like school choice programs and public schools are competing for the same slice of an increasingly smaller pie,\u201d said Page Forrest, who analyzes state finances at the nonpartisan think tank Pew.",
      "Until five years ago, the boldest school choice programs were limited to lower-income and special-needs students. More recently, scholarships and state-funded savings accounts open to most or all families have been catching on, especially in Republican-controlled states.",
      "This approach costs far more, at least in the short term. That is partly because studies of the efforts in several states have found most of the first students to enroll were already attending private schools, and not receiving taxpayer subsidies at all before the choice programs' launch.",
      "In the coming school year, voucher programs are expected to cost Florida taxpayers almost $3.9 billion, or about $1 in every $13 from the state\u2019s general revenue fund. In Arizona, it\u2019s nearly 5% of the general budget.",
      "An analysis by The Associated Press found the costs in Iowa, Ohio and Oklahoma are over 3% of state general spending this year, or are projected to be in the coming budget year.",
      "Spending is a smaller portion of the budget in states where the scholarship programs are still ramping up. Those include Arkansas, Indiana, North Carolina, Utah and West Virginia.",
      "A flood of campaign money from voucher proponents has been a key factor in convincing previously resistant Republican lawmakers to endorse school choice plans, particularly as advocates have called for more school options coming out of the COVID pandemic.",
      "Programs were approved last year in Alabama and Louisiana and this year in Tennessee, where Republican Gov. Bill Lee has said the $447 million program will be available for the upcoming school year.",
      "A New Hampshire bill raising income limits on an existing program has been moving through the legislature.",
      "In Texas on Thursday, lawmakers sent the governor a bill that would allot more than $10,000 per year for students in accredited private schools. The cost would be capped at $1 billion in the 2026-27 school year, which is a little over 1% of the annual state general funding. But by 2030, a legislative analysis found, it could cost $4.5 billion a year. That could partially be offset by a little over $800 million in savings, because there would be fewer public school students to subsidize.",
      "The Texas House also approved a nearly $8 billion boost to the public education system, which advocates say doesn't cover extra expenses due to inflation.",
      "In energy-dependent North Dakota, GOP Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed an education savings account program, saying it wouldn't expand options for all students and there were implementation problems. He has since said the concept remains a priority for him.",
      "Erin Oban, an organizer with North Dakotans for Public Schools, said the program's costs and unknowns about the state's financial outlook make it a bad time to start a voucher program.",
      "\"I think it would be a very long-term challenge to fund something in the short term you think might be a good idea or that somehow we can afford right now,\u201d she said.",
      "Congressional Republicans are looking to extend an assortment of tax cuts passed in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, plus enact new tax cuts for overtime, tips and Social Security benefits. Proponents of the school choice credit will face stiff competition when it comes to getting included in that mix.",
      "In Ohio, under a budget proposed by House Republicans, vouchers would see a bigger funding increase than public schools starting in July 2026. The plan, which was passed this month, also calls for a way for the state to take back some property tax money already collected by school districts.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney said she doesn\u2019t have a problem with vouchers, so long as public schools are fully funded. But she says the budget plan falls short of that.",
      "It also would continue to increase the amount available for scholarships to private schools, including for the first time making a portion of them available to institutions that operate without any state oversight.",
      "\u201cNinety percent of Ohio\u2019s kids are still in the public schools,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cThey are increasing still more into vouchers while still not giving the public schools what they need \u2014 even though that\u2019s where the bulk of the money is coming from.\u201d",
      "Rachel Brady, a mother of four in Wake Forest, North Carolina, was a leader in a successful push last year for lawmakers to fully fund scholarships after one of her children, and thousands of others, were put on a waiting list after the initial allocation was exhausted.",
      "Lawmakers should look to cut costs elsewhere if they have to in order to keep the programs going, she said.",
      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein \u2014 like Arizona's Katie Hobbs, another Democratic governor \u2014 has proposed scaling back the scholarships. But there is no indication the GOP-controlled legislatures will pump the brakes in either state.",
      "The budget advanced this month by the North Carolina House includes scholarship funding and a smaller raise for public school teachers than Stein proposed.",
      "\u201cThis is a great investment in the future of our kids,\u201d Brady said. \u201cIt\u2019s giving them what they need to be successful in life. I can\u2019t think of a better way to invest in the future of our state.\u201d",

      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Campgrounds, boat ramps and other facilities in at least 30 locations at federal lakes and reservoirs in six states will be closed or have their hours curtailed as of mid-May as the Trump administration tries to rapidly shrink the U.S. government.",
      "Officials at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees the lakes and reservoirs and their amenities for boating, camping, hiking and sightseeing, said they are dealing with staffing shortages and other budgetary restrictions.",

      "The Corps' district office in Omaha, Nebraska, which oversees facilities across a large swath of the Great Plains from western Iowa and Nebraska to Montana's border with Canada, said the changes also will protect hydropower and dam operations.",
      "\"Decisions to make operational changes at recreation areas are not made lightly, and we understand those decisions can be disruptive to the public\u2019s travel plans,\" Garman said in an email to The Associated Press.",

      "\u201c\u201dWe have a lot of fishing and boating, but we also have a lot of just plain tourists coming through to see the dam,\" Broyhill said of Pickstown, located a little more than a half-mile (0.8 kilometers) east of the dam on the Missouri River, about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) north of the Nebraska state line.",
      "\u201cI think there are other places where they could cut that would make more sense,\" she added.",
      "In western Kansas, Sue Graham, manager of Knothead\u2019s bait shop and camping supply store on the east side of Wilson Lake, was skeptical of a plan to limit a campsite there to daytime use as of May 15. The lake is about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of Kansas City, home to the Corps district office for parts of Kansas, Missouri and southern Nebraska.",
      "Graham doesn't think the move will save much money because the campsite is used only by residents who own boat ramps nearby, but Corps officials would \u201cshoot themselves in the foot\u201d if they went further because of lost fee revenues, she said, adding that she does not expect her shop to be affected.",
      "\u201cPeople are still going to come out,\u201d Graham said.",
      "The Kansas City district plans to close visitor information centers at two Kansas lakes including Hillsdale, outside the Kansas City area, and Kanopolis, in central Kansas. The Corps will not allow overnight camping in 25 \u201cprimitive,\u201d no-amenities spots in two areas at Harlan County Lake in western Nebraska near the Kansas state line. The sites and water nearby still will be accessible during the day.",
      "Emily Coffin, the district's natural resource section chief, said the district has pursued efficiency initiatives for five or six years that will lead to fewer visitor-staff interactions. They include self-service campsite registrations, cashless parking and payments through codes scanned with smartphones.",
      "\u201cIt just may be a little bit more noticeable because we have more of that built on than maybe we did two years ago,\u201d she said.",
      "In March, the Corps' Baltimore district closed three campgrounds at Raystown Lake in central Pennsylvania and a campground, swimming beach and boat ramp at Cowanesque Lake in northern Pennsylvania.",
      "The Omaha district announced earlier this month that it would close six campgrounds in the Dakotas on May 1, as well as three visitor centers in South Dakota and Montana. It also plans to suspend or limit tours of four South Dakota dam powerhouses and decrease tours at Fort Peck Dam in northeast Montana.",
      "The Corps district for southeastern Washington state announced last week it was closing two visitor centers and eight camping and recreation areas there.",

      "\"Frankly, I don't think it's ever going to happen with respect to any other [country]... whether it's Panama or Greenland or elsewhere,\" he added.",

      "The US is a big market for Canadian businesses with roughly 75% of Canada's exports heading south.",
      "Canada accounts for a much smaller 17% of US exports.",
      "Canada is also America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. America's trade deficit with Canada - expected to be $45bn in 2024 - was mostly driven by US energy demands.",
      "Canada and US relations have been strained in recent months, driven by Trump's talk of a \"51st state\" and referring to previous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \"governor\" - the title for leaders of individual American states.",
      "The US president has also sparked a global trade war in which Canada was one of the first countries targeted with tariffs.",
      "Trump has partially imposed a blanket 25% tariff on various Canadian goods, along with 25% import taxes on all aluminium and steel imports, but has exempted products covered by a US, Canada and Mexico trade deal known as USMCA.",
      "Canada has retaliated with some C$60bn ($42bn; \u00a332bn) worth of tariffs on US goods.",
      "Carney said talks with Trump would be \"on our terms, not on their terms\".",
      "\"There is a partnership to be had, an economic and security partnership,\" he said.",

      "Carney has touted his experience handling global economic crises as a way to deal with Trump on tariffs.",

      "\"Remember that we supply them [the US] with vital energy. Remember that we supply their farmers with basically all their fertiliser,\" Carney told the BBC.",
      "\"We deserve respect. We expect respect and I'm sure we'll get it in due course again, and then we can have these discussions.\"",
      "Canada and the US, along with Mexico, have deeply integrated economies, with billions of pounds worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders on a daily basis, for example, car parts.",
      "The introduction of tariffs, which are taxes levied on goods as they enter a country and paid for by the importer, threatens decades of collaborations between the nations.",
      "Trump has argued tariffs will encourage more Americans to buy domestically-made goods, which will ultimately boost US manufacturing and jobs.",
      "Trade with allies being 'put to the test'",
      "While America's main opponent in the global trade conflict is China, the introduction of Trump's blanket, so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the likes of the UK and other European countries has led to allies seeking fresh agreements in response to barriers to trading with the world's largest economy.",
      "Carney, who endorsed UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves during the British general election, said \"one would think\" that Canada and the UK could sign a stalled free trade agreement as part of diversifying trade, but highlighted about 95% of trade between the countries is effectively tariff-free already.",
      "\"We could expand the level of integration between our countries, like-minded countries. You think about defence partnerships, and those conversations have just just begun, so there's a lot that we can do,\" he added.",
      "In a statement congratulating Carney, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"I know we will continue to work closely on defence, security, trade and investment.\"",
      "Carney said the G7 summit hosted by Canada in June would be \"very important\" in deciding the future path of the global trade war, adding it would \"put to the test\" whether the group of the world's seven most advanced economies - which includes the US - was still the most \"like-minded of like-minded countries\".",
      "The summit will occur just before the 90-day pause on some of Trump's higher tariffs is set to expire."

      "There was a half expectation here that Carney would immediately sue for peace with President Trump when the polls closed on the election. It has emphatically not happened.",
      "In the final days of polling, in his victory speech in Ottawa, and in his interview with me, he clearly intends to continue with the approach that has brought him to elected power, with a majority still possible. Even if he falls just short of a majority, two of the other main party leaders have lost their seats, and are likely to sign up to some degree behind a united Canada agenda on issues facing the US.",
      "Underpinning this approach is absolute conviction that the US is making a mistake that will primarily and visibly backfire on itself, its companies, and its consumers. The fact the White House is attacking Amazon for \"hostile acts\" in publishing tariffs is a cast-iron example of this. President Trump's gun is pointed primarily at his own feet, the thinking goes.",
      "Jordan Peterson, an implacable opponent of Mark Carney, recently lamented on Joe Rogan's podcast that \"once Carney is elected, Trump will not have a more seasoned enemy in the West. Carney is very well connected especially in Europe and the UK.\"",
      "While \"enemy\" is overstating it, Peterson was right, and additionally Carney is also very adept at understanding the nexus between markets and headlines. He made a number of announcements as PM about rethinking the purchase of US fighter jets, slightly changing the purchases of US government debt, all of which would have quickly focused some minds in the US.",

He also dismissed President Trump's territorial ambitions not just for his country, but Greenland and Panama too.",

      "But it said it had decided not to move forward and the idea had never been under consideration for its main platform.",
      "The White House decision to go on the attack over the report is an indication of the pressure it is facing over its new import taxes, which analysts say will lead to higher prices for consumers and increase the chances of a recession.",
      "At a news conference marking the president's first 100 days in office, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she had discussed Amazon's reported move with the president and argued it represented \"another reason why Americans should buy American\".",
      "\"This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,\" she said. \"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\"",
      "Trump has ramped up tariffs since re-entering office in January, measures he argues will boost manufacturing and raise tax revenue for the US.",
      "Even after rolling back some of his initial plans this month, Trump's announcements have left many foreign imports facing new duties of at least 10%, while products from China are facing import taxes of at least 145%.",
      "The measures have prompted a sharp drop in trade between the two countries, and has raised fears of supply shocks and product shortages from baby prams to umbrellas, items for which China is a major supplier.",

      "Merchants from China represent about half of the sellers on Amazon in the US, according to analysts.",
      "Amazon's plan to detail the tariff impact for customers was first reported by Punchbowl News on Tuesday, citing an anonymous source.",
      "Asked about the report, Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle confirmed that the company had considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products for its Amazon Haul store.",
      "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" he said in a statement to the BBC.",
      "A source familiar with the Amazon discussions said they had been sparked by the end of the exemption from tariffs for shipments from China worth less than $800.",
      "The person said the decision not to spotlight the new costs was not a response to the White House complaints on Tuesday.",
      "But asked by reporters about his call with Mr Bezos, Trump said the billionaire, who stepped down as chief executive in 2021, had \"solved the problem\".",
      "\"Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. He did the right thing. He's a good guy,\" he said.",
      "Amazon was among the many businesses to donate money to the president's inauguration and Mr Bezos was given a seat of honour at the event.",
      "Mr Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, met Trump after the election and has praised his push for deregulation and lower taxes.",
      "But the two men have had a tense relationship in the past.",
      "Trump repeatedly criticised Amazon and the Washington Post during his first term, while Mr Bezos in 2016 accused Trump of using rhetoric that \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" and once joked about blasting him to space in a rocket.",
      "In 2019, Amazon filed a lawsuit against the Pentagon, alleging that it had been denied a $10bn contract due to Trump's decision to \"pursue his own personal and political ends\" to harm Mr Bezos, \"his perceived political enemy\".",

    "story": [
      "Sportswear giant Adidas has warned import taxes imposed by President Donald Trump will lead to higher prices in the US for popular trainers including the Gazelle and Samba.",
      "\"Since we currently cannot produce almost any of our products in the US, these higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all our products for the US market,\" chief executive Bjorn Gulden said on Tuesday.",
      "Clothing manufacturers are among the businesses hit hardest by tariffs as they source labour from countries such as China and Vietnam, which have faced steep levies from the US.",
      "Adidas did not comment on how much prices would rise, but said the trade war had \"put a stop to\" an upgrade in its financial outlook.",
      "Mr Gulden said it was \"currently impossible to quantify\" cost increases resulting from tariffs, \"or to conclude what impact this could have on the consumer demand for our products\".",
      "\"Given the uncertainty around the negotiations between the US and the different exporting countries, we do not know what the final tariffs will be. Therefore, we cannot make any 'final' decisions on what to do,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

    "summary": "Documents show Doug Barrowman-linked company owned the prince's start-up competition for two years.",
    "story": [
      "One of Prince Andrew's prized business assets was administered for two years by a company controlled by the controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman, the BBC can reveal.",
      "After the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK).",
      "Barrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers.",
      "A lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".",
      "Pitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\".",
      "Documents filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.",
      "Controversial associates",
      "Prince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles.",
      "The prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy.",
      "Mr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful.",
      "Mr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined \u00a3150,000 in 2022.",
      "In January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company.",
      "The National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Author Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"",
      "Who owns Pitch@Palace?",
      "Pitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts:",
      "a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholdersan international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company",
      "a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholders",
      "an international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company",
      "Both arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal.",
      "Nonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\".",
      "Earlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations.",
      "However, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name.",
      "Founded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family.",
      "But early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited.",
      "This company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it.",
      "Corporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman.",
      "Investigations into Barrowman's companies",
      "In 2023, ownership of Knox House Trustees (UK) Ltd \u2013 which still owned Pitch@Palace Global - was transferred to Arthur Lancaster, an accountant who has a longstanding working relationship with both the prince and Mr Barrowman. This remains the situation today.",
      "The same year Mr Lancaster took over as the sole director and shareholder of PPE Medpro. He was also a director of many of the companies involved in the AML tax avoidance case.",
      "The judge in that case called him \"evasive\" and said he had \"real concerns as to the reliability of Mr Lancaster's evidence\", which contained \"significant inconsistencies\".",
      "After the case, his lawyer wrote to the court arguing that the conclusions were \"unnecessarily harsh\", that Mr Lancaster had been a \"diligent and truthful witness\", and that his efforts to provide information had been hampered by the Covid pandemic.",
      "For decades the Royal Family has held investments through nominees, and still does. In the past this has served to keep details of their holdings private, though not in this case. Prince Andrew's involvement in Pitch@Palace Global is well known, and he is listed as having \"significant influence or control\" over the company on Companies House.",
      "Mr Barrowman's lawyer said in a statement: \"Mr Lancaster was a director of KHT (UK) Ltd which provided company administration services to a number of external companies, including Pitch@Palace, a company wholly owned by the duke. Mr Lancaster acted for the duke in a personal capacity at all times and has been an associate of the duke for many years.\"",
      "Mr Lancaster declined to comment. Prince Andrew did not respond to requests for comment."

    "summary": "The president is due to hold a rally in Michigan, which is home to Ford, General Motors and Stellantis.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump is set to take action to ease the impact of new tariffs on the auto industry, which had sparked warnings about higher prices and the potential for significant hits to sales and production.",
      "The change will allow carmakers with US factories to reduce the amount they pay in import taxes on foreign parts, using a formula tied to how many cars they sell and the price.",
      "The provision is intended to provide relief to businesses for two years as they rework their supply chains, White House officials said.",
      "They also said that parts made in Canada and Mexico that follow North America free trade rules would not face tariffs, an exemption previously described as temporary.",
      "It comes as Trump is due to hold a rally in Michigan on Tuesday to mark his first 100 days in office.",
      "The state is home to the so-called Detroit Three carmakers - Ford, General Motors (GM) and Stellantis - and a network of more than 1,000 major suppliers to the industry.",
      "Those firms and the wider industry have been plunged into uncertainty since Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts in March, saying he wanted to expand domestic car manufacturing - an industry the White House sees as key to national security.",
      "Trump's tariff announcement drove a spike in sales, as consumers rushed to get ahead of the tariffs. But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond.",
      "General Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, said it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance.",
      "In an unusual move, it also postponed the call that had been set to discuss the results.",
      "Tariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.",
      "The duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May.",
      "Last week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts.",
      "A letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".",
      "Under the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of the cars they sell.",
      "That share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.",
      "The White House said it meant that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US, Canada or Mexico would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year.",
      "The adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.",
      "The White House said it also intended to shield firms from facing multiple tariffs on the same item, saying the car tariffs would not be added to duties on steel and aluminium.",
      "Ahead of the announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures.",
      "\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"",
      "Ford said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".",
      "\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.",
      "The car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".",
      "\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".",
      "Stellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs.",
      "\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added.",

      "The sugar tax applied to fizzy drinks could be extended to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes under new government plans.",
      "The government is consulting on proposals to end the exemption from the tax for milk-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes such as oats or rice.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in her autumn budget last year that the government was considering widening the levy.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride labelled the move a \"sucker punch\" to households when Labour had \"already pushed up the cost of living for families\".",
      "The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.",
      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",
      "On Monday, the Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.",
      "Some 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced in accordance with the proposals, government analysis says.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government was consulting on \"going further\" with the existing levy after it was shown to have had a particular impact on children's health.",
      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",
      "Announcing the planned changes, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning \"it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar\".",
      "\"By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,\" it added.",
      "The government estimates that 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK are not subject to the tax because of widespread reformulation by manufacturers since 2018.",
      "But it added that the levy had effectively created a \"target\" of just below the 5g threshold, and products had clustered below 5g as a result.",
      "The government consultation will run from Monday until 21 July.",
      "No drinks with sweeteners for younger children, say UK advisers",
      "Top-brand baby food pouches lack key nutrients",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "The SDIL has raised a total of \u00a31.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, according to government statistics released last September. Revenue for HMRC for the 2023-24 financial year was \u00a3338 million.",
      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",
      "Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she had not been a \"fan\" of the levy when it was first introduced by her party, calling it \"a bit too much nanny state\".",
      "She told BBC Breakfast: \"My worry is that the government does not have any plans... and so they're just looking for what else they can tax.\"",
      "But Tam Fry, the chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said he welcomed the proposals \"tremendously\" and said it was \"high-time\" the levy was extended.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"not a game-changer\" in terms of tackling obesity, but \"one of those things that is needed\".",
      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",
      "It said \"significant progress\" had already been made and \"many years of investment in research and development\" had reduced sugar in soft drinks by 46% in the last five years, with a 30% sugar reduction in pre-packed milk-based drinks in the last three years.",
      "It added that food and drink manufacturers were facing a series of inflationary pressures and called on the government to \"continue to create the right conditions for businesses to innovate and also be clear about their long-term goals to promote business confidence\"."

    "summary": "BBC economics editor Faisal Islam on what comes next for the US president's central economic policy.",
    "story": [
      "Over the past week I have crossed a radically changing North America, from Arizona to Washington DC in the US and then on to Saskatchewan in Canada, witnessing clear evidence of the consequences of historic change in the way the world economy is run. Huge uncertainty means nobody really knows where it is headed.",
      "The walk from the White House Rose Garden to the HQ of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) takes just 9 minutes. In the past few days, in this very short stroll, two very different worlds collided with each other.",
      "The former is the place where at the start of this month, with an extraordinary chart and questionable equation, President Trump took on the world with his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\".",
      "The latter is the place where just three weeks on from that, after rowback, market tumult, and confusion, the finance ministers of the entire world gathered to try to pick up the pieces, even as they were still rebounding off the ground.",
      "At the IMF meetings that included gatherings of G7 and G20 members, something unique happened. The US representatives faced not open hostility, but exasperation, bewilderment and deep concern, from almost the entire rest of the world, for having sent the global economy back towards a crisis, just as it had finally emerged from four years of pandemic, war and energy shocks.",
      "The concern was most acutely expressed by the East Asian countries, who had in early April been classed as \"looters and pillagers\" of American jobs because of the fact that these economies, many of them key allies of the US, export more goods to the US than the other way around.",
      "The talk of the G7 was the quiet determined fury of the Japanese, who were said to feel betrayed by the US turn on trade, and whose confusion over what US trade negotiators actually wanted recently sparked a sell off of US government bonds. The finance minister Katsunobu Kato told the roundtable the US tariffs were \"highly disappointing\", hurting growth and destabilising markets.",
      "I was reminded of the time at the IMF in 2022 when developing country finance ministers asked me if everything was OK in Britain during the mini budget crisis of Liz Truss' government. Then the UK was the source of fragility, trading like an emerging market, when its normal role was solving crises in those markets.",
      "The bugle of retreat",
      "In the face of febrile bond markets, this week the faint sound of the bugle of retreat on the US trade war got louder. A forest of olive branches seemed to be on offer from the US to get the Chinese to come back to the table to negotiate, from respect for their economic achievements to the offer of a deal to do a \"beautiful rebalancing\" of the world economy. It was a far cry from the claims of \"looting and pillaging\".",
      "Yet a much hoped for meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart did not materialise.",
      "Most of the rest of the world leaving their meetings with Bessent are reporting back an assumption that the US is edging away from what it cannot acknowledge was overreach.",
      "And there is a widespread view that there is no need for countries to retaliate, when the CEOs of Walmart and Target are telling the President privately that there will be empty shelves from early May.",
      "The collapse in container traffic from China to the port of Los Angeles - the main artery of the world economy for the first quarter of the 21st century - is the one to watch. The IMF's boffins say they can start to see the impact from space as satellites track fewer, increasingly empty ships leaving China's ports. Of course this will be denied by the US.",
      "West Wing farce",
      "It is true that there was far more relative calm at the end of the IMF Meetings compared to the beginning. Why? Because the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has seized control of the tariff agenda and has almost single-handedly calmed markets and the rest of the world.",
      "Financial diplomats put down the Bessent ascendancy and the critical 90 day pause in the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs to some farcical West Wing antics.",
      "The story goes Bessent was able to get the ear of Trump regarding the bond market damage from his tariffs, only after a separate White House economic adviser managed to use the bait of a fake meeting to lure away the hardline tariff hawk and author of the infamous reciprocal tariff equation Pete Navarro from patrolling the Oval Office.",
      "Wall Street bosses are thought to have suggested that only by firing Navarro, can some semblance of normality return. Insiders suggest that Trump will never get rid of his trade adviser, as he served time in jail after the January 6 riots in support of the President.",
      "At best this sounds like the future of the world economy and all our livelihoods played out like a real time Hilary Mantel novel about the court of Trump. At worst it is leading to financiers and Governments starting to think the unthinkable about how much further the US or the rest of the world might go and  currently, the uncertainty about everything is more concerning than the direct impact of the tariffs.",
      "A nightmarish scenario",
      "And that uncertainty is prompting some fairly wild theories about what might come next.",
      "At times of acute global financial stress, \"swap lines\" between central banks exist to preserve financial stability, making sure there is a constant supply of US dollars.",
      "But now some of the world's central banks have started to game out what might happen if the US chose to use its dollar \"swap lines\" to the rest of the world as a form of diplomatic leverage or even a weapon.",
      "Is it inconceivable that the US might deny them or veto the Federal Reserve handing them out? One just has to assume it is inconceivable, because in many instances there is no way to mitigate it. But the nightmarish scenario for the world financial system, however unlikely, is now not wholly implausible.",
      "A little less unlikely perhaps is the idea that those countries with a trade surplus with the US could help fund the US with an effective tax on their holdings of US government debt. Some of these ideas have been floated in speeches and papers by US government advisers.",
      "In this atmosphere, worrying but incorrect ideas can start to infect confidence. For example, there was a \"whodunnit\" about significant selling of US Government debt just after the original tariff reveal.",
      "Some speculated it was China. But Tokyo currently happens to be the biggest overall creditor to the US. Was this Japanese selling that helped make the case to Trump for the tariff pause, an almost deliberate diplomatic tactic? Two very well connected officials suggested this scenario to me, which shows the febrility right now, even though it seems implausible.",
      "No one crawling",
      "While Bessent commanded the weekend airwaves in the US having assumed control of this process, it was still quite something to see him sending the message that \"Investors need to know that the U.S. government bond market is the safest and soundest in the world\". If you have to say it\u2026",
      "Another significant finance minister told me of his global counterparts that \"no one was crawling to the Americans\" given the unbeatable effectiveness of the US having to negotiate with its own bond market.",
      "Amid the uncertainty, no one seems to know if the \"baseline\" universal tariff of 10% is even negotiable. President Trump's message that tariff revenue could be sufficient to \"completely eliminate\" income taxes for \"many people\" would rather suggest that it will stay.",
      "\"It depends on who you talk to on which day of week\u2026 I've heard three different positions articulated on the baseline, one by the White House, one by the Commerce Dept, and one by a US Trade representative,\" said one senior G7 official. \"Do you know what the final outcome will be? Whatever the president wants at that moment, shaped by industrial, market and political issues,\" I was told.",
      "Consistent UK diplomacy",
      "This is of particular interest to the UK, because the baseline bites the UK hard. Alongside big tariffs on cars which are our biggest goods export and likely further ones on pharmaceuticals, our second most important export, the US hit to the UK appears inexplicable when by the White House's own creative definition of \"trade cheating\" - running a goods surplus - the US is actually slightly \"cheating\" the UK.",
      "I put this point to the Chancellor several times over two interviews in Washington. She diplomatically rejected that suggestion.",
      "But eventually right at the end of our last interview, strolling around the famous reflecting pool in between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, she volunteered something rather telling of the changing world. \"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told me. It caused a bit of a fuss back home, but it was not an off the cuff gaffe.",
      "That's because concessions to the US on food standards are off limits for domestic political reasons. This appears to have been accepted by the Americans after consistent UK diplomacy, as the focus remains on a technology prosperity deal. It seems pretty clear now that the UK is going to push ahead with a \"high ambition high alignment\" deal with the European Union. And word had got out here among finance ministers.",
      "A very senior international official used the example of the UK-EU rapprochement as an example of the rest of the world coordinating and \"doing its homework\" as a response to US unreliability. \"Brexit was a bitter divorce, but now I see you are dating again,\" I was told privately.",
      "There was also some relief that the US remained engaged with the World Bank and IMF. The Project 2025 plan that was published in April 2023 by the think tank The Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump presidency envisaged the US leaving those international organisations, and the Governor of the Bank of England recently expressed his concerns to me.",
      "Bessent used the meetings to confirm US commitment to the Bank and the Fund, albeit with a return to their core functions and away from considerations of social issues and the environment. The Europeans counted that as a win.",
      "A grand battle?",
      "But a bigger canvas remains. Will the US use this trade war in order to try to corral the rest of the world on to its side in a grand battle with China? It seems astonishing to have annoyed allies so significantly and fundamentally if this was the strategic point of all this. A test case here is Spain, which faces 20% tariffs as an EU member state.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez met President Xi in Beijing a fortnight ago. Spain's booming economy (the fastest growing advanced economy last year -  and forecast to be again this year) is the only one to be upgraded by the IMF. It is built on green energy, access to foreign labour, tourism and significant investment and technology transfer from China. The US took a dim view of the visit and held a \"frank\" discussion with its finance minister Carlos Cuerpo.",
      "He appeared rather unmoved by all this, telling me at the Semafor World Economy Summit in DC: \"There's a huge trade deficit with China, and we need to correct that by opening up to China, by also attracting Chinese investment, of course, within an overall economic security umbrella. And that can only be done by engaging and actually talking to the Chinese authorities\".",
      "Spain has secured notable Chinese electric vehicle factory investment and technology transfer. The US doesn't like it. But if the US wanted to persuade the Spanish and EU of its reliable long term allyship against China, it is difficult to see the strategy in the past month's tariff accusations and chaos.",
      "Whoever wins in Canada's election will bring that G7 economy firmly back into this globally transformative debate. Could the newly elected Canadian PM start a full fat negotiation with the UK too? And then he will chair the G7 Summit in Canada in June as President Trump's 90 day deadline expires. It is presumed Donald Trump will travel to Alberta, to the country he claims should be part of his own.",
      "There is a path to trade peace, calm and deescalation. But it could get much worse too. This is a critical few weeks for the world economy.",

    "summary": "There is greater competition among mortgage firms but no guarantee that rates will keep falling, brokers say.",
    "story": [
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit and a substantial fee.",
      "More frequent cuts in interest rates by the Bank of England are expected this year, amid global economic turmoil.",
      "However, lenders are already reflecting those predicted cuts in their latest deals, suggesting borrowers could be taking a risk by relying on ongoing drops in mortgage costs.",
      "\"If the base rate does come down then there is a chance fixes could get a bit cheaper but there are no guarantees,\" said Aaron Strutt, from broker Trinity Financial.",
      "Timing issue for borrowers",
      "Some tracker and variable rate mortgages move closely in line with the Bank of England's base rate, which is expected to be cut from 4.5% on 8 May.",
      "However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "The average rate for a two-year fixed deal is now 5.21%, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts. A typical five-year deal has a rate of 5.12%.",
      "Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder",
      "Low-deposit mortgage deals highest for 17 years",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "However, lenders are offering attention-grabbing sub-4% deals again to some customers. They were seen briefly in February, but market-watchers had not expected them to return for a while.",
      "The fallout from US tariffs policy has led the markets to settle on a view of more base rate cuts this year.",
      "As a result, so-called swap rates - a key measure on which mortgage deals are priced - have fallen.",
      "Equally, there is now little to tell between swap rates - and therefore mortgage rates - over two years and five years.",
      "\"More borrowers are taking two-year fixes on the assumption rates will reduce but many may be better off taking longer term fixes for the payment security,\" Mr Strutt said.",
      "Rachael Hunnisett believes that many people want to step away from \"the roulette wheel\" of short-term fixed-rate deals.",
      "\"There is a cohort who just do not want to take that level of risk with their home,\" she said, arguing that everyday payments, like children's activities, are affected if borrowers find themselves having to pay a higher rate after two years.",
      "She is the director of mortgage distribution at April Mortgages, which provides 10 and 15-year mortgages. The rates are generally higher, but the certainty of payments she feels is a selling point.",
      "The company is now offering home loans at seven times a borrower's income, which is higher than for many shorter-term loans.",
      "Brokers say this is one example of a host of lenders competing by potentially allowing customers more flexibility to borrow larger amounts, particularly first-time buyers.",
      "They also point to the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide, making changes earlier in the week that offered improved rates to those remortgaging - another sign of greater competition.",
      "David Hollingworth, from broker L&C, said that the sub-4% deals were now becoming part of the core range of mortgages offered by the big lenders.",
      "But he warned the global economic uncertainty meant these rates could quite quickly move either way.",
      "As a result, borrowers were increasingly applying for deals, almost as a backstop months before their old deals expired, he said. If rates improve before the new deal starts, then they could still switch to a better rate."

      "The transaction also includes Airbus work packages at the Spirit factory at Prestwick in Scotland.",
      "However, the future of the Prestwick operation is uncertain with Airbus saying it will \"assess its long-term strategy for the site as part of ongoing industrial planning\".",
      "Airbus added that the Prestwick operation is being acquired to ensure continuity of production but will operate as an affiliate business.",
      "Alan Perry from the GMB union said the Belfast sites should \"remain as one identity\" and that the deal \"raises serious concerns over the future of more than 2,500 workers who don't work on the Airbus contract\".",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx20lyg4385o",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 16:07:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The US central bank is one of Trump's favourite punching bags. But how serious is the threat?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank.",
      "Elevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.",
      "But however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse.",
      "Not only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Coming at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.",
      "The tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.",
      "It came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.",
      "But Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.",
      "Donald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy.",
      "\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"",
      "What is Trump's problem with Powell?",
      "Trump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.",
      "Lower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.",
      "Trump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.",
      "He objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.",
      "\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.",
      "A threat to Fed independence?",
      "Trump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.",
      "Nor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.",
      "Trump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.",
      "It has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.",
      "The idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.",
      "Sarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled.",
      "If shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.",
      "\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.",
      "Can Trump fire Powell?",
      "Joe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.",
      "\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy.",
      "He said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed.",
      "\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"",
      "Powell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him.",
      "But the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate.",
      "By law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.",
      "The administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure.",
      "Mark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.",
      "\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.",
      "Asked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: \"Damage done.\""

      "The government says the tax changes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves were needed to stabilise the economy.",
      "They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27.",
      "But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses.",
      "Cutting a client's hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum.",
      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from \u00a37,576 to \u00a318,482 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",
      "Update 26 April 2025: This article was amended to correct the cost of Kerry's business rates, which she said increased from about \u00a37,000, not from \u00a3700 as we originally stated.",

    "story": [
      "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.",
      "I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.",
      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",
      "Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.",
      "He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.",
      "Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.",
      "They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.",
      "Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.",
      "The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.",
      "It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.",
      "But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.",
      "Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.",
      "To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.",
      "So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.",
      "\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.",
      "\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning \u2013 such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way \u2013 a challenge,\" they said.",
      "At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.",
      "For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.",
      "The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.",
      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",
      "Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.",
      "\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.",
      "Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (\u00a312,500).",
      "Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.",
      "In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.",
      "Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.",
      "For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.",
      "So how can US and European robot makers compete with that?",
      "Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.",
      "While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.",
      "\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.",
      "\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"",
      "As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.",
      "Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.",
      "\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.",
      "Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.",
      "\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.",
      "Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.",
      "\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.",
      "\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.",
      "He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.",
      "The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.",
      "So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.",
      "\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.",

    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",
      "Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.",
      "Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments before this article was initially published. However, it subsequently put out a statement denying that the country's initially high tariff from the US had anything to do with its relationship with China.",
      "It pointed to the website of the US Trade Representative, which it said \"very transparently indicated that the formula for determining the tariff applied to each country is based on the trade balance between the US and the country concerned, and that the formula does not include any variable to capture the relationship of the country concerned with any other country whatsoever\".",
      "The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",

      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",

      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:31:13 GMT",
    "summary": "The Irish band have a reputation for provocation, but a new row has led to rising scrutiny and anger.",
    "story": [
      "To their fans, west Belfast rave-rap group Kneecap are a rowdy, subversive force of nature. But to many others, their inflammatory political messages make them dangerous and amoral.",
      "Following in the footsteps of anti-establishment rap groups like NWA and Run The Jewels, the trio present themselves as dissident underdogs, giving a voice to the oppressed.",
      "Their lyrics, delivered in a rapid-fire mix of English and Irish, cover everything from drug-fuelled parties to their desire to free Northern Ireland from British rule.",
      "On stage and on film, they've created a riotous experience that's thrilled Glastonbury, won a Bafta award, and inspired what's been called an \"Irish language revolution\".",
      "But their rising profile has resulted in increased scrutiny and anger about their political statements.",
      "During an incendiary performance at the Coachella music festival in California earlier this month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they've been called anti-Semitic and branded \"terrorist sympathisers\".",
      "Now, footage from two previous gigs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police in the UK.",
      "In one, the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.",
      "Kneecap have responded with a statement, saying they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah\".",
      "They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.",
      "But Cox's widower Brendan was unimpressed, calling their statement \"only half an apology\". Downing Street agreed, describing their words as \"half-hearted\" and \"completely unacceptable\".",
      "The row was discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday, with Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp calling their comments \"evil\".",
      "It isn't the band's first brush with controversy. If anything, controversy is in their DNA. But this time, the fallout threatens to engulf their career, with venues and festivals under pressure to cancel the band's gigs.",
      "To understand how we got here, here's Kneecap's origin story.",
      "Kneecap were formed in 2017 by rappers Mo Chara (Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh) and M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in), alongside beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh).",
      "Their career was sparked by an incident in which M\u00f3gla\u00ed and a friend were out spray-painting the day before a march in support of an Irish Language Act.",
      "M\u00f3gla\u00ed had written \"cearta\" (rights) on a bus stop when police arrived. He fled but his friend was arrested, and spent a night in the cells after refusing to speak English to the police.",
      "They documented the incident in the song C.E.A.R.T.A, which they released \"just for the craic. No plans for after,\" Mo Chara told the Irish Times.",
      "To their surprise, the song was playlisted by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, only to be removed after listeners complained about drug references in the lyrics.",
      "After that, their output was sporadic. The mixtape 3CAG (slang for the drug MDMA) arrived in 2018, followed by the singles H.O.O.D and MAM - dedicated to M\u00f3gla\u00ed's mother, who had died by suicide.",
      "Those early records showcased an ability to move between sharp satire, tender vulnerability and the experiences of Northern Ireland's \"ceasefire babies\" - the generation born around the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.",
      "Talking to the BBC in 2023, the band said they were inspired by US bands like Dead Prez, NWA and Wu Tang Clan.",
      "\"Rebel music in Ireland has all the same sort of ideas as hip-hop in America. A community that's oppressed, using songs to revolt in some way,\" said Mo Chara.",
      "Unusually, they perform most of their lyrics in Irish, reclaiming the language from rural folk music.",
      "\"The only way that Irish history and mythology was passed down was orally. I think that's why it's important for us to have that intertwined with our music,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told Crack magazine last year.",
      "Kneecap's lyrics frequently contain Republican slang and slogans. Even their name is a reference to the IRA's chosen method of punishment for alleged drug dealers during the Troubles.",
      "The messaging has landed them in hot water before. DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed lost his job as a teacher in 2020 after his school was alerted to a video of a concert where he'd painted \"Brits out\" on his buttocks.",
      "Two years later, the band made headlines in Belfast after commissioning a mural of a burning police vehicle with a slogan criticising Northern Ireland's pre-Good Friday police force, the RUC.",
      "Designed to promote a festival appearance, it was criticised by politicians across the  spectrum.",
      "\"Loathe to give the band more publicity,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long, \"but as a community we need to start asking ourselves what messages we're sending out about the kind of future we want.\"",
      "The band have claimed their take on Republicanism is partially tongue-in-cheek - satirising the self-important sloganeering they grew up with.",
      "\"Republicanism is so vast, and on a spectrum,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told the New York Times. \"We like to toy with it. We like to take the irony on.\"",
      "Certainly, the band's gleeful celebration of drug culture puts them at odds with the old guard of the movement - but the band are serious about their desire for a unified Ireland.",
      "\"The British government has failed us for 100 years,\" Mo Charra told Vulture last year. \"It's not like this is a trial run. You've had enough time and it's failed.\"",
      "Awards success",
      "Kneecap's reputation grew in 2024 with the release of a film, also called Kneecap, which presented a semi-fictional, and often hilarious, account of their rise to fame.",
      "Starring the band as themselves, with Michael Fassbender as M\u00f3gla\u00ed's father, the movie won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising its \"punky defiance\" and \"unruly energy\", and was nominated for six Baftas.",
      "It was followed by their debut album, Fine Art, a concept record that threw fans into a hedonistic night out with the band at a fictional Belfast pub called The Rutz.",
      "With songs that skewered the music industry and addressed Northern Ireland's mental health crisis, it showcased a band with more to say than their reputation suggested.",
      "Still, in an era of sanitised, apolitical music, Kneecap's instincts for provocation and protest were inevitably going to draw attention.",
      "Pro-Palestinian chants have featured in their gigs since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza war. But when they brought those messages to Coachella, they faced a new level of scrutiny and criticism.",
      "Kneecap weren't the only people who uttered pro-Palestinian messages at the festival, but accusations of genocide and video screens that declared \"F*** Israel\" were seen by some as crossing a line into hate speech.",
      "The organisers of Israel's Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed by Hamas in 2023, said Kneecap's message \"deeply hurt\" their community, and invited the band to visit an exhibition about the victims and survivors \u2013 \"not to shame or silence but to connect\".",
      "Others took a more strident tone. A music industry group called The Creative Community For Peace, along with Sharon Osbourne, called on the US government to revoke the band's visas.",
      "The band's manager defended their actions. Citing Hamas-run health ministry figures that more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed since the start of the war, Daniel Lambert characterised criticism of the Coachella performance as \"moral hysteria\".",
      "\"If somebody's hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by,\" he told RT\u00c91. \"But it's really important to speak truth and thankfully, the lads are not afraid to do that.",
      "\"They have the bravery and the conviction, given where they've come from in a post-conflict society, to stand up for what's right, and [they] are willing to do that despite the fact that it may harm their career.\"",
      "Right now, their career is under intense pressure.",
      "Since Coachella, Kneecap have received death threats and have been dropped by their booking agents in the US, which could jeopardise their visas ahead of a forthcoming sold-out tour.",
      "The discovery of the concert video in which the band shouted \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" and advised the audience to \"kill your local MP\" shocked the political establishment, with counter-terrorism police reviewing the footage.",
      "In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney has called for the band to be dropped from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival, saying their comments had \"crossed a line\".",
      "The Eden Project in Cornwall has cancelled their gig in July, and others, including Glastonbury, are under pressure to call off appearances.",
      "Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said on Tuesday: \"There is an ongoing live police investigation, so the government would urge the organisers at the Glastonbury Festival to think very carefully about who is invited to perform there later this year.\"",
      "At the same time, the criticism has only increased the profile of an act who were essentially an underground act a month ago.",

      "Pullman, 78, said he was \"relieved\" to have \"come out of the end alive and able to see it being made into a book and published\".",
      "The Rose Field refers to a magnetic or gravitational field, and was mentioned in the opening chapters of Northern Lights, when scholars at Lyra's Oxford college secretly discussed a mysterious phenomenon called Dust.",

      "Beyond the world of Dust and daemons, this book has been influenced by real-life global events, including the rise of tech billionaires, Pullman revealed.",

      "\"She was possibly the most famous, and the one that divides people the most, and so there was something in me that decided to choose her as the person that should [be singled out],\" Allen continued.",
      "\"Well, anyway, I'm just sorry. I would have been hurt if it had been me and someone in my industry used me and my name, and I saw that, and I'm sorry.\"",

      "\"I mean, what the... hell was all that about?\" Allen said. \"I mean, in all seriousness, what? Why? For why?",
      "\"It's so out of touch. Like, we're on the brink of recession. People are really... struggling to make ends meet and put food on their tables.\"",
      "She added: \"And the fact that they've, like, made it like some sort of feminist thing...\"",
      "The flight, on a rocket designed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's company Blue Origin, marked the first all-female mission to space since 1963.",

      "US actress Olivia Munn described the flight as \"gluttonous\", explaining: \"It's so much money to go to space, and there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs. What's the point? Is it historic that you guys are going on a ride?\"",
      "But King hit back, saying she was \"very disappointed and very saddened\" by the backlash. \"Have you been?\" she asked the haters. \"If you've been and you still feel that way after you come back, please let's have a conversation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Mike Peters, front man of Welsh rockers The Alarm and a long-standing cancer campaigner and fundraiser, has died aged 66.",
      "His band was formed in 1981 in Rhyl, Denbighshire, out of the punk era and had a top 20 hit, Sixty Eight Guns, two years later.",
      "It typified an anthemic style of song but their unpretentious and down-to-earth approach earned loyal followings on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Peters lived with blood cancer for 30 years, following his diagnosis of lymphoma in 1995, and later having chronic lymphocytic leukaemia twice.",
      "He was born in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, and lived in Dyserth with his wife of 39 years, Jules - who had fought her own cancer battle - and their sons Dylan, 20 and Evan, 18.",
      "He was awarded the MBE in 2019 for his services to cancer care.",
      "Peters - who had worked in the computer department for Kwik Save supermarket - had started the band The Toilets in Rhyl in 1977, after seeing the Sex Pistols play in Chester.",
      "After various changes of line-up, notably the introduction of guitarist Dave Sharp, and changes of name, The Alarm played their first gig in Prestatyn in 1981.",
      "They would go on to sell an estimated five million records and also become the first Welsh musicians since Tom Jones and Bonnie Tyler to crack America.",
      "Thanks to a support slot with U2 on their 1983 US tour, The Alarm gained a transatlantic following - not an inconsiderable achievement.",
      "Their debut album Declaration was released in 1984. As well as Sixty Eight Guns, it also included another favourite, Blaze of Glory.",
      "The band had honed their live performances by extensive touring, and were also reliable \"go-to\" support choice for big names - which included Bob Dylan, Queen and U2 again - including an appreciative crowd at Cardiff's National Stadium in 1987.",
      "Despite their travels, The Alarm still had strong bonds with their homeland and Peters was able to live quietly in north Wales.",
      "The band also released a Welsh-language version of their 1989 album Change, called Newid.",
      "Peters announced from the stage in London that he was quitting The Alarm in 1991 but continued to work with The Poets Of Justice, the line-up including his wife Jules.",
      "In 1999, Peters worked with The Cult guitarist Billy Duffy forming a band called Coloursound.",
      "Duffy said he felt the Welshman \"inspired millions of people\" during his career.",
      "\"(Music) was his lifeblood. Everything was an inspiration for him to express his feelings through music,\" he added.",
      "He reformed The Alarm in 2000 and also worked as the singer for Big Country for a couple of years from 2011.",
      "The Alarm has sold more than five million albums and had 16 UK Top 50 singles.",
      "In 2004, as a humorous stunt aimed at the music industry and its obsession with youth, Peters released a single called 45 RPM - a retro-punk song - under the pseudonym of The Poppy Fields.",
      "He pretended his group were teenagers from Chester, who mimed along to the video for the song. It entered the top 30.",
      "The storyline was perfect to be translated into a film, Vinyl - directed by Sara Sugarman, incidentally from Rhyl, and an Alarm fan.",
      "Peters was first diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1995 and described his relationship with the cancer over the next two decades as like \"fighting a war\".",
      "At the end of 2005, the singer was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, which returned in 2015 before he went into remission.",
      "Rock star hopes therapy will end 30 years of cancer",
      "Rock star in cancer remission after drug trial",
      "Cancer recovery inspires band's return",
      "He co-founded the Love Hope Strength Foundation alongside his wife to help recruit bone marrow donors at live music shows.",
      "It also involved Peters and fellow musicians taking treks to the Himalayas, to peaks including Mount Kilimanjaro and Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon, in his native Wales.",
      "The charity's director, Kirsty Thomson, called him a \"brilliant advocate\" of the NHS, adding that he \"loved life like nobody else I know\".",
      "The 2007 concert was billed the \"world's highest\", watched by 3m online. In 2017, his Big Busk involved a walk between cancer wards at each north Wales hospital and ended on the summit of Snowdon.",
      "He would take his message to Washington and Westminster.",
      "Peters also filmed a documentary about his cancer fight and one with his wife Jules for BBC Wales about a year in their lives and her recovery from breast cancer, While We Still Have Time.",
      "Peters joined Bruce Springsteen on stage at charity concert in 2014 and musicians who had joined The Alarm for impromptu appearances ranged from Bono to Neil Young.",
      "Peters was affable and approachable and tireless in both his campaigning - and in continuing to tour with his music across Europe and the United States, as well as writing new material.",
      "There were also annual weekend events in Llandudno - The Gathering - which brought together fans from all over to celebrate the music of Peters and The Alarm.",
      "In March 2018, part of a tour of Germany was postponed after Peters suffered an allergic reaction to his medication.",
      "In 2025, he became ill again when his Richter syndrome - an aggressive form of lymphoma - returned.",
      "He said it would have killed him within two months if left untreated, adding music had kept him alive since his latest diagnosis.",
      "Peters said he hoped a highly specialised therapy which \"re-programmes\" his immune cells would lead to a \"cancer free life\".",
      "\"It was devastating because it all happened in an instant,\" he said.",
      "\"There was no chance to even think about it.\"",
      "In 2018, he told Guitar World magazine that his \"simple message\" was \"to stay alive and appreciate every second you've got\".",
      "\"Live right up to the last breath and stay positive about the world, your family and the environment you live in.\"",

    "story": [
      "The trial has begun of 10 people who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at a Paris hotel in 2016.",
      "The reality TV star and business woman was tied up and held at gunpoint in a luxury suite where she was staying during Paris Fashion Week.",
      "About $10m (\u00a37.5m) worth of jewels were taken from her, including a $4m (\u00a32.9m) diamond engagement from then-husband Kanye West.",
      "In a grand courtroom adorned with 19th Century tapestries, the court was given a fascinating snapshot into the lives of the diverse cast of characters suspected of involvement in the heist.",
      "For the first one up - 71-year-old Yunice Abbas - this was done through a \"enqu\u00eate de personnalit\u00e9\", a sort of background report on a person accused of a crime which French courts regularly include in their trials. These reports take in elements of the defendant's family history, behaviour and work to paint a picture of their lives and help jurors make a decision.",
      "The court heard a long list of crimes that Abbas has been found guilty of in the past - from petty crime and small-time drug trafficking to bank robberies - and retraced his difficult childhood, which was partly spent in Algeria and marked by the deaths of two of his siblings.",
      "Abbas - who has spent almost a third of his life in jail - has already admitted to his role in the heist, and even wrote a memoir entitled I Held Up Kim Kardashian. The president of the court, David De Pas, suggested that the book shows Abbas was proud of what he did - something he has repeatedly denied.",
      "When asked if he had any sympathy for his victims, Abbas said that he never did before the Kardashian heist, \"but this time I do regret what I did\u2026 It opened my eyes.\"",
      "Abbas said that while watching television in jail, he was confronted with relentless coverage of the burglary, which made him realise how much Kim Kardashian had suffered.",
      "\"We just grabbed the lady's handbag but I have discovered there's trauma behind it,\" he said.",
      "The court also focused on Gary Madar, whose brother's company provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for several years. Now 35, the father-of-two has been accused of feeding information to the gang about Kim Kardashian's location on the night of the heist.",
      "At the time, Gary worked as a customer service agent in airports for the transport company. His task was to welcome VIPs arriving at Paris airports and escort them through passport and customs checks. Through this job, he met the Kardashians several times.",
      "But he also worked at a caf\u00e9 owned by another defendant, Florus H\u00e9roui, 52, to whom investigators believe Madar passed on information about Kim Kardashian.",
      "He has denied this and his lawyer has told the BBC that Madar should not be on the dock as there is \"no solid proof\" of his involvement.",
      "Marc Boyer, 78, who is accused of supplying the weapon that was used to threaten Kardashian, was also questioned at length. He expressed regret that his son Marc-Alexandre Boyer - also a defendant - had grown up surrounded by \"thieves\" and \"crooks\" who had led him to make the wrong life choices.",
      "The rest of the week will see more defendants take the stand as the trial ticks on towards 13 May - the day Kim Kardashian is expected to testify.",
      "The vast majority of the 400 journalists reporting on this trial are expected to flock to the courthouse that day, and court staff are unsure how they will accommodate so many reporters who will want a front seat.",

      "'Grandpa robbers' held Kim Kardashian at gunpoint - but didn't know who she was",

      "The court will only hear from 10 out of the 12 people who were arrested in 2017, as one died last month, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he has advanced dementia.",
      "Another, Aomar Ait Khedache, will be up on Wednesday - but he is now nearly deaf and mute and will have to write his answers down on a piece of paper.",
      "The trial is taking place eight and a half years after the heist.",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and author of a book on the robbery, told the BBC that Paris courts were busy with large terrorism trials for several years, which created a backlog.",
      "She also said the long wait had to do with the defendants' age and health issues which meant they spent little time in provisional detention.",
      "\"Once they were freed it felt less urgent for judges to bring this to trial,\" Tourancheau said."

    "story": [
      "A child has damaged a painting worth millions of pounds by the American artist Mark Rothko at a museum in Rotterdam.",
      "A spokesperson for the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen said it was considering the \"next steps\" for the treatment of Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8.",
      "The damage occurred during an \"unguarded moment\", a museum spokesperson told the Dutch media outlet Algemeen Dagblad (AD) last week.",
      "A spokesperson for the museum told the BBC the damage was \"superficial\", adding: \"Small scratches are visible in the unvarnished paint layer in the lower part of the painting\".",
      "The abstract painting is estimated to be worth up to \u20ac50m (\u00a342.5m), according to newspaper AD.",
      "\"Conservation expertise has been sought in the Netherlands and abroad. We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting\", the museum spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.",
      "Sophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".",
      "This is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.",
      "\"In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,\" Ms McAloone said.",
      "The Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot \u2013 a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum \u2013 as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of \"public favourites\" from the gallery's collection.",
      "Jonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"",
      "\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Restoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.",
      "He said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.",
      "Conservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.",
      "\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Rothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.",
      "Umaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.",
      "During his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.",
      "Rachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".",
      "This includes \"accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions\", she said.",
      "She said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum.",
      "The loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.",
      "The museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.",
      "The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.",
      "In 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.",
      "Sharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: \"It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.\"",
      "The Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.",
      "Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 painting is one of several works of modern art that have been damaged in the Netherlands in recent years.",
      "In November 2024, multiple screen prints by the US pop artist Andy Warhol were damaged by thieves during an attempted robbery of the MPV art gallery in the town of Oisterwijk.",
      "In another incident, a Dutch town hall admitted it \"most likely\" disposed of 46 artworks by accident \u2013 including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen \u2013 during renovation works last year.",

      "In August last year, a four-year-old boy accidentally smashed a 3,500-year-old jar into pieces at the Hecht Museum in Israel.",
      "At the time, Hecht Museum worker Lihi Laszlo told the BBC the museum would not treat the incident \"with severity\" because \"the jar was accidentally damaged by a young child\".",

      "He said he now needed \"space to heal and be with the people who know who I really am\".",

      "He said he responded: \"I've said something really stupid. They're investigating my behaviour, but more and more people are coming forward with complaints about me. Mum, they're not all true. I haven't done these things.\"",
      "Wallace revealed that his mother recently died, adding that it was \"terribly sad\" that she had spent the last few days of her life reading \"horrible things\" about him.",
      "One of the women who spoke to BBC News as part of its investigation was broadcaster Kirsty Wark who appeared on Celebrity MasterChef.",
      "Wark accused Wallace of telling \"sexualised jokes\" during the filming of the show, and said that it left people feeling \"uncomfortable\".",
      "But Wallace says he was never aware he had offended her until it came to light last year, saying: \"I thought we got on.\"",
      "Other high-profile media personalities, including Vanessa Feltz and Kirstie Allsopp, also spoke up at the time.",
      "Wallace said that Feltz's complaint \"knocked him for six\", and also pushed back against Allsopp's comments about his language, saying: \"I wouldn't have said that.\"",
      "'Absolutely not true'",
      "Writing on Instagram in November, singer Sir Rod Stewart described Wallace as an \"ill-mannered bully\", and said the presenter \"humiliated\" his wife Penny Lancaster when she was on Masterchef in 2021.",
      "Addressing that claim, Wallace said it was a \"shame\" as he liked Sir Rod. He acknowledged there had been a \"falling out\" between himself and Lancaster, but said it was over \"whether an orchid should stay on a bowl of soup or not\".",
      "He also addressed other allegations that emerged towards the end of last year, including one that he'd walked around on set naked with a sock on his penis.",
      "He admitted to putting a \"sock over my private bits\" and opening his dressing room door shouting \"hooray\", but claimed he did this to three friends who were in the studio after filming had finished, rather than while it was taking place.",
      "He admitted that some of the inappropriate jokes were \"probably true\", saying: \"Some of what's been said sounds like the sort of comments I'd have made.\"",
      "But he insisted he never groped any workers, calling those claims \"absolutely not true\".",
      "He also said that many of those who work with him had been supportive, including John Torode, his co-presenter on MasterChef.",
      "Torode has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "When Banijay launched an inquiry, Wallace said his \"world tumbled in\".",
      "\"It's very difficult to explain the pressure unless you've been through it. I thought about suicide all the time: \"Is my insurance up to date? Will [Wallace's wife] Anna get some money? She doesn't deserve this. It would be better if I wasn't here.\"",
      "He told the newspaper Banijay had arranged for a crisis mentor to support him.",
      "Wallace said he was recently diagnosed with autism, saying: \"I want to make it absolutely clear I'm not blaming my behaviour on my diagnosis, but it does explain a hell of a lot to me.\"",
      "He added that he accepts he was \"very slow to wake up\" to a changing work environment.",
      "\"It wasn't until seven years ago that I had a massive wake-up call and realised the loud, energetic greengrocer persona I was on the telly was, maybe, becoming redundant. So I changed.\"",
      "\"I honestly never meant to upset anyone. I thought I was going in every day and just delivering what was wanted. I didn't realise I was causing any problems.\"",
      "Wallace has been one of Britain's most high profile presenters for more than two decades.",
      "BBC News, which is editorially independent from the wider organisation, started investigating Wallace last summer, after becoming aware of allegations. The claims were made across five shows, from 2005 to 2022.",
      "Most of the allegations came from production workers. Many were young female freelancers.",
      "Allegations heard include Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to \"give her a fashion show\", and telling a junior female colleague he wasn't wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans.",
      "BBC News has also heard from a former MasterChef worker who says he showed her topless pictures of himself and asked for massages, and a former worker on Channel 5's Gregg Wallace's Big Weekends, who says he was fascinated by the fact she dated women and asked for the logistics of how it worked.",
      "Another female worker on MasterChef in 2019 says Wallace talked about his sex life; a female worker on the BBC Good Food Show in 2010 says Wallace stared at her chest; and a male worker on MasterChef in 2005-06 says Wallace regularly said sexually explicit things on set.",
      "After BBC News's initial investigation, more women came forward with claims.",
      "One woman says he touched her bottom at an event and another says he pressed his crotch against her while filming on a different show.",
      "His lawyers have strongly denied he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature.",
      "Wallace has repeatedly declined interview requests from BBC News.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 16:51:37 GMT",
    "summary": "As the BBC finds some pockets of bad behaviour among a small number of staff, what happens next?",
    "story": [
      "Samir Shah's anger was obvious, the BBC chairman's voice shaking with fury as he delivered his message of change. \"If you think you're too big to live by the values of this organisation, you are wrong and we will find you out,\" he promised.",
      "He left little doubt about his personal determination to stamp out bad behaviour at the BBC.",
      "But will he succeed?",
      "The Respect at Work 2025 report was commissioned following Huw Edwards' guilty pleas last year. The corporation was reeling from the revelations surrounding one of its biggest names.",
      "But 12 years ago, a report was published after a scandal involving another former BBC star.",
      "That 2013 Respect at Work review looked into BBC culture in light of Jimmy Savile's depravity. It found bullying was an issue inside the corporation, with some people viewed as \"untouchable\" because of their status and colleagues too scared to speak up, for fear of reprisals.",
      "The then director general, Tony Hall, said he wanted \"zero tolerance of bullying\". The BBC brought in a series of measures, including updating its policies and setting up a confidential helpline.",
      "'We have your backs'",
      "On Monday, the current director general, Tim Davie, said he was \"totally committed to make long-lasting change.\"",
      "He said staff must feel confident to speak up and they will be supported (unless their complaints are malicious) without any negative impact on their careers.",
      "\"We have your backs,\" he said. He announced a series of measures including a new code of conduct, a more robust disciplinary policy and leadership training.",
      "All organisations have bad apples, but the power dynamics in a media company are multi-layered. Well-known presenters, for example, can wield extraordinary influence, as well as behind-the-scenes editors and managers.",
      "Then there is the issue of an industry that often relies on freelancers, who have even less power. 30% of freelancers told the report they had seen inappropriate behaviour at the BBC. Less than half said they would feel safe speaking up. That is sobering.",
      "Equally, in BBC news and current affairs, only 48% of staff who answered a recent survey said they thought the corporation dealt with bullying and harassment concerns appropriately.",
      "This is all about power imbalances. Will BBC employees ever feel confident that the organisation really will have their backs if they decide to complain?",
      "My sense is that the biggest consideration when deciding whether to make a formal complaint is the fact that the person you are complaining about will be told you have done so. If that person is your boss, or a close colleague, how can you be sure that it won't have an impact on your career?",
      "But equally, if you don't take formal action, then there is a perception that offenders consistently get away with bad behaviour. There are rumours and stories about particular individuals inside the BBC, just as there are in all organisations.",
      "The proof, perhaps, of whether these new policies are working will be whether the small number of people whose names are often raised internally, accused informally of bad behaviour, will now face more scrutiny; whether colleagues will feel confident to raise a formal complaint.",
      "The report makes clear the majority of people enjoy working at the BBC and that there isn't a toxic culture. But it also talks of some names repeated several times as people who are \"not being held to account for poor behaviour\".",
      "Who are those people and is any action being taken in light of this review?",
      "The report doesn't name names, either complainants or those accused.",
      "A BBC source told me the corporation will always act if necessary on any information it becomes aware of.",
      "But in pockets of the BBC there is real anger that bullying by individuals is an open secret - and there's a belief that complainants aren't protected. Shah and Davie are promising that will change.",
      "It takes time to change cultures. While some behaviour is always unacceptable - sexual harassment or physical assault for example - the report also talks about grey areas, including colleagues being tetchy or rude, ridiculing ideas or using aggressive language. The plan is to nip these in the bud.",
      "Sometimes this kind of behaviour has been blamed on working in a high pressure environment, for example a newsroom, where short-term emotions can run high. It's not an excuse, Davie said.",
      "The report was commissioned because of the BBC's newsroom's most high-profile star, Huw Edwards. But his name was never mentioned over its 60 pages.",
      "Perhaps the evidence of real culture change will be if this is the last report the BBC ever does about workplace culture."

    "story": [
      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

      "Pugh previously appeared as Yelena in 2021's Black Widow movie and the Disney+ series Hawkeye.",

      "Full of bewildering beauty and life-affirming anthems, it was written over the last three years, as she unexpectedly fell in love.",
      "\"I spent much of my life as a lone wolf,\" she tells BBC News, \"so hyper-independent that it became a defining trait.\"",
      "\"But as I explored vulnerability and reciprocity in my relationships, I realised\u2026 we can change by the minute, and that's okay.",
      "\"In my ancestors' Choctaw language, there are no words for 'is' or 'are,' reflecting their belief that people, animals, and plants are not permanent or static. That's the biggest lesson of the past few years: I can be a lone wolf sometimes and still belong to a community.\"",
      "That realisation manifests in the lovestruck slacker rock of Dragonfly, and the finger-plucked Neptune Baby, with its refrain, \"I'm a boat, and you are the water\".",
      "Not that Crain's relationship was all plain sailing. Her new partner struggles with addiction, and a track called Melatonin finds her listing the items she brought them in rehab \u2013 \"mint choc-chip ice cream, cigarettes, a watch\".",
      "\"You got it bad, but you got me,\" she reassures.",
      "It's an album of stunning poetic clarity and emotion \u2013 typified by the title track, an old-time country-rock ballad inspired by her love of detective novels.",
      "\"The word 'Gumshoe' has been in every writing notebook since I was a teenager,\" she says. \"After watching The Maltese Falcon, I considered how detached detective characters are and imagined two loners finding love.",

    "story": [
      "The Netherlands, March 2025. Yungblud is leaving his hotel in Amsterdam when he's approached by a fan in floods of tears.",
      "\"You saved my life,\" she sobs.",
      "\"No, you saved your own life,\" he replies, quietly. \"Maybe the music was the soundtrack, but you saved your own life, OK?\"",
      "Leaning in for a hug, he adds, \"Don't be sad, be happy. I love ya.\"",
      "It's a remarkably touching moment, full of compassion and devoid of rock star ego.",
      "Two weeks later, after a video of the encounter goes viral, Yungblud is still moved by the memory.",
      "\"I didn't think people would see that, except me and her,\" he says, \"but it was such a moment for me.\"",
      "The interaction crystallised something he'd felt for a while.",
      "\"I always said that Bowie and My Chemical Romance saved my life, but ultimately you have to find yourself,\" he says.",
      "\"Like this morning, I put my headphones on and I listened to [The Verve's] Lucky Man, and it made me go, 'Oh, I'm ready to face the day'.",
      "\"But Richard Ashcroft didn't tell me I was ready to face the day. I said that to myself.",
      "\"That's what I was trying to tell that girl in Amsterdam.\"",
      "Self-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way.",
      "On the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase, a Louis Theroux documentary and enough clout to run his own festival.",
      "But if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal.",
      "And the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised after long queues and a lack of water caused fans to pass out and miss the concert.",
      "Harrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low.",
      "\"Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make,\" he says.",
      "\"It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional.\"",
      "The problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work.",
      "\"It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost,\" he observes.",
      "\"I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again.\"",
      "Nowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single, Hello Heaven, Hello.",
      "Over nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda.",
      "\"Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from?\" Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition.",
      "The song's purposefully unsuited to radio \u2013 unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment.",
      "Combining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album.",
      "\"We were actually discouraged from doing it,\" he says.",
      "\"My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'.\"",
      "Warming to the theme, he continues: \"The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited.",
      "\"It can't be like a 50% version of me.\"",
      "To achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds.",
      "Professional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut.",
      "\"When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it,\" he argues.",
      "\"When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth.\"",
      "'Sexiness and liberation'",
      "One of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about \"feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that\".",
      "\"I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous,\" says the singer, who last year revealed he'd developed an eating disorder due to body dysmorphia.",
      "\"But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing.\"",
      "He ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news after Russia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina.",
      "\"I met him before all that,\" says Harrison, \"but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me.",
      "\"If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out.\"",
      "Fans have noticed the change\u2026 drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his \"shirt-off era\".",
      "\"Maybe the shirt-off era is a comeback to all the comments I've had,\" he laughs.",
      "\"I'm claiming a freedom and a sexiness and a liberation.\"",
      "He's clearly found a degree of serenity, without surrendering the restless energy that propelled him to fame.",
      "Part of that is down to control. In January, he created a new company that brings together his core business of recorded music with touring operations, his fashion brand and his music festival, Bludfest.",
      "The event kicked off in Milton Keynes last summer but suffered teething troubles, when fans were stuck in long queues.",
      "\"I will fully take responsibility for that,\" says the star, who claims he was \"backstage screaming\" at police and promoters to get the lines moving.",
      "\"The problem was, there were six gates open when there should have been 12,\" he says, suggesting people underestimated his fans' dedication.",
      "\"When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day.",
      "\"With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.\"",
      "Dedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud.",
      "He built the community directly from his phone and, whether intended or not, that connection has sustained his career - insulating him from the tyrannies of radio playlists and streaming placement.",
      "Maintaining a personal relationship becomes harder as his fanbase grows but, ever astute, he hired a fan to oversee his social accounts.",
      "\"She's called Jules Budd. She used to come to my gigs in Austin and she'd sell confetti to pay for gas money to the next city.",
      "\"She built an account called Yungblud Army, and she's amazing at letting me understand what are people feeling.",
      "\"If people are outside and security aren't treating them right, I know about it because she's in contact with them. So I brought her in to make the community safer as it gets bigger.\"",
      "With his new album, he wants to make that community even bigger. Harking back to the sounds of Queen and David Bowie, he says it'll \"reclaim the good chords\" (Asus4 and Em7, in case you're wondering).",
      "\"The shackles are off,\" he grins.",
      "\"We made an album to showcase our ambition and the way we want to play.",
      "\"Can you imagine seeing Yungblud in a stadium? 100% yes. Let's do it.\""

    "story": [
      "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt \"overwhelming excitement\" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.",
      "The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would \"do Paddington proud\", adding that the musical numbers are \"my favourite songs I've ever written\".",
      "The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.",
      "The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.",
      "Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt \"so honoured and lucky\" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect \"all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly\".",
      "\"There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,\" he joked.",
      "Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.",
      "He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the show was formally announced in 2023.",
      "With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature \"lots of juicy new material\".",
      "\"We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,\" she said.",
      "\"Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.\"",
      "Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.",
      "The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.",
      "Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what \"the musical language\" of Paddington was. \"Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,\" he explained.",
      "He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with \"a very fast 'yes please'\", but began writing music for the show right away.",
      "\"While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.\"",
      "He reflected: \"My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.\"",
      "The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.",
      "In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.",
      "It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.",
      "\"I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!\" joked Swale. \"He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!\"",
      "She continued: \"I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.\"",
      "'The politics of Paddington'",
      "Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for \"really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it\u201d, adding: \u201cEvery single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.",
      "\"I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.\"",
      "As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical \"also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington\".",
      "\"For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.\"",
      "Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be \"fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right\".",
      "He added: \"I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\"",
      "The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, \"so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in\", he explained.",
      "\"It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.\"",
      "Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.",

      "Breast X-rays, which look for cancers that are too small to see or feel, are only permitted to be undertaken by female health workers. Mammography is the only health examination carried out exclusively by female staff.",
      "According to radiographers, the vacancy rate among mammographers who specialise in breast exams is 17.5%.",
      "Among mammographers who assess women who have found a lump in their breast or have a family history of breast cancer, the figure is 20%.",
      "It takes three to four years to qualify as a radiographer through a university degree.",
      "Changes to staffing were being discussed at the annual SoR conference, with discussions also taking place over whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening programme.",
      "Sue Johnson, who represents the SoR, told the BBC: \"The role of the radiographer has developed and evolved and there is a much broader scope to the job role than simply taking the images.",
      "\"It's a very desirable and enjoyable career and men are saying 'we would like to access that same career and we could help deliver the service'\".",
      "Johnson said she believes this could help the recruitment of more radiographers and open up the job to more qualified people because \"mammography doesn't get as much publicity\" as other health professions.",
      "The prospect of men performing mammograms has been explored unsuccessfully in the past, but Johnson believes \"the world has changed\" and that \"the time is right\" to start reconsidering the role.",
      "She says women would still be given a choice on who conducted their mammogram if they didn't feel comfortable with a man doing it.",
      "Ms Reed said having two mammograms 15 years apart were responsible for \"saving\" her life.",
      "She's now had two mastectomies after two separate breast cancer diagnoses.",
      "Because of what she's gone through, having a male radiographer \"wouldn't bother me at all\", she says.",
      "But Claire Rowney, chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Now, says \"it's vital that efforts to build up the screening workforce do not inadvertently damage uptake of breast screening\".",
      "She says that \"while we welcome every effort to reduce staff shortages and delays in breast screening, we know that concerns about being seen by a male mammographer already deter some women from attending breast screening, even with current staffing being all-female\".",
      "Ms Rowney adds that recruiting male mammographers could be an issue for some women in ethnic minority communities, who may have greater concerns around preserving their modesty and who may be less likely to take up the offer of screening."

    "story": [
      "Baby food pouches from six of the UK's leading brands are failing to meet key nutritional needs of babies and toddlers - with parents being \"misled\" by their marketing - BBC Panorama has been told.",
      "Laboratory testing of 18 pouches made by Ella's Kitchen, Heinz, Piccolo, Little Freddie, Aldi and Lidl found many to be low in vitamin C and iron, while some contained more sugar in a single pouch than a one-year-old should have in a day.",
      "There are more than 250 of these products on the multi-million pound baby pouch market - they have become a staple for many households with babies and children up to the age of two or three. They are convenient and have long shelf lives.",
      "Experts have told the BBC the products should only be used sparingly, are not replacements for homemade meals, and can cause children health problems if used as their main source of nutrition.",
      "When we put this to the brands, the market leader Ella's Kitchen said it agreed with all three points.",
      "All of the brands said their products were intended as a complementary part of a child's varied weaning diet.",
      "The brands also told the BBC they are committed to infant health, and they provide quality, nutritional products that meet UK regulations.",
      "Young children should be protected from commercial interests, experts told us - while the government said existing laws already set nutritional requirements for baby foods.",
      "A laboratory approved by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service was commissioned by Panorama to independently test the nutritional value of a fruit, yoghurt and savoury pouch from each of the six leading brands.",
      "Our investigation found:",
      "Savoury pouches, used by some families as replacements for main meals, containing less than 5% of the key nutrient, iron, that an infant needs each dayA fruit pouch in which virtually all the vitamin C had been lost during the manufacturing processFruit pouches marketed as having \"no added sugar\" containing about four teaspoons of so-called \"free sugars\" (created when fruit is blended) - something that experts say is \"intentionally misleading\"Pouches being marketed to babies as young as four months old, against the clear recommendations of the UK government and the World Health Organization (WHO)",

      "Fruit pouches marketed as having \"no added sugar\" containing about four teaspoons of so-called \"free sugars\" (created when fruit is blended) - something that experts say is \"intentionally misleading\"",
      "Pouches being marketed to babies as young as four months old, against the clear recommendations of the UK government and the World Health Organization (WHO)",
      "'Misleading' nutrition claims",
      "\"You think they are going to be nutritionally good for your child,\" said one parent, Hazel, during a focus group on baby food pouches at Leeds University.",
      "\"You trust the brands\u2026 it's really, really concerning.\"",
      "However, public health experts have been unified in telling the BBC that no parent should feel guilty for using the products.",
      "The nutritional claims of baby food pouches are misleading, according to Dr Alison Tedstone, who spent nine years as chief nutritionist to the UK government.",
      "\"You think as a parent it is a healthy product, and it just isn't,\" she said.",
      "Many of the biggest brands use \"halo-marketing\" - surrounding products with healthy words or phrases - according to Dr Tedstone.",
      "Ella's Kitchen, for example, describes savoury products as \"perfectly balanced for growing babies\", while Piccolo claims many pouches are \"packed with goodness\".",
      "Some Little Freddie pouches come branded as \"Good for Brains\" and Heinz claims some of its fruit products are \"as nutritionally good as homemade\".",
      "Piccolo and Little Freddie told us their packaging accurately represented the key ingredients and flavours contained in their products, while Ella's Kitchen said it \"would never use\" misleading claims. Heinz did not address our questions on marketing.",
      "'Very, very low in iron'",
      "Savoury pouches are often used by parents as a main meal - but of the six such products sent for laboratory testing, none could provide a significant contribution to the 7.8mg of iron an infant needs in a day.",
      "Iron is a key nutrient for a healthy immune system, growth and brain development - but levels are not shown on the products' labelling.",
      "By seven months old, \"babies' iron stores are starting to run out, so we now need to get that from food,\" explained Bahee Van de Bor, a paediatric dietitian from the British Dietetic Association.",
      "Our lab results found that none of the pouches came close to the 3mg of iron that Ms Van de Bor would want an infant to be having from a main meal.",
      "Of the four pouches that contained meat - known to be a good source of iron - Heinz's Sweet Potato, Chicken and Veggies contained the lowest, with just over 0.3mg of iron.",
      "\"That's really low. Very, very low,\" Ms Van de Bor told the BBC. \"That doesn't meet even 5% of [an infant's] daily requirements.\"",
      "The ingredients list on the back of the pouch says it contains 12% chicken - \"so the iron-rich food is a very tiny amount,\" she said.",
      "All the companies stressed they were committed to providing nutritious products for babies, and that their products were intended as a complementary part of a child's varied weaning diet. Little Freddie added that its products were not intended to be meal replacements for one-year-olds.",
      "Sugar and tooth decay",
      "Alongside savoury products, companies also sell pouches containing only fruit, which are leaving dentists concerned about the potential for tooth decay.",
      "The NHS says an infant should have as little sugar as possible, and that a one-year-old child should have no more than 10g of free sugars a day.",
      "Free sugars occur when fruit is pureed, as is the case with the pouches. Unlike eating fresh fruit - which is much better for a child - pureeing releases sugar from inside fruit cell walls and can be absorbed much more quickly.",
      "A recent British Dental Association (BDA) report, shared exclusively with the BBC, indicated that 37 of 60 fruit pouches found on supermarket shelves contained more free sugar than this 10g guideline.",
      "The NHS says eating too many free sugars can also lead to weight gain.",
      "Children who are \"barely out of weaning\" are coming to hospital for multiple tooth extractions because of tooth decay caused by their diets, said Eddie Crouch, BDA chair.",
      "\"It's obviously not all down to these pouches,\" he added. \"But clearly, regular use and feeding with these pouches with such high levels of sugar cause serious problems to the general health of children as they're growing up.\"",
      "Some pouches contain higher levels of sugar than some fizzy drinks. The highest found by the BBC was Ella's Kitchen's Bananas and Apples, which has 19.6g of sugar - equivalent to more than four teaspoons.",
      "At the same time, Ella's Kitchen - as well as Lidl, Aldi, Piccolo and Heinz - label their products as containing \"no added sugar\".",
      "While such claims are truthful and not breaking any guidelines, Mr Crouch believes \"the wording itself is intended to mislead\".",
      "Piccolo said it develops \"recipes that combine fruits with vegetables\" to reduce sugar levels, while Ella's Kitchen said that, \"the sugar content would be the same if you pureed the ingredients yourself at home\" and that it has \"a dedicated sugar reduction pathway for 2025\".",
      "Heinz, Aldi, Little Freddie and Lidl all said their products contained \"no added sugars\".",
      "Vitamin C lost",
      "The BBC found that nearly all the vitamin C in one of the fruit pouches tested had been lost during the manufacturing process.",
      "Vitamin C is important for immune systems and an infant needs 25mg a day, the government says. But the Pure Mango pouch from Piccolo had, in effect, no vitamin C left - less than 0.1mg. This is despite the same amount of fresh mango (70g) containing 18.2mg of vitamin C.",
      "\"That is a huge surprise for me,\" said paediatric dietitian Ms Van de Bor. What's left is \"free sugars, sadly, and fluids\", she said, plus a \"small amount\" of fibre.",
      "Vitamin C is heat sensitive, which means it degrades because the food inside pouches is heated to ensure safety and increase shelf life.",
      "We tested three separate production batches of the mango pouch, and all came back with the same result.",
      "However, not all the pouches had low results. Heinz's Apple pouch - which has vitamin C added - and Ella's Kitchen's Bananas pouch tested high in vitamin C.",
      "Piccolo said vitamins degrade during processing, so it boosts many of its fruit pouches with ingredients rich in vitamin C. Ella's Kitchen said it keeps the loss of vitamin C to a minimum.",
      "None of the other brands commented directly on our vitamin C results.",
      "Ignoring expert guidance",
      "We also found that the six companies had failed to implement some NHS, Public Health England and WHO recommendations.",
      "Piccolo, Aldi and Ella's Kitchen currently promote their fruit pouches to babies as young as four months, despite the NHS and WHO saying babies should not be given solid food until about the age of six months.",
      "Introducing products at four months old, added Dr Tedstone, is \"a whole eight weeks of extra product sales\".",
      "\"I think we should put our babies' health ahead of commercial incentives to sell more product,\" she said.",
      "Dr Kremlin Wickramasinghe from the World Health Organization (WHO) told the BBC that companies promoting foods to parents of four-month-olds were acting \"against the best interest of the babies\".",
      "Companies are now making changes to the age recommendations on their products. Since we began our investigation Ella's Kitchen has announced that by March next year it will only recommend pouches for babies older than six months to align with UK guidance. Piccolo told us it has begun relabelling all four-month packets to six-months. And since we contacted Aldi, it has said it will make that change too, \"in line with other brands and retailers\".",
      "Babies should not feed from the spout",
      "Baby food pouches are topped off with a little spout, but both the NHS and the World Health Organization say it should not be used to suck directly from the pouch. It means babies can eat too fast and it can cause dental decay.",
      "None of the companies we looked at used front-of-pack labelling to advise parents against feeding children directly from the spout, despite this being a Public Health England recommendation made in 2019.",
      "We also found that Piccolo was promoting the \"convenience\" of eating directly from the pouch on its website, which said: \"There is no need for extra utensils because food pouches can be squeezed right into a baby's mouth.\"",
      "Since the BBC contacted the company, this has been removed - but the brand does have multiple videos on social media showing children eating from pouches through the spout.",
      "Piccolo didn't respond when asked about its social media images.",
      "All the other brands say their labelling - on the back of pouches - either recommends parents use a spoon, or to not let babies eat directly from the spout.",
      "'We need to protect our babies'",
      "Mandatory legislation is what is needed, said Dr Tedstone and the WHO's Dr Wickramasinghe.",
      "The current UK regulations that cover baby food were written in 2003, before baby food pouches came to market. They provide some guidelines for labelling, prohibit the use of pesticides and set out the minimum and maximum levels of some nutrients. But campaigners say they are outdated and do not ensure products are nutritionally appropriate or stop them being promoted to four month olds.",
      "\"I would hope that ministers, when they think about the baby food industry, recognise that we need to protect our babies,\" said Dr Tedstone.",
      "\"[Businesses] are not going to [change] unless they are forced to.\"",
      "Lidl said it welcomed clear government guidelines, while Little Freddie said it actively participated in policy consultations. Ella's Kitchen said it would \"never, ever\" put profit above the health of children.",
      "Voluntary guidelines for manufacturers aimed at improving standards were drawn up for the government by Public Health England in 2020, but haven't been published by either the Conservative or Labour administrations.",
      "Existing laws already ensure that the safety and quality of baby foods and the claims made on packaging are clear and accurate, the Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC.",
      "It added that it was \"committed to tackling the childhood obesity crisis and improving children's health through our Plan for Change\".",
      "Brands, said Dr Wickramasinghe \"will always come up with the argument why we shouldn't introduce these regulations.\"",
      "\"But we never really quantify the cost [of inaction] to the children... and to the NHS.\""

    "story": [
      "Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut.",
      "Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.",
      "\"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\"",
      "His voice tails off, full of emotion.",
      "\"I thought I was going to die.\"",
      "Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.",
      "\"I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,\" Chris says.",
      "But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt \"like boiling water had been poured over me\".",
      "Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.",
      "As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.",
      "An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.",
      "Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.",
      "Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\".",
      "Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.",
      "Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.",
      "As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.",
      "It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.",
      "Despite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up.",
      "From milligrams to whole nuts",
      "Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.",
      "By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.",
      "Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\".",
      "\"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.",
      "\"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\"",
      "The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.",
      "\"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"",
      "This trial, published in the journal Allergy, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.",
      "Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.",
      "\"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"",
      "But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.",
      "\"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\"",
      "However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.",
      "'Wonderful feeling'",
      "Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.",
      "\"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\"",
      "Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.",
      "How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.",
      "And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.",
      "Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay \u2013 as recommended by his doctors.",
      "He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.",
      "While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life.",

      "Any offender sentenced to more than a year in prison, as well as terrorists and war criminals, can currently be refused asylum and deported under the Refugee Convention.",
      "The government want to widen the scope to include anyone convicted of a crime that would see them put on the sex offenders register in the UK, regardless of the length of their sentence.",

      "Nearly 42,000 UK asylum seekers waiting on appeal",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Cooper said ministers would move to classify sex offences as a \"particularly serious crime\" - enabling the government to reject the asylum applications of sex offenders.",
      "Cooper also called for \"stronger\" rules to stop judges blocking the deportation of migrants on human rights grounds, suggesting there could be a new \"framework\" set by Parliament in future, although she did not provide details.",
      "The government is currently reviewing how the right to a family life contained in Article 8 in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is applied in immigration cases, with an update expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Article 8 has been used by some migrants and asylum seekers to successfully appeal deportation.",
      "Asked about the issue on Radio 4's Today Programme, Cooper she had \"concerns about some of the individual cases\" where the government \"disagreed\" with decisions made in the courts.",
      "\"Respect for family life is supposed to be balanced against other issues, including against the public interest, including against the ability for a government to set its own policies, for Parliament to set policies, and for respect for border security and control,\" she added.",
      "It is not clear how many cases the change could affect.",
      "The planned crackdown would apply to those committing an offence that places them on the sex offenders register in the UK.",

      "Under sentencing guidelines, most sexual crimes in England and Wales carry recommended prison terms beyond a year.",
      "But first-time offenders and less serious examples of sexual assaults, exposure, and sexual communication with a child could lead to custodial sentences of under 12 months.",

      "Ezedi killed himself within hours after he was suspected of dousing his ex-girlfriend with a corrosive liquid when he attacked her and her children in south London in January last year.",
      "He was already on the sex offenders register, after pleading guilty to charges of sexual assault and exposure in 2018, when he was granted asylum in 2020 following two failed attempts.",

      "\"The Conservatives had already tabled tough, clear reforms to remove all foreign criminals and to disapply the Human Rights Act so activists and lawyers cannot block deportations.",
      "\"But Labour voted against our measures - they are not serious about controlling our borders.\"",

      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",

      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",

      "Home Office minister Jess Phillips has said she expects there will be more local inquiries into grooming gangs than the five already announced.",
      "Phillips said she would provide more details about the local inquiries once an audit into the scale and nature of the problem is published.",
      "Baroness Louise Casey's audit, which had been due to finish in mid-April, will be released \"later in May\", Phillips said.",
      "She added that she did not yet know \"what Baroness Casey will say about which particular area\" but would act on the facts.",
      "Conservative Chris Philp said the inquiries, which would not be able to compel people to give evidence, \"just won't do\" and repeated his call for a national inquiry.",
      "The shadow home secretary also asked the minister how she would force councils to hold an inquiry, in cases where the local authorities were unwilling to do so, citing Bradford council as an example.",
      "Earlier this year, Bradford Councils' Safeguarding Children Partnership said a new inquiry was \"unlikely to provide us with any new learnings\" having held an independent review in 2021.",
      "Robbie Moore, a Conservative MP for Keighley and Ilkley, accused Bradford Councils of avoiding commissioning a new inquiry for \"fear of unearthing a very significant problem\".",
      "In reply, Phillips told the MP that, if Baroness Casey identified problems with particular local authorities, \"he has my guarantee, I will pursue them\".",
      "Funds raised for legal action over abuse failings",
      "Local grooming gang reviews will go ahead, says Cooper",
      "For more than a decade there has been a series of high-profile cases where groups of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, were convicted of sexually abusing and raping mainly white girls in the UK.",
      "In 2022, Prof Alexis Jay published the conclusions of a seven-year national inquiry into child sexual abuse, which investigated abuse in churches and schools, as well as by grooming gangs.",
      "Interest around the subject was re-ignited at the start of the year when tech billionaire Elon Musk began calling for a second national inquiry into the scandal - a proposal that was backed by opposition MPs, as well as some Labour ones.",
      "In January, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stopped short of holding such an inquiry but instead announced the audit of the current scale and nature of gang based exploitation.",
      "She also said \u00a35m would be available for \"victim-centred locally-led inquiries\" in Oldham and four other areas, which have not yet been named.",
      "She added that Tom Crowther KC, who led an inquiry in Telford, would help the government develop a new framework for the five local investigations that could be used as a model in other areas.",
      "However, last month Crowther expressed uncertainty about his role and told a committee of MPs that he had asked the Home Office \"do you still want me?\"",
      "On Monday, Phillips said the government was \"moving ahead\" with its commitment for the five inquiries and would focus on \"delivering meaningful, tangible change\".",
      "Karen Bradley, Conservative MP and chairwoman of the Home Affairs Committee, asked when the government would announce the locations for the local inquiries and how the minister would \"ensure that councils that are reluctant to be part of this are compelled to do so\".",

      "She said the framework for inquiries would be released later in May, when Baroness Casey's review would also be published.",

      "The government has ruled out any extra cash for pay rises after review bodies recommended new deals for teachers and NHS staff above the amount budgeted for by ministers, Downing Street has said.",
      "The pay review body for teachers in England has recommended a pay rise of about 4% this year, while its NHS equivalent has recommended about 3%, according to figures first reported by The Times.",
      "Both figures are higher than the 2.8% the government had budgeted for in their proposals to the pay bodies, and are likely to place further strain on public finances.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government would look at the pay proposals \"and respond in due course\".",

      "Government recommends 2.8% pay rise for public sector",

      "Sir Keir has cited ending strikes as a key part of his plan to improve the NHS, arguing it is one of the reasons waiting lists have been falling for the past six months.",

      "The government could reject the pay recommendations and stick to 2.8%.",
      "But it is more likely that ministers say the higher pay will have to be funded by existing budgets and efficiency savings.",
      "That would set ministers on a collision course with trade unions and - government insiders privately concede - make a new wave of strikes possible.",
      "Teaching unions NASUWT and National Education Union, which together represent the bulk of England's teaching workforce, have already threatened strikes if pay rises trigger cuts or layoffs.",
      "National Education Union general secretary Daniel Kebede said: \"They need to ensure the pay award is above inflation, that it takes steps to address the crisis in recruitment and retention, but most of all that it is fully funded.\"",
      "The British Medical Association (BMA) has previously said the government's approach \"indicates a poor grasp of the unresolved issues from two years of industrial action\".",
      "Health Minster Stephen Kinnock told Sky News: \"We are all about putting more money into the pockets of working people, but we do also have to ensure that we are balancing the books, and we have got to work in terms of public sector pay within fiscal constraints.",
      "\"We will give these recommendations careful consideration.",
      "\"But I would, of course, also urge our colleagues in the trade union movement to engage constructively with us and recognise the reality of the financial position.\"",
      "Director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies Paul Johnson said the government will face \"tough\" trade-offs when considering how to award pay.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set \"very, very tight budgets\" so any pay increase risks the government being \"forced into tax rises or other spending cuts\", Johnson said.",
      "Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Johnson said: \"If you're increasing pay then you can't do other things.",
      "\"You can't employ more teachers or open breakfast clubs or have more doctors and nurses.\"",
      "Public anger over pay, squeezed public services and potential strikes could play a major role in local elections this week - the government's first major test since last year's landslide general election victory.",
      "Sir Keir is spending Monday touring hospitals promoting reforms to the NHS app - which he said will haul the health service out of the \"dark ages\", saving it money and cutting waiting lists.",
      "The salaries of NHS staff, as well as other public-sector workers such as police officers, teachers and the members of the armed forces, are recommended by eight pay review bodies (PRBs).",
      "They cover 2.5 million workers - about 45% of public-sector staff - and a pay bill of around \u00a3100bn.",
      "The PRBs are made up of economists and experts on human resources, with experience in both the public and private sector and are appointed by the relevant government department.",
      "The independent pay review bodies take overall earnings, both public and private sector, and the forecast rate of inflation into account when they make their recommendations.",

      "In a report, due to be presented by Sir Mark Rowley to the London Policing Board this week, he says the force \"must be honest to Londoners that in light of the budget, we are shrinking as an organisation\".",
      "The commissioner acknowledges that extra funding from the Home Office and City Hall means the Met's final settlement is \"nearly \u00a3100m better\" than it feared in November 2024, when he warned of a \u00a3450m funding gap and \"eye-watering cuts\" to services.",
      "The Home Office has been asked to comment.",
      "Sir Mark says unless the Met receives more money in June's spending review, the government risks being unable to meet its own national promises to halve knife crime, and violence against women and girls, over the next decade.",

      "The commissioner's report states the force wants to grow in size to 38,000 officers and 19,000 staff, but is forecast to have just 31,248 officers and 10,972 staff by the end of the year.",
      "He predicts the Met will lose about 1,700 officers, PCSOs and staff, but that additional funding may allow the force to reduce the losses by speeding up recruitment.",

      "\"We will have less policing capacity and capability at a time when demand has been steadily increasing,\" the commissioner writes.",
      "\"Undoubtedly this will impact our ability to respond to victims of crime and Londoners and have consequences for our own officers and staff and our reform plans.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Met detailed a list of savings it would need to make in order to protect frontline services such as neighbourhood policing and public protection teams, which tackle sex offences and domestic abuse.",
      "Those plans include scrapping the Royal Parks police and Safer Schools officers, along with cuts to forensics and mounted police, and potentially taking firearms off the Flying Squad.",

      "Over 300 quango bosses received a higher salary than the prime minister last year, according to the TaxPayers' Alliance (TPA).",
      "Quango stands for quasi autonomous non-governmental organisations, which means they are taxpayer-funded but not directly controlled by central government, and include watchdogs as well as the prison service.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer axed the biggest quango, NHS England, last month and the government is currently reviewing hundreds of quangos in a bid to reduce bureaucratic waste and inefficiency.",
      "John O'Connell, chief executive of the TPA, said there should be more scrutiny of the hundreds of \"quangocrats\" taking home \"massive pay packets\" with minimal democratic oversight.",

      "He said: \"Taxpayers will be shocked to hear that there are hundreds of quangocrats heading up bodies they may never have heard taking home massive pay packets the average Brit can only dream of.",
      "\"But beyond the healthy remuneration, arguably the bigger problem is that in many areas of government policy these quango bosses reign supreme, with minimal ministerial or parliamentary oversight despite the often highly sensitive and significant nature of what their organisation is responsible for.",
      "\"The government may have signalled an intent to get a grip of the quango state, but as well as restoring political accountability there needs to be serious review of some of the functions they perform.\"",
      "However, Matthew Gill, the Institute for Government's programme director on public bodies, said focusing on the pay of quango bosses could be misleading.",
      "\"It is important that public bodies are democratically accountable, but ministers cannot micro-manage everything in the public sector,\" he said.",
      "\"They need good people running things \u2013 and pay that is too low to attract them is a false economy.",
      "\"It is very difficult to evaluate whether public sector leaders are paid appropriately without benchmarking their pay to the private sector.\"",
      "Under Sir Keir, the Labour government has set up more than 20 new quangos, including Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals; and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with \u00a3353.3bn budgeted for them in 2022/23, according to the latest published figures.",
      "The last major shake-up was under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, when a \"bonfire of the quangos\" scrapped nearly a third of them, including the Audit Commission and the UK Film Council.",
      "Asked last month if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",

      "The government claims parents will save around \u00a350 per child through the school uniform measures, which it hopes to introduce in September 2026.",
      "But uniform retailers warn that the planned changes might increase costs for families. The Schoolwear Association says the plans could mean parents spend more on replacing lower-quality generic garments which might not last as long as branded items.",

    "story": [
      "Interim guidance on single-sex spaces is \"ill-considered and impractical\" and should be withdrawn, the Green Party has said.",
      "The guidance, issued by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), followed the UK Supreme Court's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act.",
      "In places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use women's facilities but they should not be left with no facilities to use, the guidance says.",
      "Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer told the BBC the guidance puts trans people at risk of discrimination, while Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said there were questions over how it would be enforced.",
      "Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden said the \"logical consequence\" of the Supreme Court ruling and EHRC guidance was that \"people use the facilities of their biological sex\".",
      "Asked if the government would ban trans people from using changing rooms or toilets they wish to use in its own buildings, he told the BBC: \"In reality, when you say ban, am I going to be standing outside toilets?  I'm probably not.",
      "\"There isn't going to be toilet police but that is the logical consequence of the court ruling and the EHRC guidance.\"",
      "The UK government has welcomed the Supreme Court ruling, saying it brings \"clarity\" for women and service providers.",
      "A spokesperson added: \"We will review and update policy wherever necessary to ensure it complies with the latest legal requirements.\"",
      "Last week the Supreme Court found the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "As part of the judgement in the case brought against Scottish ministers by the group For Women Scotland, Supreme Court judge Lord Hodge stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",

      "Carla Denyer, co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, said the interim guidance, which was published on Friday following the Supreme Court ruling on 15 April, was \"rushed and ill-thought out\".",
      "\"It's been really obvious that they have not listened to trans people,\" she told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.",
      "She added that the guidance put trans people at risk of discrimination, especially in workplaces, and \"seems to fly in face of the strong tradition of tolerance we have in Britain\".",
      "The Green Party said in a statement that the guidance was likely to cause \"distress\" to the trans community as well as \"further confusion to employers, businesses and service providers\" .",
      "It is calling for the guidance to be withdrawn \"until the EHRC can produce something more thought-through which takes into account the voices of all those affected\".",
      "Denyer questioned what should happen if trans people are not allowed to go to the toilet of their gender or their birth sex.",
      "The guidance also states that in some circumstances the law allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use women's facilities.",
      "When asked to clarify this, the EHRC pointed to a section of the Supreme Court ruling stating that trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken\" in the context of a women-only service.",
      "However, the guidance says where possible mixed-sex toilets or changing facilities should be provided, with lockable rooms intended to be used by one person at a time, in addition to single-sex facilities.",
      "Denyer also raised concerns that for lesbian associations or venues which wanted to include trans women, the advice appeared to say they would not be allowed to.",
      "The guidance states that \"a women-only or lesbian-only association should not admit trans women (biological men)\", while \"a men-only or gay men-only associations should not admit trans men (biological women)\".",
      "Sir Ed also told the programme lots of people were confused and anxious about the guidance, for example over which toilet a trans man (biological woman) should use.",
      "The Lib Dem leader said his party accepted the Supreme Court ruling but there needed to be more debate in Parliament to reach a clear solution that \"respects people's rights\".",
      "The EHRC, which enforces equalities law and provides guidance to policymakers, public sector bodies and businesses, is expected to launch a two-week consultation to seek views from those affected in May.",
      "The watchdog is then aiming to provide an updated code of practice to the government for ministerial approval by the end of June.",
      "A spokesperson for the EHRC said: \"The law is as set out in the Supreme Court's very readable judgment and is effective immediately.",
      "\"Employers, service providers and others with duties under the Equality Act must follow the law and should take appropriate specialist legal advice where necessary.",
      "\"But we know many people have questions about the consequences of the judgment and what it means for them, which is why we issued this [guidance] in the interim.\"",
      "The spokesperson added: \"We remain committed to promoting equality and tackling discrimination in all its forms.\"",

      "But an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation. Downing Street declined to repeat its previous opposition to reporters on Thursday, saying it would not provide a \"running commentary\" on talks.",

      "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
      "EU chief 'surprised' at fish status in Brexit talks",

      "Speaking at UK Trade and Business Commission meeting on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a \"package approach\" to the talks, where different topics are linked together.",
      "He added that EU citizens had faced \"many obstacles\" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including \"very high thresholds\" for skilled work visas.",
      "Existing schemes",
      "The UK currently offers visas allowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.",
      "These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.",
      "Applicants from these countries need at least \u00a32,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of \u00a3776 for students and \u00a31,035 for workers.",
      "The European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth deal in April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking \"differential treatment\" of EU citizens.",
      "Under its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued.",
      "It also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit.",
      "'Youth experience'",
      "There have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap.",
      "Asked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that \"we have to leave that to the negotiations\".",
      "The EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa.",
      "Documents circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a \"youth experience\" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration.",
      "But any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement.",
      "During a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked \"another avenue which people might use to game the system,\" adding that Labour \"doesn't know how to negotiate\".",
      "She added: \"Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?\"",
      "Reform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a \"huge number of people\" coming to the UK, adding it would be \"completely against what the Brexit vote demanded\".",
      "An agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU.",
      "In his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have \"nothing to do with migration\" as those taking part in the scheme would \"go home\" once their visa has ended."

      "The light which sits above the Big Ben bell at the top of the Elizabeth Tower, was switched off at the outbreak of war in 1939 to comply with blackout regulations.",
      "The rules were aimed at reducing any light which could help Germany bombers find their targets.",
      "In 1945, then Commons Speaker Col Clifton Brown interrupted a parliamentary debate to tell MPs that after five years, seven months and 23 days, he was turning the light back on.",
      "Addressing the Commons, Clifton Brown said: \"I pray that with God's blessing, this light will shine henceforth not only as an outward and visible sign that the Parliament of a free people is assembled in free debate, but also that it may shine as a beacon of sure hope in a sadly torn and distracted world.'",

    "summary": "The British Hair Consortium is calling on Rachel Reeves to cut VAT to 10% in June's spending review.",
    "story": [
      "\"I never wanted to do anything else but be a hairdresser,\" said Kerry Larcher, who opened her first salon when she was 21-years-old.",
      "Despite successfully growing her business in Hornchurch, in East London, over three decades, the 50-year-old says she now faces losing her life's work and her home.",
      "Tax rises in October's Budget are \"crippling\" her salon business, she said, and the extra \u00a323,000 a year imposed by the chancellor could prove the final nail in the coffin.",
      "\"I have been crying myself to sleep because, since October, this has been the worst period of my personal life in 30 years,\" she said.",
      "\"I feel ashamed to get into debt but we are gradually eating through our business reserves and I can't take wages if I don't make a profit.",
      "\"I could lose my house if the business folds - that is the reality and if things don't change it is frightening the life out of me.\"",
      "'I don't have the margin to invest in apprentices'",
      "'Perfect storm' could see end of salon apprenticeships",
      "'We're always hammered' - Beauty industry ahead of budget",
      "The government says the tax changes announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves were needed to stabilise the economy.",
      "They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27.",
      "But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses.",
      "Cutting a client's hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum.",
      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from \u00a37,576 to \u00a318,482 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",
      "Update 26 April 2025: This article was amended to correct the cost of Kerry's business rates, which she said increased from about \u00a37,000, not from \u00a3700 as we originally stated.",

The Lib Dems reckon with a good night they might control more councils than the Tories this time next week \u2013 whether it's Oxfordshire or Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire or other parts of the South West.",

      "And party sources suggest their activists are more motivated, and their numbers even increasing, because of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Lastly, but not least, the Greens want to continue their steady march into council seats across England.",
      "In 2023 they had their best showing in 20 years and took majority control of a council for the first time, adding many more councillors to their number last year.",
      "This time round they want to add to the tally in counties like Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Kent, where they already have bums on seats.",
      "The Green MPs have made less noise than their other newbie rivals at the other end of the spectrum, Reform. So at a time when enthusiasm for the climate agenda has been fading, or at least evolving in both the big main parties, next week the Green Party will want to show it is a growing force.",

      "For the Conservatives, how much of its once legendary campaigning muscle is left after getting whacked in the summer? Some loyalists are heartened there are still members willing to knock on doors. But a rival campaigner now calls them the \"tumbleweed Tories\", claiming they're nowhere to be seen on the ground.",
      "Both the Lib Dems and the Greens have long been playing effective local ground games, concentrating on building power bases in pockets of the country.",
      "The most acute test perhaps then is for Reform, who have proven time and time again they can make a lot of noise nationally, on air, and increasingly, online.",
      "In five-party politics, many races may be won with a relatively small share of the vote, by tiny margins, that \"sliver here and sliver there\".",
      "These elections are likely to result in real-life evidence of a political idea that's all the rage, that there's \"fragmentation\" among the public, the traditional voting blocs are no more. Excitable columns are already being penned in anticipation, proclaiming that two-party politics is dead.",
      "The splitting of the vote among so many groups also seems likely to leave more councils without any a clear majority.",
      "In that case, they go into what's known as \"no overall control\", so the biggest party needs votes from the others to get their way.",
      "It's likely that will pose the Conservatives with a tricky real-life question after many weeks of troublesome hypothetical arguments: will they, or won't they, work with their arch rivals Reform UK on the ground?",
      "Crucially, if Reform makes its expected big advances, it will for the first time have responsibility for decisions that affect people's lives.  That will be a big achievement.",
      "Both senior Labour and Conservative sources agree privately, as one said, \"the biggest thing to come out of Thursday night is that Reform will have a record to defend\".",
      "Next week the smaller parties are on track to have plenty to celebrate.  If the General Election was branded the \"ABC election \u2013 Anyone But the Conservatives\", maybe next week's ballots will be branded the \"ABB election \u2013 Anyone But the Big parties\".",

    "story": [
      "In nearly 25 years in daily journalism, I have never known another issue quite like it.",
      "The arguments over sex and gender, trans and women's rights have a passion, an anger and often a toxicity on both sides greater in their intensity than those over the Iraq war two decades ago, or Brexit in more recent years.",
      "The abuse and vitriol that fly into my inbox every time I report on it are really quite something.",
      "Last week's decision by the Supreme Court was a landmark moment in this debate, providing the prism through which arguments will now be conducted.",
      "But it won't mark an end to those arguments, as a debate in the Commons on Tuesday evening proved.",
      "The Conservative benches were packed and the Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch, took the unusual decision to answer for her party herself, something she would normally do in response to a statement from the prime minister rather than any other minister.",
      "It was clear why she wanted to do so, displaying a greater confidence and sense of self-assurance than at any point since she became Conservative leader last autumn.",
      "Some of her own MPs have grumbled privately that she has lacked oomph and cut-through in her opening months in the job.",
      "She wasn't lacking oomph this time, arguing the Supreme Court had vindicated what she had long argued, and pretty much saying \"I told you so\" to the Labour Party.",
      "And yes, Labour in recent years, from Sir Keir Starmer down, have been in something of a bind on this issue, frequently tangled in anguish when confronted by questions such as \"Can a woman have a penis?\"",
      "Many senior Labour figures regarded such questions as reductive and trivialising and wanted to be openly thoughtful about the rights of trans people.",
      "They maintain, as do the Conservatives, that they still are, but it is also true that the Labour leadership's position is the opposite of what it was.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision prompts lots of questions about the practicalities of what it concluded \u2013 for organisations large and small, public and private, trans people and others.",

    "story": [
      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 26 Apr 2025 23:07:39 GMT",
    "summary": "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and April created ideal conditions for wildfires to spread.",
    "story": [
      "The area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade, satellite data suggests.",
      "More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012.",
      "That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019.",
      "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers.",
      "Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly.",
      "The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels.",
      "The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km).",
      "More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year.",
      "Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly.",
      "\"We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,\" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office.",
      "\"This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.\"",
      "A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires.",
      "\"The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,\" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London.",
      "\"Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.\"",
      "The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record.",
      "The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year.",
      "In Galloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total.",
      "A fire in mid-Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km.",
      "Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April.",
      "These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.",
      "Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.",
      "Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.",
      "Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.",
      "\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".",
      "\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"",
      "The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.",
      "But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.",
      "A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.",
      "Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.",
      "\"One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,\" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh.",

      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

    "summary": "The UK Energy Secretary was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security.",
    "story": [
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.",
      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",
      "In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.",
      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",
      "\"As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,\" he added.",
      "Miliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.",
      "\"As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,\" King Charles wrote.",
      "The UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade - currently this stands around 60%.",
      "Miliband told the BBC's R4 Today programme that this would guarantee lower energy bills by 2030.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xz664r2do",
    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:00:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

    "story": [
      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action.

A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

    "summary": "The UK Energy Secretary was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security.",
    "story": [
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.",
      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",
      "In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.",
      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",
      "\"As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,\" he added.",
      "Miliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.",
      "\"As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,\" King Charles wrote.",
      "The UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade - currently this stands around 60%.",
      "Miliband told the BBC's R4 Today programme that this would guarantee lower energy bills by 2030.",
      "Miliband accuses net zero opponents of 'nonsense and lies'",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:00:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

    "summary": "Skeletons and artefacts unearthed from the site near Cardiff Airport are baffling archaeologists.",
    "story": [
      "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.",
      "The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.",
      "Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.",
      "Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.",
      "\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.",
      "About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.",
      "So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.",
      "\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\"",
      "The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.",
      "\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.",
      "\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"",
      "Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.",
      "Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.",
      "\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"",
      "The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.",
      "The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.",
      "They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.",
      "Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s.",
      "Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.",
      "Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.",
      "The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.",
      "Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.",
      "The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.",
      "Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.",
      "\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.",
      "\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"",
      "The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.",
      "Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.",
      "\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.",
      "\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"",

      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence.

In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

      "The Meta AI logo is an ever-present blue circle with pink and green splashes in the bottom right of your Chats screen.",
      "Interacting with it opens a chatbot designed to answer your questions, but it has drawn attention and frustration from users who cannot remove it from the app.",
      "It follows Microsoft's Recall feature, which was an always-on tool - before the firm faced a backlash and decided to allow people to disable it.",
      "\"We think giving people these options is a good thing and we're always listening to feedback from our users,\" WhatsApp told the BBC.",
      "The company likens the feature to other permanent options in the app like 'channels' and 'status'.",

      "\"No one should be forced to use AI,\" he told the BBC.",

      "On Tuesday, Tesla reported a 20% drop in car sales for the first three months of the year, compared with the same period last year, while profits fell more than 70%.",

      "Trump's tariffs on China also weighed heavily on Tesla. Although the vehicles Tesla sells in its home market are assembled in the US, it depends on many parts made in China. \"Rapidly evolving trade policy\" could hurt its supply chain and raise costs, according to the company.",
      "\"This dynamic, along with changing political sentiment, could have a meaningful impact on demand for our products in the near-term,\" Tesla's quarterly update said.",
      "Musk has clashed on trade with other Trump administration figures, including trade adviser Peter Navarro.",
      "On Tuesday, Musk said he thought Tesla was the car company least affected by tariffs because of its localised supply chains in North America, Europe and China, but he added that tariffs were \"still tough on a company where margins are low\".",
      "\"I'll continue to advocate for lower tariffs rather than higher tariffs but that's all I can do,\" he said.",

The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country deserves respect from the US and will only enter trade and security talks with President Donald Trump \"on our terms\".",
      "Speaking exclusively to the BBC as the polls were closing, Carney said he would only visit Washington when there was a \"serious discussion to be had\" that respected Canada's sovereignty.",
      "Since Trump's re-election to the White House, the US president has repeatedly mentioned making Canada the \"51st state\" of America, and this was reiterated by the White House on Tuesday.",
      "\"The election does not affect President Trump's plan to make Canada America's cherished 51st state,\" White House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly said.",
      "Carney, who secured a historic victory for his Liberal Party in a snap election on Monday, said such a scenario was \"never, ever going to happen\".",
      "\"Frankly, I don't think it's ever going to happen with respect to any other [country]... whether it's Panama or Greenland or elsewhere,\" he added.",
      "However, he said there was a \"win-win possibility\" for his country if it could secure a deal with the US and also build on trading relationships with the European Union and the UK.",
      "Strained US relations",
      "The US is a big market for Canadian businesses with roughly 75% of Canada's exports heading south.",
      "Canada accounts for a much smaller 17% of US exports.",
      "Canada is also America's largest foreign supplier of crude oil. America's trade deficit with Canada - expected to be $45bn in 2024 - was mostly driven by US energy demands.",
      "Canada and US relations have been strained in recent months, driven by Trump's talk of a \"51st state\" and referring to previous Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as \"governor\" - the title for leaders of individual American states.",
      "The US president has also sparked a global trade war in which Canada was one of the first countries targeted with tariffs.",
      "Trump has partially imposed a blanket 25% tariff on various Canadian goods, along with 25% import taxes on all aluminium and steel imports, but has exempted products covered by a US, Canada and Mexico trade deal known as USMCA.",
      "Canada has retaliated with some C$60bn ($42bn; \u00a332bn) worth of tariffs on US goods.",
      "Carney said talks with Trump would be \"on our terms, not on their terms\".",
      "\"There is a partnership to be had, an economic and security partnership,\" he said.",
      "\"It's going to be a very different one than we've had in the past.\"",
      "Live coverage: Carney celebrates historic win in Canada",
      "Analysis: Carney will lead an 'everything but Trump' coalition",
      "Who is Mark Carney, Canada's new PM?",
      "Carney has touted his experience handling global economic crises as a way to deal with Trump on tariffs.",
      "Before becoming PM in early March, Carney had never held political office.",
      "He is a banker by trade, leading the Bank of Canada during the 2008 global financial crisis before becoming the first non-British person to take on the top job at the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020.",
      "The PM said Canada was the \"biggest client for more than 40 states\" in the US.",
      "\"Remember that we supply them [the US] with vital energy. Remember that we supply their farmers with basically all their fertiliser,\" Carney told the BBC.",
      "\"We deserve respect. We expect respect and I'm sure we'll get it in due course again, and then we can have these discussions.\"",
      "Canada and the US, along with Mexico, have deeply integrated economies, with billions of pounds worth of manufactured goods crossing the borders on a daily basis, for example, car parts.",
      "The introduction of tariffs, which are taxes levied on goods as they enter a country and paid for by the importer, threatens decades of collaborations between the nations.",
      "Trump has argued tariffs will encourage more Americans to buy domestically-made goods, which will ultimately boost US manufacturing and jobs.",
      "Trade with allies being 'put to the test'",
      "While America's main opponent in the global trade conflict is China, the introduction of Trump's blanket, so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on the likes of the UK and other European countries has led to allies seeking fresh agreements in response to barriers to trading with the world's largest economy.",
      "Carney, who endorsed UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves during the British general election, said \"one would think\" that Canada and the UK could sign a stalled free trade agreement as part of diversifying trade, but highlighted about 95% of trade between the countries is effectively tariff-free already.",
      "\"We could expand the level of integration between our countries, like-minded countries. You think about defence partnerships, and those conversations have just just begun, so there's a lot that we can do,\" he added.",
      "In a statement congratulating Carney, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"I know we will continue to work closely on defence, security, trade and investment.\"",
      "Carney said the G7 summit hosted by Canada in June would be \"very important\" in deciding the future path of the global trade war, adding it would \"put to the test\" whether the group of the world's seven most advanced economies - which includes the US - was still the most \"like-minded of like-minded countries\".",
      "The summit will occur just before the 90-day pause on some of Trump's higher tariffs is set to expire."

    "story": [
      "The trial has begun of 10 people who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at a Paris hotel in 2016.",
      "The reality TV star and business woman was tied up and held at gunpoint in a luxury suite where she was staying during Paris Fashion Week.",
      "About $10m (\u00a37.5m) worth of jewels were taken from her, including a $4m (\u00a32.9m) diamond engagement from then-husband Kanye West.",
      "In a grand courtroom adorned with 19th Century tapestries, the court was given a fascinating snapshot into the lives of the diverse cast of characters suspected of involvement in the heist.",
      "For the first one up - 71-year-old Yunice Abbas - this was done through a \"enqu\u00eate de personnalit\u00e9\", a sort of background report on a person accused of a crime which French courts regularly include in their trials. These reports take in elements of the defendant's family history, behaviour and work to paint a picture of their lives and help jurors make a decision.",
      "The court heard a long list of crimes that Abbas has been found guilty of in the past - from petty crime and small-time drug trafficking to bank robberies - and retraced his difficult childhood, which was partly spent in Algeria and marked by the deaths of two of his siblings.",
      "Abbas - who has spent almost a third of his life in jail - has already admitted to his role in the heist, and even wrote a memoir entitled I Held Up Kim Kardashian. The president of the court, David De Pas, suggested that the book shows Abbas was proud of what he did - something he has repeatedly denied.",
      "When asked if he had any sympathy for his victims, Abbas said that he never did before the Kardashian heist, \"but this time I do regret what I did\u2026 It opened my eyes.\"",
      "Abbas said that while watching television in jail, he was confronted with relentless coverage of the burglary, which made him realise how much Kim Kardashian had suffered.",
      "\"We just grabbed the lady's handbag but I have discovered there's trauma behind it,\" he said.",
      "The court also focused on Gary Madar, whose brother's company provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for several years. Now 35, the father-of-two has been accused of feeding information to the gang about Kim Kardashian's location on the night of the heist.",
      "At the time, Gary worked as a customer service agent in airports for the transport company. His task was to welcome VIPs arriving at Paris airports and escort them through passport and customs checks. Through this job, he met the Kardashians several times.",
      "But he also worked at a caf\u00e9 owned by another defendant, Florus H\u00e9roui, 52, to whom investigators believe Madar passed on information about Kim Kardashian.",
      "He has denied this and his lawyer has told the BBC that Madar should not be on the dock as there is \"no solid proof\" of his involvement.",
      "Marc Boyer, 78, who is accused of supplying the weapon that was used to threaten Kardashian, was also questioned at length. He expressed regret that his son Marc-Alexandre Boyer - also a defendant - had grown up surrounded by \"thieves\" and \"crooks\" who had led him to make the wrong life choices.",
      "The rest of the week will see more defendants take the stand as the trial ticks on towards 13 May - the day Kim Kardashian is expected to testify.",
      "The vast majority of the 400 journalists reporting on this trial are expected to flock to the courthouse that day, and court staff are unsure how they will accommodate so many reporters who will want a front seat.",

      "'Grandpa robbers' held Kim Kardashian at gunpoint - but didn't know who she was",

      "Another, Aomar Ait Khedache, will be up on Wednesday - but he is now nearly deaf and mute and will have to write his answers down on a piece of paper.",
      "The trial is taking place eight and a half years after the heist.",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and author of a book on the robbery, told the BBC that Paris courts were busy with large terrorism trials for several years, which created a backlog.",
      "She also said the long wait had to do with the defendants' age and health issues which meant they spent little time in provisional detention.",
      "\"Once they were freed it felt less urgent for judges to bring this to trial,\" Tourancheau said."

      "\"The results of the occupation's investigation hold the usual fallacious allegations of rescue teams in Gaza being part of Hamas in order to justify the war crime of targeting medical missions in general, and the war crime of attacking teams and vehicles carrying the protected emblems of the Geneva Conventions in particular,\" it said.",
      "A senior UN humanitarian official in Gaza warned \"a lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place\".",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "At least 52,365 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "The ministry says more than 2,270 people have been killed since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages it is still holding.",
      "Palestinian media reported on Tuesday that at least six people were killed in Israeli air and artillery strikes across Gaza City, in the north, including three in the al-Shaaf area.",
      "Another four people were said to have been killed in strikes on tents housing displaced people in the southern al-Mawasi area, near the city of Khan Younis.",
      "Israel has also blocked all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza since 2 March, which the UN says has caused severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.",
      "On Tuesday, the UN's human rights chief urged the world to \"prevent the total collapse of critical life-saving support in Gaza\".",
      "\"Any use of starvation of the civilian population as a method of war constitutes a war crime, and so do all forms of collective punishment,\" Volker T\u00fcrk warned.",
      "The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "But Israel has said it is complying with international law and that there is no shortage of aid because 25,000 lorry loads entered Gaza during the recent ceasefire. It has also accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group has denied."

    "summary": "The escalation in tensions means it could be years before tourism and businesses thrive again in Kashmir.",
    "story": [
      "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.",
      "The main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.",
      "Last Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".",
      "The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.",
      "In the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.",
      "There is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations.",
      "While violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.",
      "Tourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.",
      "At a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.",
      "Other tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.",
      "After a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.",
      "Among those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".",
      "\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.",
      "But uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.",
      "Indian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.",
      "India and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.",
      "The escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.",
      "Indian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.",
      "Top leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.",
      "\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.",
      "The cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.",
      "\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"",
      "The attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.",
      "The timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.",
      "The region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.",
      "\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.",
      "As the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.",
      "In an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.",
      "He said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.",
      "\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?",
      "\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir."

    "story": [
      "At least 68 African migrants have been killed in a US air strike on a detention centre in Houthi-controlled north-western Yemen, the armed group's TV channel says.",
      "Al Masirah reported that another 47 migrants were injured, most of them critically, when the centre in Saada province was bombed. It posted graphic footage showing multiple bodies covered in the rubble of a destroyed building.",
      "A US defence official said the US military's Central Command was aware of the claims of civilian casualties.",
      "The strike came hours after Central Command announced its forces had hit more than 800 targets since President Donald Trump ordered an intensification of the air campaign against the Houthis on 15 March.",
      "It said the strikes had \"killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders\", including senior officials overseeing missile and drone programmes.",
      "Houthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.",
      "Who are the Houthis and why is the US targeting them?",
      "Hundreds of migrants killed by Saudi border guards - report",
      "'We make it or we die'",
      "The migrant detention centre in Saada was reportedly holding 115 Africans when it was hit four times shortly before 05:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Monday, according to Al Masirah.",
      "The casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but Al Masirah's videos showed first responders recovering the bodies of at least a dozen men among pieces of concrete and metal debris on the floor of a large building with partially destroyed walls and no roof.",
      "At a local hospital, another injured man told Al Masirah: \"The strike hit us while we were sleeping, that's it.\"",
      "Following a visit to the scene, the chairman of the Somali community in Yemen,  Ibrahim Cabdulqaadir Macallin, told the BBC: \"It was tragic and horrific... I saw burnt people. We couldn't recognise some of the bodies we saw.\"",
      "He said the number of Somali migrants who were killed was \"very small\" because a group had been removed from the detention centre three days earlier, and that the majority of the detainees were Ethiopians.",
      "He also said that the facility was in an \"open area\" and \"not near any military base\".",
      "The Houthi-run interior ministry condemned what it called the \"deliberate bombing\" of the facility and said it constituted a \"war crime\".",
      "The US defence official said Central Command took the claims of civilian casualties very seriously, and that it was currently conducting a battle-damage assessment and inquiry into them.",
      "The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was \"deeply saddened by the reports of the tragic loss of life in Saada\".",
      "\"While IOM has not been operating at this facility, we remain committed to closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to offer support as needed,\" it added.",
      "\"We call on all parties to the conflict to prioritize the protection of civilians and ensure full respect for international laws.\"",
      "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said teams from the Yemen Red Crescent Society provided lifesaving support by evacuating the wounded to hospitals and were ensuring a dignified management of the dead.",
      "In 2022, at least 66 people were reportedly killed when the Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen's government struck a pre-trial detention facility only 100m (330ft) away from the location of Monday's attack.",
      "Al Masirah also reported that another eight people had been killed in overnight US air strikes in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa.",
      "The statement put out by Centcom late on Sunday said the US had \"intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations\" in order to \"preserve operational security\".",
      "Despite the devastation and humanitarian crisis in Yemen caused by 11 years of conflict, migrants continue to arrive in the country by boat from the Horn of Africa, motivated by political and economic instability, droughts and other extreme weather events in their own countries.",
      "Most of them are intending to cross into neighbouring Saudi Arabia to find work. Instead, they face exploitation, detention, violence, and dangerous journeys through active conflict zones, according to the IOM.",
      "In 2024 alone, it says, almost 60,900 migrants arrived in the country, often with no means to survive. The majority of them are Ethiopians and Somalis.",
      "Thousands of migrants are thought to be held in detention centres like the one in Saada, but there are no official statistics from the Houthi-run authorities. Rights groups say detainees experience dire conditions, including overcrowding, abuse and poor sanitation.",
      "Earlier this month, the Houthi-run government said a series of US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others. It said the terminal was a civilian facility and that the strikes constituted a \"war crime\".",
      "Centcom said the attack destroyed the ability of Ras Isa to accept fuel and that it would \"begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities\".",
      "Last month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be \"completely annihilated\". He also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.",
      "On Sunday, Centcom said it would \"continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region\".",
      "On Monday evening, the Houthis' military spokesman said its forces had retaliated for the US \"aggression and massacres against civilians\" by targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier battle group with \"a number of cruise and ballistic missiles and drones\".",
      "He also said the group had launched a drone towards the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israel's military announced earlier that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen.",
      "Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.",
      "The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.",
      "The Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.",
      "After taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.",
      "Yemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated in 2015 when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.",
      "The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid."

      "A spokesperson for the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen said it was considering the \"next steps\" for the treatment of Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8.",
      "The damage occurred during an \"unguarded moment\", a museum spokesperson told the Dutch media outlet Algemeen Dagblad (AD) last week.",
      "A spokesperson for the museum told the BBC the damage was \"superficial\", adding: \"Small scratches are visible in the unvarnished paint layer in the lower part of the painting\".",

      "\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.",
      "Sophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".",
      "This is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.",

      "Jonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"",
      "\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Restoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.",
      "He said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.",
      "Conservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.",
      "\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Rothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.",
      "Umaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.",
      "During his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.",
      "Rachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".",

      "Rubio told US media that Donald Trump hasn't imposed new penalties on Russia because he still hopes diplomacy can end the war.",
      "It comes after Trump held a brief meeting with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky at the Vatican before Pope Francis' funeral on Saturday.",
      "Updating reporters on Sunday, Trump said he believes Zelensky is willing to give up Crimea to Russia as part of a peace deal - despite Kyiv's previous rejections of any such proposal.",
      "Speaking to NBC's Meet the Press programme, Rubio said: \"There are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic.",
      "\"We're close, but we're not close enough. Throughout this process, it's about determining, do both sides really want peace and how close are they or how far apart they are after 90 days of effort here... that's what we're trying to determine this week.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:20:37 GMT",
    "summary": "The Spanish grid operator said the preliminary assessment suggests there was no cyber attack.",
    "story": [
      "The Spanish grid operator has ruled out a cyber attack as the cause of a massive power cut that crippled Spain, Portugal and parts of France on Monday.",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica's operations director Eduardo Prieto said preliminary findings suggest \"there was no kind of interference in the control systems\" to imply an attack, echoing Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro the day before.",
      "But the exact reason behind the cut is still unclear.",
      "The grid operator said on Tuesday they \"cannot draw conclusions\" until they get concrete data. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said investigators were trying to pinpoint the cause, and then would take all necessary measures \"to ensure that this does not happen again.\"",
      "Information is trickling out about what happened at the time of the cut, leading to theories about what could have caused it. Experts told the BBC it was likely caused by several failures.",
      "Here is what we know and what questions remain unanswered.",
      "Follow live: Travel chaos continues",
      "Was the power cut caused by renewable energy?",
      "S\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".",
      "Mr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.",
      "One issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.",
      "However, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.",
      "So what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.",
      "The mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50Hz in Europe and the UK.",
      "If that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.",
      "\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.",
      "If lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.",
      "But when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.",
      "Renewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.",
      "\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.",
      "Prof Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.",
      "\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.",
      "\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"",
      "Was it related to Spain's connection to France?",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.",
      "Two basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines.",
      "Spain has a high voltage line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.",
      "The Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.",
      "Was it linked to a 'rare atmospheric event'?",
      "Portugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.",
      "The message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".",
      "\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\"",
      "However, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

    "story": [
      "Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a remarkable victory in the Canadian election \u2013 and it appears to have come with a big assist from Donald Trump.",
      "The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party.",
      "Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau.",
      "The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control \u2013 with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples.",
      "This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader.",
      "He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.",

      "No one should expect those Liberals to say thank you to the American leader, however \u2013 or for Trump to soften his rhetoric, even though last month he said he preferred a Liberal prime minister. (He would go on to say that he really didn't care who won.)",
      "Instead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.",
      "The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.",
      "While Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.",
      "A Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. It would have represented what many in Trump's orbit like to believe is a global movement toward their brand of culturally conservative, anti-elite, anti-immigration, and pro-working-class politics.",
      "Although Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge.",
      "Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.",
      "Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.",
      "The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.",
      "Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test."

      "Only the Canary Islands, the Balearics and Ceuta and Melilla on the North African coast were unaffected.",
      "An increasing number of public figures are blaming a saturation of solar power and an over-reliance on renewable energy.",

      "However diversified and advanced Spain's energy mix is, the national power collapse at 12:35 on Monday required an enormous effort to get Spain back up and running.",
      "The initial focus was to get the northern and southern power generating regions working again, which grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica said was key to \"gradually re-energising the transmission grid as the generating units are connected\".",
      "The risk lay in overloading the system by turning everything on at the same time and triggering another massive outage.",
      "So everything had to be carefully phased for what experts call a \"black start\" working out as a success.",

      "Combined-cycle gas plants also played a significant part in repowering the grid, but four nuclear power reactors at Almaraz, Asc\u00f3 and and Vandell\u00f3s were automatically shut down by the outage, and three others were already offline anyway.",
      "Spain's neighbours France and Morocco also came to its aid.",

      "RTE said the Iberian network had been disconnected from 12:38 to 13:30 on Monday, when the 400kV line to Catalonia was restored. Within minutes, France had supplied 700MW and RTE said it was later able to increase that by up to 2,000 MW.",
      "Power was then eventually restored to Spain's electricity substations in the north, south and west of the peninsula.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 23:42:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Historians say there were three popes of North African descent, the last one more than 1,500 years ago.",
    "story": [
      "Now predominantly Muslim, North Africa was once a Christian heartland, producing Catholic popes who left their mark on the Church to this day.",
      "Their papacies were in the era of the Roman Empire, which stretched across modern-day Tunisia, the north-east of Algeria and the coast of western Libya.",
      "\"North Africa was the Bible Belt of ancient Christianity,\" says Prof Christopher Bellitto, a historian at Kean University in the US.",
      "Many Catholics in Africa are hoping that the papacy will return to the continent  for the first time in more than 1,500 years, as a successor to Pope Francis is chosen.",
      "Here, we look at the three previous African popes - and how they got Christians to celebrate Easter Sunday and St Valentine's Day.",
      "All three have been recognised in the Church as saints.",
      "Victor I (189-199)",
      "Thought to be of Berber origin, Pope Victor I was in charge of the Catholic Church at a time when Christians were sometimes being persecuted by Roman officials for refusing to worship Roman gods.",
      "He is perhaps best known for ensuring Christians celebrate Easter on a Sunday.",
      "In the 2nd Century, some Christian groups from the Roman province of Asia (in modern-day Turkey) celebrated Easter on the same day that Jews celebrated Passover, which could fall on different days of the week.",
      "However, Christians in the Western part of the Empire believed that Jesus was resurrected on a Sunday, so Easter should always be celebrated on that day.",
      "The debate over when the resurrection took place made it an extremely contentious issue.",
      "The \"Easter controversy\" was symbolic of larger conflicts between East and West, and whether or not Christians should follow Jewish practices.",
      "Victor I called the very first Roman Synod - a gathering of Church leaders - to resolve the impasse.",
      "He did this by threatening to excommunicate from the Church those bishops who refused to comply with his wishes.",
      "\"He was a rather forceful voice for getting everyone on literally the same page,\" Prof Bellitto told the BBC.",
      "This was an impressive feat, the historian said, because \"he was the Bishop of Rome when Christianity was illegal in the Roman empire.\"",
      "Another important part of Victor I's legacy was to introduce Latin as the common language of the Catholic Church. Previously Ancient Greek was the primary language of the Catholic Liturgy as well as official communication for the Church.",
      "Victor I himself wrote in - and spoke - Latin, which was widely spoken in North Africa.",
      "Miltiades (AD311-314)",
      "Pope Miltiades is believed to have been born in Africa.",
      "During his reign, Christianity gained increasing acceptance from successive Roman emperors, eventually becoming the Empire's official religion.",
      "Before this, the persecution of Christians had been widespread at different points in the Empire's history.",
      "However, Prof Bellitto pointed out that Miltiades was not responsible for this change, saying the Pope was the \"recipient of the Roman benevolence\" rather than being a great negotiator.",
      "Miltiades was given a palace by the Roman Emperor Constantine, becoming the first pope to have an official residence.",
      "He was also granted permission by Constantine to build the Lateran Basilica, now the oldest public church in Rome.",
      "While modern popes live and work in the Vatican, the Lateran church is sometimes referred to in Catholicism as \"the mother of all churches\".",
      "Gelasius I (AD492-496)",
      "Gelasius I is the only one of the three African popes who historians believe was not born in Africa.",
      "\"There's a reference to him being... Roman-born. So we don't know if he [ever] lived in North Africa, but it seems clear that he was of North African descent,\" Prof Bellitto explained.",
      "He was the most important of the three African church leaders, according to Prof Bellitto.",
      "Gelasius I is widely recognised as the first pope to officially be called the \"Vicar of Christ\", a term that signifies the Pope's role as Christ's representative on Earth.",
      "He also developed the Doctrine of the Two Swords, which emphasised the separate-but-equal powers of the Church and the state.",
      "Gelasius I made the critical distinction that both powers were given to the Church by God, who then delegated earthly power to the state, making the Church ultimately superior.",
      "\"Later on, in the Middle Ages, popes sometimes tried to veto the selection of an emperor or a king, because they said God gave them that power,\" said Prof Bellitto.",
      "Gelasius I is remembered, too, for his response to the Acacian Schism - a split between the Eastern and Western Christian Churches from 484 to 519.",
      "During this period, Gelasius I asserted the supremacy of Rome and the papacy over the entire Church, East and West, which experts believe went further than any of his predecessors.",
      "Gelasius is also responsible for a popular celebration which is still marked every year - establishing St Valentine's Day on 14 February in 496 to commemorate the Christian martyr St Valentine.",
      "Some accounts say Valentine was a priest who continued to perform weddings in secret when they were banned by Emperor Claudius II.",
      "Historians believe that Valentine's Day is rooted in the Roman love and fertility festival, Lupercalia, and was a move by Gelasius I to Christianise pagan traditions.",
      "What did Africa's popes look like?",
      "Prof Bellitto says there is no way of knowing with any degree of accuracy what the three popes looked like.",
      "\"We have to remember that the Roman Empire, and indeed the Middle Ages, didn't think of race as we think of it nowadays. It had nothing to do with skin colour,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"People in the Roman Empire didn't deal with race, they dealt with ethnicity.\"",
      "Prof Philomena Mwaura, an academic at Kenya's Kenyatta University, told the BBC that Roman Africa was very multicultural, with local Berber and Punic groups, freed slaves and people who had come from Rome found there.",
      "\"The North African community was quite mixed, and it was a trade route also for many people who were involved in trade in the earlier antiquity,\" she explained.",
      "Rather than identifying with specific ethnic groups, \"most people who belonged to areas within the Roman Empire regarded themselves as Roman\", Prof Mwaura added.",
      "Who will be the next Pope?How a Pope is electedWhy the conclave is so unpredictable",
      "Who will be the next Pope?",
      "How a Pope is elected",
      "Why the conclave is so unpredictable",
      "Why hasn't there been an African pope since?",
      "None of of the 217 popes since Gelasius I are believed to have come from Africa.",
      "\"The church in North Africa was weakened by very many forces, including the fall of the Roman Empire and also the incursion of Muslims [into North Africa] in the 7th Century,\" Prof Mwaura said.",
      "However, some experts argue that the prevalence of Islam in North Africa does not explain the absence of a pope from the entire continent over more than 1,500 years.",
      "Prof Bellitto said the process of electing a new pontiff became an \"Italian monopoly\" for many years.",
      "However, he said there was a strong chance of a pope from Asia or Africa in the near future because Catholics in the southern hemisphere outnumber those in the north.",
      "In fact, Catholicism is expanding more rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa today than anywhere else.",
      "The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023. This accounts for 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "Three Africans are in the race to succeed Pope Francis - the Democratic Republic of Congo's Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, Ghana's Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson and Guinea's Robert Sarah.",
      "But Prof Mwaura argued that \"although Christianity is very strong in Africa, the power of the Church is still in the north, where the resources have been\".",
      "\"Maybe, as it continues to be very strong within the continent and supporting itself, then a time will come when there could be an African pope,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Shin Bet head Ronen Bar accused each other of lies or inaccuracies in sworn depositions.",
    "story": [
      "The head of Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency has resigned.",
      "Ronen Bar made the announcement that he would leave his position on 15 June at a memorial event for Shin Bet members who have died in service.",
      "It came after he had been engaged in a fierce trading of recriminations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who dismissed him last month. A challenge to the Supreme Court by the attorney general and the opposition had put the move on hold.",
      "Ronen Bar said he had chosen to announce his resignation on an evening that, in his words, symbolised \"remembrance, heroism and sacrifice\".",
      "He said every public servant who failed to stop the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the Gaza war, needed to bow their heads \"humbly before those who were killed, or wounded, or taken hostage, and act accordingly\".",
      "On Sunday, Netanyahu presented an affidavit to the Supreme Court in which he accused Bar of being a liar.",
      "In his own affidavit, the Shin Bet chief had accused the prime minister of demanding excessive personal loyalty and ordering his agency to spy on anti-government protesters.",
      "The confrontation has further exposed the deepening rifts in Israeli politics and society between the right-wing and hardliners supporting Netanyahu and the more liberal elements in the country, who took to the streets to protest against the government's moves to curb the powers of the judiciary for many months before the 7 October attacks.",
      "It centres on Netanyahu's insistence that he fired the Shin Bet head for professional failures.",
      "Bar countered by saying that his dismissal was motivated by political and personal considerations.",
      "In his affidavit last week, the spy chief said that it was \"clear\" that if there were to be a constitutional crisis, Netanyahu would expect him to obey the prime minister and not the courts.",
      "He also said Netanyahu had put pressure on him to use the Shin Bet to spy on Israelis leading or providing financial support to anti-government protests.",
      "Many in Israel reacted with alarm, saying it was evidence of what appeared to be an unprecedented effort to overstep the powers of the domestic intelligence agency.",
      "In his affidavit, which functioned as a form of rebuttal, Netanyahu excoriated the Shin Bet head.",
      "\"The accusation according to which I allegedly demanded action against innocent civilians, or against a non-violent and legitimate protest during the protests of 2023, is an absolute lie,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu also trained his sights on the security failures in the lead-up to and during the 7 October attacks, saying that Bar bore \"massive and direct responsibility\" for them and had \"failed in his role as chief of Shin Bet and lost the confidence of the entire Israeli government as far as his ability to continue to manage the organisation\".",
      "Bar immediately responded in kind in a statement, saying Netanyahu's affidavit was \"full of inaccuracies, biased quotes and half-truths aimed at taking things out of context and changing reality\".",
      "The Supreme Court was facing a quandary over who to believe - which Bar's resignation may have to some extent pre-empted.",
      "However, Bar made clear on Monday that he would play a part, if necessary, in any future proceedings.",
      "\"The court hearing is not about my personal affairs, but about the independence of the next heads of the Shin Bet, and of course I am ready to appear for any procedure that the court may require in this regard in the future,\" he said.",
      "The issues which have been exposed in the fierce recriminations between the two men have once again focused attention on the increasing bitterness between opposed sections of Israeli society.",
      "These have been further exacerbated by the ever-growing fault line between those who support Netanyahu and his hard-line government in wanting to continue the war in Gaza to eliminate Hamas at all costs, and those who believe the fate of the living Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas must be put first, even if it means ending the war.",

      "Mostly in relation to Russia's president.",
      "Short ceasefires are becoming quite the Kremlin thing.",
      "First, Vladimir Putin declared a 30-hour cessation of hostilities over Easter, portraying it as a \"humanitarian\" gesture.",
      "Now the Kremlin leader has announced a three-day unilateral truce for early May. It will run from 8 May to 10 May to coincide with events marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two.",
      "In a statement, the Kremlin said that for 72 hours all military actions would cease. It cited \"humanitarian\" considerations (again) and made it clear Moscow expected Ukraine to follow suit.",
      "In response to the proposal, Ukraine questioned why Russia could not commit to a ceasefire immediately and called for one to be implemented for at least 30 days.",
      "\"If Russia truly wants peace, it must cease fire immediately,\" Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said, adding: \"Why wait until May 8th?\"",
      "So, from the Russian president who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, is this a sincere effort to end the fighting?",
      "Or simply a public relations exercise by the Kremlin to impress Donald Trump?",
      "Kremlin critics will suspect PR.",
      "During the extremely brief so-called Easter ceasefire, Ukraine had accused Russian troops of violating it repeatedly.",
      "Moscow had used its announcement of a 30-hour pause in the fighting to send a signal to the White House: that in this war Russia is the peacemaker and Kyiv the aggressor. It accused Ukraine of ignoring what Moscow presented as an olive branch and of prolonging the war.",

      "\"It makes me think,\" he added, \"that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!\"",

      "Another attempt to signal to Washington that the Kremlin has only the best of intentions? That Russia is really the good guy in all of this?",
      "If so, it doesn't appear to have worked. Not immediately. The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted Moscow's offer of a temporary ceasefire, but said: \"The president [Donald Trump] has made it clear he wants to see a permanent ceasefire first to stop the killing, stop the bloodshed.",
      "\"He is increasingly frustrated with leaders of both countries,\" Leavitt said.",
      "It's an indication that the US president may be losing patience now with the Kremlin, despite having directed most of his public criticism in recent months towards President Zelensky.",

      "\"Kids came out with Bluetooth speakers and their water. It was a carnival.\"",
      "Protests earlier in the week had already led lawmakers to axe tax increases on bread, cooking oil, mobile money and motor vehicles, as well as an eco levy that would have raised the cost of goods like nappies and sanitary towels.",
      "But other measures to raise the $2.7bn (\u00a32bn) the government said it needed to cut its reliance on external borrowing, such as higher import taxes and another on specialised hospitals, remained.",
      "\"For the first time it was the Kenyan people - the working class and the middle class and the lower class - against the ruling class,\" says Mwangi.",
      "The protesters had one target - parliament, where the final vote was taking place.",
      "By 09:30 local time, the last of the MPs filed into the lower house.",
      "Outside, thousands pushed towards Parliament Road from the east, north and west of the city.",
      "\"For me, it was just a normal day,\" says 26-year-old student journalist Ademba Allans.",

      "\"The numbers start getting bigger and people actually start getting arrested,\" says Allans. \"The police are everywhere. They're trying to push people back. People are even climbing on top of those water cannons.\"",

      "\"This is when everybody is saying: 'Whatever happens, we are going to enter the parliament and show the MPs that we believe in what we're fighting for,'\" says Allans.",
      "At 14:20, protesters finally broke through the police blockade and reached the road running alongside parliament.",
      "An abandoned police truck stationed outside the gates was set on fire. Fences were torn down and protesters set foot on parliamentary grounds. The incursion was short-lived. Parliamentary security forces quickly cleared them out.",
      "At the same time, police officers went back up Parliament Road in force to drive the protesters back.",
      "While this was happening, journalists were filming, producing minute-by-minute footage from many angles.",

      "In the video of the officer shouting, \"uaa!\", the shooter's back was to the camera. But the BBC compared his body armour, riot shield and headgear with that of every police officer at the scene.",
      "In his case, he had an upturned neck guard. We matched his distinctive uniform to an officer in a video recorded seconds later. There, he made sure to hide his face before firing into the crowd. We do not know his name.",
      "Even after the fatal shots, the plain-clothes officer could still be heard urging his colleagues forward to \"kill\". He was not so cautious about concealing his identity: his name is John Kaboi.",

      "The destruction was severe but, after five minutes, footage showed them leaving the same way they had come in.",
      "At 15:04, shots rang out again and protesters tumbled across the flattened fence. As the smoke cleared, camera footage showed three bodies lying on the ground. Two were wounded - one raised his hand but could not get up.",
      "The third, 27-year-old finance student Eric Shieni, was dead - shot in the head from behind as he was leaving the grounds. The BBC again found, as in the cases of Chege and Mutisya, that he had been unarmed.",
      "BBC Africa Eye analysed more than 150 images taken during the minutes before and after Shieni was shot. We are able to identify the soldier who fired at the back of his head from 25m (82ft) away - again, we do not know his name.",
      "\"The video is very clear,\" says Faith Odhiambo, president of the Law Society of Kenya.",
      "\"The aim was to kill those protesters. They could have had him arrested. But the fact that you shoot his head - it was clearly an intention to kill.",

    "summary": "The impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.",
    "story": [
      "During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House.",
      "But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed.",
      "In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors.",
      "In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life.",
      "To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms.",
      "But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process.",
      "Here are six turning points from the first 100 days.",
      "A social media post sets off a constitutional firestorm",
      "For once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry.",
      "Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X.",
      "In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy.",
      "Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution.",
      "Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders.",
      "But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts.",
      "The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies.",
      "This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.",
      "The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.",
      "Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court.",
      "A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote.",
      "Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply.",
      "It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith.",
      "While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.",
      "Brandishing a chainsaw, dressed in black",
      "Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd.",
      "The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.",
      "Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.",
      "\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"",
      "It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.",
      "Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash.",
      "Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public.",
      "Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events.",
      "Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly.",
      "Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending.",
      "If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.",
      "'I had to think fast as billions was lost before my eyes'",
      "When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast.",
      "\"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says.",
      "McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\".",
      "He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.",
      "\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\"",
      "He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.",
      "The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.",
      "The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory.",
      "His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans.",
      "But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent.",
      "The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession.",
      "While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field.",
      "\"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"",
      "Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.",
      "Spotted in a photo - 'My son, shackled in prison'",
      "\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world.",
      "She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows.",
      "At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter.",
      "When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent.",
      "A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge.",
      "Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years.",
      "A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz.",
      "Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas.",
      "Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted.",
      "While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches.",
      "They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.",
      "A clash with academic, media and corporate worlds",
      "On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on.",
      "In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants.",
      "It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations.",
      "The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address.",
      "But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024.",
      "The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.",
      "Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department.",
      "A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds.",
      "Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives.",
      "Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments.",
      "A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (\u00a311m) to Trump's presidential foundation.",
      "CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted.",
      "Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.",
      "A retreat on race and identity",
      "The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River.",
      "Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack.",
      "A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence.",
      "It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.",
      "Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",
      "His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes.",
      "First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups.",
      "Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers.",
      "But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America.",
      "While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows.",
      "Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\".",
      "Donald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president.",
      "His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire.",
      "In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president.",
      "And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question.",
      "Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump's agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed.",
      "And in next year's mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority.",
      "Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump's efforts.",
      "The first 100 days of Trump's second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.",

    "summary": "Suspects who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in October 2016 stand trial in Paris.",
    "story": [
      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

      "But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process.",
      "Here are six turning points from the first 100 days.",
      "A social media post sets off a constitutional firestorm",
      "For once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry.",
      "Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X.",
      "In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy.",
      "Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution.",
      "Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders.",
      "But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts.",
      "The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies.",
      "This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.",
      "The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.",
      "Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court.",
      "A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote.",
      "Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply.",
      "It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith.",
      "While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.",
      "Brandishing a chainsaw, dressed in black",
      "Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd.",
      "The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.",
      "Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.",
      "\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"",
      "It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.",
      "Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash.",
      "Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public.",
      "Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events.",
      "Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly.",
      "Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending.",
      "If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.",
      "'I had to think fast as billions was lost before my eyes'",
      "When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast.",
      "\"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says.",
      "McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\".",
      "He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.",
      "\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\"",
      "He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.",
      "The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.",
      "The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory.",
      "His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans.",
      "But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent.",
      "The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession.",
      "While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field.",
      "\"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"",
      "Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.",
      "Spotted in a photo - 'My son, shackled in prison'",
      "\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world.",
      "She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows.",
      "At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter.",
      "When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent.",
      "A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge.",
      "Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years.",
      "A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz.",
      "Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas.",
      "Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted.",
      "While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches.",
      "They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.",
      "A clash with academic, media and corporate worlds",
      "On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on.",
      "In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants.",
      "It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations.",
      "The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address.",
      "But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024.",
      "The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.",
      "Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department.",
      "A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds.",
      "Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives.",
      "Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments.",
      "A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (\u00a311m) to Trump's presidential foundation.",
      "CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted.",
      "Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.",
      "A retreat on race and identity",
      "The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River.",
      "Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack.",
      "A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence.",
      "It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.",
      "Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",
      "His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes.",
      "First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups.",
      "Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers.",
      "But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America.",
      "While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows.",
      "Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\".",
      "Donald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president.",
      "His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire.",
      "In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president.",
      "And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question.",
      "Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump's agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed.",
      "And in next year's mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority.",
      "Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump's efforts.",
      "The first 100 days of Trump's second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.",

      "She recalled knocking on doors earlier this month as she campaigned for her candidate in -24C (-11F) temperatures.",
      "She said it's rare in northern communities for people to knock before entering someone's home. Instead, the tight-knit culture permits visitors to simply \"walk in and say hello\" - almost unthinkable in other parts of the country.",

      "In Nunavut, one of Canada's three northern territories, the majority-Inuit population speak Inuktitut.",
      "Ms Kettler said one of the biggest expenses was translating campaign signs and hiring an interpreter for Kabloona, the candidate.",
      "Election issues for northerners too are unique.",
      "\"The national campaign is really focused on Arctic security and sovereignty, whereas our campaign here is focused on food security and people being able to survive,\" Ms Kettler said.",
      "Food can be prohibitively expensive and there are infrastructure challenges to accessing clean water for a number of Indigenous and northern communities.",
      "She was boiling water to drink while campaigning in Arviat, she said, and described being unable to rely on calling voters as she canvasses because a phone plan is the first thing they sacrifice to afford food.",

      "Mr Nguyen also spoke about security considerations.",
      "Once polls close, the ballots are counted at the polling station and then stored safely either with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), or a local hamlet - a small community that provides municipal services to its residents.",

      "Home to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.",
      "For Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.",
      "Running the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.",
      "Burnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.",
      "Streaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.",
      "A once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.",
      "As a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.",
      "Health has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.",
      "But experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.",
      "Australians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.",
      "The cracks in a 'national treasure'",
      "Healthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.",
      "Seeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.",
      "Though she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.",
      "\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"",
      "When Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".",
      "Health funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.",
      "Patients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.",
      "Medicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.",
      "Fast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.",
      "There is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.",
      "But the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.",
      "That is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.",
      "According to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.",
      "But experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees.",
      "Brisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them.",
      "\"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester\u2026 [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\"",

      "This year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics \u2013 only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one.",
      "The results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\"",
      "And that's just primary care.",
      "Public specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed \u2013 with wait times often far beyond safe levels \u2013 that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work.",
      "There are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief.",
      "Priced out of care",
      "The BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment.",

      "\"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says.",
      "All of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust.",
      "Every single one of those issues is more acute in the regions.",
      "Streaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all.",
      "It's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice.",
      "\"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community.",
      "\"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\"",
      "She came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps.",
      "It's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment.",
      "\"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice.",
      "When the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.",
      "It means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.",
      "Who should foot the bill?",
      "\"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.",
      "Like many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.",
      "There's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.",
      "Many doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.",
      "Health economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.",
      "The taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.",
      "\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"",
      "The original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.",
      "She says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need.",
      "Both the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.",
      "\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.",
      "On the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.",
      "\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.",
      "His government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.",
      "But the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill.",
      "Proposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.",
      "One Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.",
      "Labor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".",
      "But many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference.",
      "There's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.",
      "Experts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.",
      "That is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.",
      "And the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost.",
      "\"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says.",
      "In Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late. Things are already dangerous here.",
      "\"Maybe that's the cynic in me,\" she says, shaking her head.",

      "Democrats have struggled to land a unified message in President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, with fractures both in Congress and among supporters. What comes next for a party in a difficult spot?",
      "The rural, agricultural town of Bakersfield, California, is an odd stop for a pair of East Coast progressive politicians.",
      "After all, Trump won the surrounding county by 20 points, and the dusty fields and endless orchards feel a world away from the party's power centres in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.",
      "Yet Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders packed a local auditorium during a recent stop on their Fighting Oligarchy tour. The rally felt like a 1960s-style sit-in with attendees singing along to a gentle rendition of Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land. They launched rowdy boos and jeers every time Sanders inveighed against Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "The visit also felt like an answered prayer for local Democrats and left-leaning Independents who oppose Trump and his policies, while directing much of their fury at their own party, which they feel has failed to mount an effective opposition.",
      "The Democratic party \"should be doing more to try to protect everybody,\" said Karla Alcantar, 26, who attended the rally. \"I feel like some of them have just folded over completely, and there are some that are trying to do the work of all.\"",
      "\"I definitely feel like they should be doing way more,\" she said.",
      "Democrats at a crossroads",
      "It is not a great time to be a Democratic politician in the United States. The party is out of power. Elected officials cannot agree on a course of action to counter Trump's agenda. No clear leader has emerged to unify the unwieldy coalition. Various ideological and generational factions are warring against each other and nobody seems to be winning.",
      "\"I understand that they don't have the power to, like, change like things drastically, but they do have the power to slow down like things even a little bit,\" said rally attendee Juan Dominguez, 26. \"It honestly feels like I'm not seeing any of that.\"",
      "The anger extends beyond the rally-goers.",
      "Fifty-two percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said their party's leadership is moving in the wrong direction, according to a CNN/SSRS poll conducted in mid-March, as opposed to 48% who said it is moving in the right direction.",
      "That same survey suggested a desire for strong opposition: 57% wanted Democrats in Congress to try and stop the Republican party's agenda. It's a complete reversal of a poll in 2017, the year after Trump first won the presidency, that suggested 74% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted leaders to work with Republicans following a divisive election.",
      "\"What they're pressing for is not just Democratic leaders to lash out because that's going to make their followers feel good,\" said former Pennsylvania congressman Conor Lamb, who held a town hall-style event in Pittsburgh last week.",
      "Though Lamb said he is not currently running for office, he felt a hunger within the Democratic base.",
      "\"I think they feel like the survival of the system we have all counted on is itself on the line, and they want us to act with that level of urgency,\" Lamb told the BBC. \"I think it's important for us not to forget just to be advocates for things that are specific and concrete, and really affecting people.\"",
      "Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's tour is just one attempt to solve that. It stops in conservative-dominated areas and remains laser-focused on the economy, citing cost of living grievances that propelled Trump to a second term, while framing him and his billionaire supporters like Musk as the culprits.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez put the argument simply: \"Oligarchy or democracy?\"",
      "But the Fighting Oligarchy tour is only one theory about how the Democratic Party should evolve.",
      "\"It is completely normal when a party loses, especially the presidency, for there to be this period of soul searching and asking, 'What's next?'\" said Professor Christian Grose, a political scientist at the University of Southern California.",
      "Some Democrats accused their party of falling out of step with more conservative Americans on subjects like transgender rights, or failing to accommodate diverse viewpoints within the party's ideological spectrum. Without widening their potential base, these Democrats argue, they stand little chance of regaining power.",
      "One such gambit by California Governor Gavin Newsom involves moving the party's branding more to the center. Though Newsom has long brushed off White House ambitions, he is among a new generation of Democrats who could vie for the presidency in 2028.",
      "The governor, known nationwide as a liberal defender of abortion and LGBTQ rights, recently launched a podcast to host conversations with politicos who disagree with him.",
      "Newsom's decision to interview right-wing strategist Steve Bannon infuriated many Democrats.",
      "\"I think it's important to have difficult conversations or even have a civil conversation that may be difficult for people to listen to, because everyone is out there trying to tear each other down,\" Newsom said at a recent press conference.",
      "New guard or old guard?",
      "While such debates over whether to moderate or play to the base feature in every party's soul-searching, this year does have a new twist, Mr Grose noted.",
      "\"Some of the questions for the Democrats' strategy is the age question - is it time for a new generation? That is a little unique,\" he said.",
      "David Hogg, 25, a gun safety organiser and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, is currently locked in a heated public debate with a party elder statesmen, strategist James Carville.",

    "story": [
      "A young female South African doctor has sparked a nationwide conversation about a form of domestic abuse often shrouded in silence - financial abuse.",
      "In a series of viral videos Dr Celiwe Ndaba opened up about how she said she had been financially exploited by her husband, how it had spiralled and led to their separation.",
      "Often sitting in her car on her way to work, the mother of three vlogged over two weeks about how despite her successful career she had become trapped in a toxic marriage for years, feeling manipulated to fund her husband's lifestyle - in particular his desire to drive a Mercedes Benz.",
      "Taking out loans for him to buy such vehicles was the \"worst decision\" of her life, putting the family under huge financial pressure, said Dr Ndaba - who since sharing her story has reverted to using her maiden name and the number of her followers has ballooned.",
      "Despite pleas for her husband to downgrade, she said he refused - accusing her of wanting to \"turn him into a laughing stock by making him drive a small car\".",
      "The medic said she was speaking out as she wanted to issue a warning to others - that it was not only \"uneducated\" and \"less fortunate\" women who find themselves in abusive relationships.",
      "Her estranged husband, Temitope Dada, has not responded to a BBC request for comment.",
      "In the wake of the social media storm, he set up a TikTok account, where in one of his first videos he acknowledged: \"You may know me as\u2026 'Mr Benz or nothing.'\"",
      "The few posts he has made are accompanied by hashtags such as #divorcetrauma - saying the accusations are lies.",
      "Nonetheless, the comments section on Dr Ndaba's TikTok and other social media platforms have transformed into support groups, filled with female breadwinners sharing eerily similar stories.",
      "\"You are brave to speak out so publicly\u2026 I have been suffering in silence,\" one person commented.",
      "Bertus Preller, a lawyer based in Cape Town, believes this is because although South African women are becoming doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs, getting well-paid jobs does not necessarily free them from the clutches of the patriarchy.",
      "Women's financial independence clashes with \"cultural norms that prioritise male authority\", he says.",
      "If anything, their success appears to make them targets.",
      "Financial abuse occurs when one partner dominates or exploits the other's financial resources, the lawyer explains.",
      "\"It is a subtle yet potent tactic of domestic violence, aimed at keeping the victim under control,\" he says.",
      "In South Africa, this is legally classified as economic abuse under the Domestic Violence Act.",
      "Mr Preller says things like \"unjustly withholding money for essentials or interfering with shared assets,\" are covered by the act.",
      "A university lecturer, who requested anonymity, told the BBC how her husband had lied about his qualifications and eventually left her in financial ruin.",
      "It started with her car that he mostly drove but never refuelled. Then loans she took out for his multiple failed business ventures. Finally, there came an eviction notice as she said he had stopped contributing towards rent, leaving her to shoulder all the expenses for their family, which included three children.",
      "Despite this, they stayed together for close to a decade - even though he was also physically abusive.",
      "\"He's very smart... I was in love with his smartness, his big dreams. But he couldn't follow them up with actions. His pride was his downfall,\" she said.",
      "Even when he managed to get some money, he still did not contribute.",
      "\"He started withholding whatever money he had for himself. He'd go out drinking with his friends, come back - the salary is gone,\" she said.",
      "Legal financial expert Somila Gogoba says that beyond the control of money, financial abuse often has deep psychological roots.",
      "\"For the abuser, this behaviour may stem from feelings of inadequacy, fear of abandonment, or the need for dominance,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"For the victim, the psychological impact includes feelings of worthlessness, fear, and dependence, which can be paralysing.\"",
      "Research from the University of South Africa suggests these are not isolated cases \u2013 and that women who out-earn their partners face significantly higher risks of intimate partner violence.",
      "Out of their in-depth study of 10 women who were the primary breadwinners of their families, only two were married.",
      "\"For eight of the participants, their choice of being single resulted from their experiences of physical, emotional and sexual violence\u2026 All the women said they believed that their role as female breadwinners was viewed as threatening to the traditional male role of a provider,\" said researcher Bianca Parry.",
      "Ms Gogoba says female breadwinners are less valued than their male counterparts, despite their economic contributions: \"This cultural backdrop can encourage some partners to feel entitled to control the finances, even when they do not contribute equally.",
      "\"This control is not just about money - it is also about power and maintaining a grip on the relationship dynamics.\"",
      "Nombulelo Shange, sociologist lecturer at the University of the Free State, says it is part of a growing pattern in South Africa of middle-class women being financially exploited.",
      "\"Black women face a double patriarchy: Western expectations at work, traditional expectations at home. When these collide, harmful ideologies escalate,\" she told the BBC.",
      "She explained that balancing the pressures of being a successful woman, but playing the role of \"the caregiver, the mother, the good wife, the good neighbour and community member who goes to church every Sunday\", was difficult as women were always taught to tiptoe around men's egos.",
      "Since Dr Ndaba's revelations, women on social media have shared stories of giving their male partners their debit or credit cards when they go out to eat so it appears as though he is paying for the meal.",
      "For Dr Shange this shows how the burden of a happy home is often placed on the woman's shoulders.",
      "\"You think: 'If I just get them a car, they'll be happy.' Love makes you blind. When your person struggles, you struggle too - you want to fix it,\" she said.",
      "By the time the university lecturer divorced her husband, she was left with debts of 140,000 rand ($7,500; \u00a35,600) - all racked up in her name.",
      "\"Before, I could plan things like holidays. Now they are a luxury,\" she said.",
      "Dr Ndaba has been at pains to tell her followers, as she did on one vlog: \"Finance is an important aspect of people's marriages.\"",
      "The lecturer could not agree more, urging young women to take their time when getting to know their partners and have open, honest conversations.",
      "\"Talk about the finances, talk about your background, talk about emotions and character.\"",
      "Ms Gogoba urged more people to protect themselves from their partner, telling them to keep a separate bank account, keep their pins secure and monitor their credit cards.",
      "They all agreed that women should understand that love should not come with an unsustainable price tag.",

      "On a typical day, groups of school children would stare in awe at this reminder of their nation's imposing past, tourists would file through one of Khartoum's must-sees, and on occasion concerts were held in the grounds.",
      "But that was before war broke out two years ago.",
      "As the Sudanese military reasserts its control over the capital, having finally chased out its rival the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the full scale of the destruction of two years of war is becoming clear.",
      "Government ministries, banks and office blocks stand blackened and burned, while the museum \u2013 a symbol of the nation's proud history and culture \u2013 has been particularly hard hit.",
      "Senior officials say tens of thousands of artefacts were either destroyed or shipped off to be sold during the time the RSF was in control of central Khartoum, where the museum is situated.",
      "\"They destroyed our identity, and our history,\" Ikhlas Abdel Latif Ahmed, director of museums at Sudan's National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums, told the BBC's Newsday programme.",
      "Before the conflict, the National Museum was a gem.",
      "Located at the very heart of Sudan \u2013 close to the Presidential Palace, and the confluence of the Blue Nile and White Nile rivers \u2013 it told a story of the succession of great civilisations that inhabited this area over time.",

      "\"The building was very unique and very beautiful,\" Ms Ahmed said.",
      "\"The militia [the description Sudanese officials give to the RSF] took so many of the unique and beautiful collections, and destroyed and damaged the rest.\"",
      "Looting has been reported at other Sudanese museums and ancient sites. Last September the UN's world heritage organisation, Unesco, warned of a \"threat to culture\" and urged art dealers not to import or export artefacts smuggled out of Sudan.",
      "Before the war, the National Museum was undergoing rehabilitation, and so many of its treasures were boxed up.",
      "That may have made it easier for the collections to be removed.",
      "Sudanese officials say precious artefacts from the National Museum were taken away to be sold.",
      "They strongly suspect RSF fighters took some of the valuables to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They produced no evidence. However the UN panel of experts on Sudan has reported that the RSF has been exporting significant quantities of gold to the UAE, since even before the war.",
      "The UAE has also been widely accused of funding the RSF, although both parties have always denied these accusations.",
      "\"We had a strong room for the gold collection, they managed to open it and took all the gold,\" Ms Ahmed said.",
      "\"Maybe they kept it for themselves, or maybe they traded it in the market.\"",
      "So the whereabouts of pieces like a gold collar from the pyramid of King Talakhamani at Nuri, which dates to the 5th Century BC, are unknown.",
      "Asked about the value of what was taken, Ms Ahmed replied simply: \"There is no value for the museum artefacts, it's more expensive than you could imagine.\"",
      "The de facto government of Sudan says it will contact Interpol and Unesco to attempt to recover artefacts looted from the National Museum and elsewhere.",
      "However recovering the artefacts seems a difficult and perhaps even dangerous task, with little immediate prospect of success.",
      "The government, and other Sudanese observers, say the RSF's attacks against museums, universities and buildings like the National Records Office are a conscious attempt to destroy the Sudanese state - but, again, the RSF denies this.",
      "Amgad Farid, who runs the Fikra for Studies and Development think-tank, is particularly critical of the looting.",
      "\"The RSF's actions transcend mere criminality,\" he wrote in a piece shared by his organisation.",
      "\"They constitute a deliberate and malicious assault on Sudan's historical identity, targeting the invaluable heritage of Nubian, Coptic, and Islamic civilisations spanning over 7,000 years, constituting a cornerstone of African and global history, enshrined within these museums.",
      "\"This is not an incidental loss amid conflict - it is a calculated endeavour to erase Sudan's legacy, to sever its people from their past, and to plunder millennia of human history for profit.\"",
      "The story of the National Museum \u2013 taken over by armed men, its gold and valuables looted and stolen \u2013 mirrors the individual stories of so many Sudanese in this conflict: they have been forced to flee, their houses occupied, their gold stolen.",
      "According to the UN, nearly 13 million people have been forced from their homes since the fighting began in 2023, while an estimated 150,000 people have been killed.",
      "\"The war is against the people of Sudan,\" Ms Ahmed says, bemoaning the war's human cost, as well as the unimaginable loss of centuries of heritage.",

      "Mr Modry, a retired heart surgeon, is a co-leader of the Alberta Prosperity Project, a grassroots organisation pushing for an independence referendum.",
      "The possibility of a split has long been a talking point in this conservative-leaning province. But two factors have given it new momentum: Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state, and the subsequent boost that has given the Liberal Party in the polls ahead of Monday's federal election.",
      "Mr Modry told the BBC the separatist movement has grown in recent months - driven in part, he believes, by the president's rhetoric.",
      "\"We're not interested in that\", he said. \"We're interested in Alberta sovereignty.\"",
      "Jeffrey Rath, however - a lawyer and rancher from Calgary who is another of the project's co-founders - was not as dismissive of Trump's 51st state suggestion. Although he agrees independence is the priority, he could see a future where Alberta joined with the US.",

      "This sense of \"western alienation\", a term used to describe the feeling that the region is often overlooked by politicians in Canada's capital, is nothing new. For decades, many in the oil and gas-rich prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan have bemoaned how they are underrepresented, despite the region's economic significance for the country as a whole.",
      "That resentment grew under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, which brought in environmental policies some Albertans view as a direct attack on the region's economic growth.",
      "National polls suggest the Liberals, now under the leadership of Mark Carney, could be headed for their fourth consecutive win come election day on Monday. That it could come in part because of a surge of support in Ontario and Quebec - the eastern provinces where so much of the population is concentrated - only adds to the regional divide.",
      "Judy Schneider, whose husband works in the oil industry in Calgary, told the BBC she would vote \"yes\" in an independence referendum.",
      "She said she didn't see Carney, who spent much of the last decade away from Canada but was raised in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, as a westerner.",
      "\"He can come and say 'I'm from Alberta,' but is he?\" Ms Schneider said.",
      "An independent Alberta remains an unlikely prospect - a recent Angus Reid poll suggested that only one in four Albertans would vote to leave Canada if a referendum were held now. A majority of Canadians, however, feel the issue should be taken seriously, a separate Nanos poll indicated.",
      "Political analysts say the divide will pose a challenge to the country's next prime minister, especially if Carney wins. And even a victory for Calgary-born Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre would \"not solve the imbalance that presently exists between the East and the West,\" Mr Modry, the activist, said.",
      "That wider sentiment has pushed Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who leads the United Conservative Party, to strike her own path in trade talks with the US, while other provincial leaders and the federal government have co-ordinated their efforts closely. She even visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.",
      "In Canada, Smith has publicly warned of a \"national unity crisis\" if Alberta's demands - which centre around repealing Trudeau-era environmental laws to accelerate oil and gas production - are not met by the new prime minister within six months of the election.",

    "story": [
      "A trial over the 2016 heist in which armed robbers tied up reality star Kim Kardashian in her bedroom and stole millions of dollars' worth of jewelry has begun in Paris.",
      "Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 are on trial on charges of robbery and kidnapping of the media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016. Two of them acknowledged their participation and the others denied it.",
      "Kardashian was in France for Fashion Week when men dressed as police officers allegedly tied her up with zip ties and duct tape, held her at gunpoint and stole $10 million worth of jewelry, including a $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian described being terrified, thinking she was going to be raped and killed when the criminals broke into her bedroom and pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun like clear as day,\" she said on her show, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\" \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "Her lawyers said she will testify in person at the trial, with a provisional schedule showing that is expected to happen on May 13. The trial is scheduled to run through May 23.",
      "\"Ms. Kardashian is reserving her testimony for the court and jury and does not wish to elaborate further at this time,\" they said. \"She has great respect and admiration for the French justice system and has been treated with great respect by the French authorities. She wishes the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion, in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",
      "Twelve people were originally expected in the defendants' box. One of them died and another is seriously ill and can't be tried. According to the investigation, five of the 10 defendants were present at the scene of the robbery.",
      "The \"Granddad Robbers\"",
      "The French press has dubbed them The Granddad Robbers because the main defendants are older \u2014 most in their 60s and 70s \u2014 and have been bank robbers with long criminal records.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery.",
      "Aomar Ait Khedache, now aged 69, was allegedly the mastermind behind the heist.",
      "Known as \"Old Omar\", he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "When the robbers arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where the celebrity was staying during Paris Fashion Week, they allegedly demanded the guard, at gunpoint, direct them to \"the rapper's wife\" \u2013 a reference to her then-husband, West.",
      "\"Old Omar\" reportedly wrote to Kardashian in 2017, when he was in custody, to say sorry. Her lawyers said he wrote to apologize after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "He left the hotel on a bicycle, as did two others, then met his son, who was waiting for him in a parked car at a nearby train station.",
      "The other man \u2014 77-year-old Yunice Abbas \u2014 has publicly admitted to being a lookout during the robbery.",
      "He said he was unarmed and did not personally threaten Kardashian, but admitted he shared responsibility for the crime.",
      "In 2021, he co-authored a French-language book titled \"I Sequestered Kim Kardashian.\"",
      "Abbas told reporters that he will apologize during the trial and will give details of his role in the heist but won't denounce anyone else.",
      "The other defendants are suspected of providing information about Kardashian's presence in the apartment. Others are accused of playing a role in the resale of the jewelry in Antwerp, Belgium.",
      "The gangsters stole many pieces of jewelry. Only one piece of jewelry \u2014 a diamond cross on platinum that was lost during the suspects' escape \u2014 has been recovered.",
      "Celebrity status could distract from trial",
      "As the trial opened Monday, lawyers for the accused told reporters outside the court that they were concerned that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "\"It's a simple case with people who will accept responsibility, who regret what they've done,\" said Frank Berton, lawyer for Khedache.",
      "Another of his lawyers, Chloe Arnoux, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",
      "The lawyer for night watchman Abderrahmane Ouatiki told journalists on his way into court that he was tired of suggestions that the robbers who allegedly forced his client at gunpoint to direct them to Kardashian's suite were \"kind old men.\"",

    "summary": "The singer-songwriter - subject of the new Broadway musical \"Just in Time\" - was renowned for such pop hits as \"Splish Splash,\" \"Mack the Knife,\" and \"Dream Lover.\" But his life was unsettled when he learned, at age 32, the startling truth about the identity of his mother.",
    "story": [
      "Bobby Darin was a major pop star \u2026 a singer, dancer, musician, and an Oscar nominee. He was the entertainer who did it all, except Broadway. Until now!",
      "Tony Award-winner Jonathan Groff (\"Merrily We Roll Along\") plays the icon of the late 1950s and '60s in the musical \"Just in Time.\" \"He was at the height of his powers, when he was on the floor of a nightclub with the audience in the palm of his hand,\" said Groff.",
      "For Darin, a live audience was oxygen. So, too, for Groff: \"You can feel this vibration between performer and audience member. [It's], to me, the most essential thing to ignite in the telling of his story.\"",
      "It's taken seven years and a whole lot of sweat to bring the show to Broadway. The casting of Groff \u2013 beloved for his roles on stage, and as Kristoff in the \"Frozen\" movies \u2013 might not seem obvious. Groff grew up on a horse farm in Pennsylvania Mennonite country; Darin was a scrappy Italian kid from the Bronx.",
      "I asked Groff to whom he liked listening when he was growing up. \"I am in fourth or fifth grade, on the computer or Nintendo in the basement, blasting Ethel Merman, 'Annie Get Your Gun,'\" he laughed.",
      "\"So, this is the 1990s, probably? And you're playing something from the 1940s?\"",
      "\"Exactly!\"",
      "Likewise, Bobby Darin was an old soul, says his son, Dodd Darin. \"He admired, he loved, he respected the old timers. He loved that era of show business. That's what he related to.\"",
      "That may have had something to do with the woman who raised him: \"Polly, his mother, was an old vaudevillian,\" said Dodd. \"And she nurtured him and said, 'You can't play stickball in the street. And you can't roughhouse with kids' ('cause he was frail and sickly). 'But you can learn to sing. You can learn to dance. You can learn to play piano.' And it opened a whole world.\"",
      "\"Frail and sickly\" was no exaggeration. Born Walden Robert Cassotto, Darin suffered several bouts of rheumatic fever as a child, permanently damaging his heart. When he was a boy, he overheard a family doctor say that he wouldn't live beyond his teenage years. \"Put yourself in that position,\" said Dodd. \"So, he was ambitious. He was driven. He was always on the go. He was trying to jam it all in, 'cause he knew he didn't have time.\"",
      "With no time to waste, he began writing songs, and at 22, Bobby Darin made waves with a recording of \"Splish Splash.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Splish Splash\" (1958):",
      "Not one to play it safe, for his second album, in 1959, Darin took a dark ballad from the German \"Threepenny Opera\" and made it swing. \"When my dad took 'Mack the Knife' before it was released and had Dick Clark listen to it, he said, 'Why are you doing this? This is gonna bomb!'\" Dodd said.",
      "It won the Grammy for record of the year, and became the biggest hit of Darin's career.",
      "The next year, he was on his way to Italy to make his motion picture debut opposite America's sweetheart, Sandra Dee. \"We hit it right off,\" Darin said. \"She hated me and I loved her, and that was it.\"",
      "The teen idol married the teen movie star in December of 1960, and welcomed their son, Dodd, a year later. Dodd would later write, \"My father made his destiny. Destiny made my mother.\"",
      "What did he mean by that? \"Well, my mom went through a lot,\" he said. \"Never really wanted fame. She really didn't crave it. It just sort of happened. Unlike my dad, who loved performing, loved show business.\"",
      "Dee was looking for a home life, said Dodd, but Bobby Darin wasn't ready to slow down. The marriage ended after six years. Darin never stopped playing the clubs.",
      "Sammy Davis Jr. once said that Bobby Darin was the one person he wouldn't want to have to follow. \"Absolutely true,\" said Dodd. \"My dad idolized Sammy.\"",
      "The feeling was mutual, as seen in a 1959 broadcast of \"This Is Your Life\":",
      "Also featured during the episode was Nina, the woman Darin thought was his sister. But almost a decade later he would learn a long-held family secret: Nina was in fact Bobby's mother, having given birth to him out of wedlock as a teenager. Which made Polly, the woman he thought was his mother, his grandmother. \"He was never the same,\" said Dodd. \"He said that his whole life was a lie; he was, like, a fraud. It's just devastating. There's no sugarcoating it.\"",
      "Looking at that tape today, says Dodd, it all seems obvious. \"That's a mother's love,\" he said. \"That's not a sister, okay? That's the adulation of, 'This is my son,' but you can't say it.\"",
      "Dodd, who was seven years old when his father found out, remembers a change in your father from that time: \"I'm not gonna say it's directly attributed to that incident; I'm sure that's part of it. But he got into the Bob Darin stage, you know? He took off his toupee. No more tuxedo. Started doing folk music, protest music, writing music, and dropped out of show business for a while.",
      "\"And that was some of the best times I had with him. He was a regular dude. We were up in Big Sur in a trailer, hanging out. And yeah, he let his hair down, if you will. It was good times.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Simple Song of Freedom\" (1970):",
      "In December of 1973, Bobby Darin's heart finally gave out. He was 37. Dodd had just turned 12. Now 63, Dodd Darin is grateful that, with the new Broadway show, a new generation can learn the story of his father.",
      "\"It's so beautiful that all these years later \u2013 he's been gone over 50 years \u2013 we're here talking about him. We're remembering him,\" said Dodd. \"He did something right.\"",

    "summary": "In 1925, a tragic tale of striving featuring an enigmatic millionaire was published \u2013 and it bombed. Since then, its reputation has only grown, to where many consider \"The Great Gatsby\" the Great American Novel.",
    "story": [
      "Dotting the water's edge of Long Island's Manhasset Bay, the opulence of the homes speaks for itself. But not nearly as well as F. Scott Fitzgerald once spoke of that opulence:",
      "\"A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other, like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling.\"",
      "That \"wedding cake\" of a ceiling, in a home now owned by Elena and George Schietinger, likely did look down on Gatsbyesque parties back in the day. \"I can almost hear the music playing and feel the spirits of the parties that went on here,\" said Elena.",
      "\"The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo.\"",
      "Fitzgerald lived in a much more modest house just a few miles away when he was writing \"The Great Gatsby.\" The Schietingers, though, believe the author must have visited here. They imagine him, while tilting his head back to down a bootleg cocktail, and taking note, and then writing their ceiling into his novel. \"I absolutely believe that to be true,\" said George.",
      "Fitzgerald's novel came out a hundred years ago this month. Scholars consider it a literary masterpiece. Hollywood finds it irresistible, and so does Broadway. There's even a recent graphic novel of \"Gatsby\" that brings Fitzgerald's characters to life, starting with James Gatz, who believed he was too poor to marry the rich girl of his dreams \u2013 and so he reinvents himself. It's less about love, and more about longing \u2013 his especially, for Daisy Buchanan just across the bay.",
      "They were so near, and yet worlds apart.",
      "\"I hadn't realized that either side of the bay, that they were so close to one another,\" said Blake Hazard, the great-granddaughter of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. \"I mean, you almost could look into the windows on the other side.\"",
      "She says her celebrated relatives are looming lovingly large on this centennial. \"I've gotten used to witnessing these kinds of things about my family, about my great-grandfather with other people, sharing it, and I think that feels right,\" Hazard said.",
      "Gatsby Tours have become popular, including one run by Kevin C. Fitzpatrick, an author and New York historian.",
      "\"There's a point we're in the middle of Manhasset Bay, and you can look to the left to West Egg and to the right to East Egg, and \u2013 it clicks,\" he said, \"because they can picture that green light on that dock.\"",
      "Few of those mansions remain \u2013 most never survived the Great Depression, torn down to make room for the new.",
      "From the archives: Death of the \"Great Gatsby House\" (YouTube Video)",
      "But back in Manhattan, some of the Gatsby lore remains, especially at the Plaza Hotel and its revolving doors. \"There are stories that Zelda would come in here and just go around and around and around,\" Hazard said.",
      "It was a temple to the times, where important people did important things, including Hazard's great-grandparents. \u00a0\"They both really wanted to be in the world, of the world, writing about what they saw, chronicling it all \u2026 and having a great time doing it,\" she said.",
      "The Fitzgeralds were not wealthy themselves. While they did enjoy money, they were amused with its perils, too.",
      "\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy. They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money, or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together.\"",
      "Hazard said, \"He was drawn to these things, but also very much an observer of them; he felt very outside of, certainly, the wealthy set.\"",
      "Fitzgerald did rub elbows with the wealthy set at Princeton University. Although he later dropped out, his papers found their way back, including the only surviving handwritten manuscript of \"Gatsby,\" which Emma Sarconi, a rare book librarian at Princeton's Special Collections at the Firestone Library, showed us.",
      "\"Here we have half a page scribbled out. The whole book is like this,\" she said.",
      "At the time, Fitzgerald was coming off two big hits: \"This Side of Paradise\" and \"The Beautiful and Damned.\" He believed that \"Gatsby\" would surpass both of them. But \"Gatsby\" landed with a thud, selling less than 20,000 copies. And according to Sarconi, the mixed reviews left him devastated: \"He wrote a letter to his daughter, Scottie, sort of in his final years, lamenting the fact that none of her friends would know who he was,\" she said.",
      "So, what changed? The times, perhaps. During World War II, the newly-formed Council on Books in Wartime shipped millions of pocket-sized books to keep the troops entertained overseas, including 155,000 copies of \"The Great Gatsby.\"\u00a0 \"We wouldn't be talking about this book today if this edition hadn't come out,\" Sarconi said.",
      "Fitzgerald had died long before that, at the age of 44. At that point he thought that he was a failure. \"He had really fallen into obscurity,\" said Sarconi. \"Famously, very few people attended his funeral.\"",
      "And yet today, \"Gatsby\" rubs dust jackets with the likes of Jane Austen, John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway. For many, \"The Great Gatsby\" is indeed the Great American Novel.",
      "\"It sounds silly, but I wish Scott could be here, I just think he'd be so thrilled,\" said Hazard, \"and surprised. Certainly surprised!\"",
      "Among the few keepsakes that Blake has are a necklace given to Zelda by Scott, as well as a ring. Is it a coincidence the stone is green? We'll never know.",
      "Still, that haunting green light still blinks for all of us; dreams, perfection, whatever eludes us \u2013 we keep trying.",
      "\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly, into the past.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/conclave-film-pope-francis-vatican/",
    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 12:43:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Oscar-winning film \"Conclave\" has become a surprise streaming hit amid renewed curiosity about the Vatican's inner workings.",
    "story": [
      "Roman Catholic cardinals have begun assembling at the Vatican to schedule the upcoming conclave\u2014the secretive process that will elect Pope Francis' successor\u2014as mourners continue filing through Saint Peter's Square to pay their final respects to the late pontiff.",
      "A film released last year has sparked new interest in the process to choose a new pontiff.",
      "What is the papal conclave?",
      "The papal conclave\u2014a centuries-old tradition that will determine Pope Francis's successor\u2014will begin 15 to 20 days after his death. Behind the locked doors of the Sistine Chapel, only Cardinal Electors under 80 years old (approximately 135 cardinals) will participate in this secretive process.",
      "Tuesday's preliminary meeting marked the first in a series leading to the conclave. During the actual conclave, cardinals will cast paper ballots in complete privacy until one candidate achieves a two-thirds-plus-one majority. After each voting round, the ballots are burned\u2014sending black smoke through the chapel's chimney to indicate no decision, or white smoke when a new pope has been selected.",
      "The papal transition has renewed interest in \"Conclave,\" a Hollywood film about the secretive papal selection process. Released last year, the movie stars Ralph Fiennes as Cardinal Lawrence, Stanley Tucci as Cardinal Bellini, John Lithgow as Cardinal Tremblay and Isabella Rossellini as Sister Agnes.",
      "Since the pope's death on Monday after suffering a stroke and heart failure at the age of 88, it has become the second most-watched movie worldwide on Amazon Prime.",
      "The film garnered critical acclaim, winning a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Ensemble and an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.",
      "How accurately does \"Conclave\" portray the process?",
      "\"I really enjoyed the movie. It's a great drama, great music, great costumes, good dialog,\" said Father Thomas Reese, a senior analyst at Religion News Service who has studied conclaves extensively. \"But I noticed the little things that were wrong.\"",
      "One significant inaccuracy involves a secretly appointed cardinal who appears to participate in the conclave.",
      "\"No, he would never be allowed in,\" Reese explained. \"Cardinals have to be publicly proclaimed, announced by the pope.\"",
      "However, Reese confirms that the film accurately depicts the political dynamics among cardinals.",
      "\"The church is a divine institution, but it's also a human institution. So there is a lot of discussion, a lot of lobbying,\" he said.",
      "The movie's portrayal of voting procedures within the Sistine Chapel largely reflects reality, according to Reese.",
      "\"Certainly the whole process in the Sistine Chapel of how they vote, how they go up one by one and promise to elect the best person as pope,\" he said.",
      "Pope Francis' funeral has been scheduled for 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET) on Saturday in front of St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican announced. Watch live coverage of the Mass on CBS, CBS News 24/7\u00a0 and Paramount+.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 20:05:40 -0400",
    "summary": "Some FDA scientists and inspections staff were told that their layoffs may be rescinded.",
    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials have told some scientists and inspections staff that their layoffs will be reversed, after the job cuts led to disruptions in drug and food safety work.",
      "The move marks a significant reversal of a portion of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs. Kennedy initially planned to cut 3,500 employees from the FDA.",
      "In team-wide meetings that started last week, multiple FDA employees said they were informed by their supervisors that they should expect to have their layoffs reversed.",
      "Among the laid-off staff told they would be brought back are scientists for drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit as well as food safety labs\u00a0in Chicago and San Francisco. A handful of support staff for the FDA's inspectors are also being brought back.",
      "Multiple FDA scientists said they were eager to go back to work, though they had yet to receive official paperwork for reversing the layoffs.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the FDA's food safety labs were being reinstated.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services blamed errors in the layoffs on inaccurate data from the department's \"siloed HR divisions.\"",
      "\"This is exactly why HHS is reorganizing its administrative functions to streamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us by the Biden Administration. Streamlining this into one operation will allow for enhanced data integrity and coordination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said some layoffs would be walked back, like to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's lead poisoning teams. But that reversal never ended up happening, leaving the agency's lead poisoning work largely abandoned.",
      "Some CDC laboratories also remain closed, including the agency's now-shuttered labs for investigating outbreaks of hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases or for worker safety, like oversight of N95 masks.",
      "FDA inspections falling behind",
      "Around two dozen of the support staff for the FDA's inspectors have been told their layoffs would be reversed, out of nearly 200 who were cut. The employees being restored are focused on booking travel for foreign inspections.",
      "Cuts to the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations have taken a steep toll on the agency's inspections, especially for overseas manufacturers of drugs and food products.",
      "A pilot program started under the Biden administration to expand unannounced foreign inspections stalled due to the cuts, multiple officials said. In a recent week, one FDA official said less than 60% of the agency's planned foreign inspections had been completed.",
      "Sidelined inspectors of foreign firms have been asked to find ways to \"pivot to\" local inspections they can do within the U.S. instead, according to internal emails shared with CBS News. More than $700,000 of expenses incurred by inspectors have also yet to be paid, an official said, due to the layoffs to support staff.",
      "Hopes by FDA leaders to increase inspections have also run up against an ongoing federal hiring freeze, officials said, especially as the ranks of supervisors for inspectors have been depleted by early retirements and resignations.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary had initially greenlighted a plan to use contractors to fill the gap, before the department moved to reverse some of the layoffs.",
      "FDA drug safety work stalls",
      "Multiple current and laid-off FDA employees said the abrupt layoffs had resulted in delays and disruptions to the agency's drug safety work. Virtually all the scientists in the FDA's San Juan and Detroit labs were cut, leaving only labs in New York and Irvine, California.",
      "The FDA labs in Detroit and San Juan had also been responsible for checking the shelf life of medical treatments stockpiled by the federal government for the military and pandemics, under a program administered by the Department of Defense.",
      "The layoffs also cut chemists based out of the labs who worked as foreign inspectors for the FDA, often assigned to travel with badge-carrying investigators to help with more complex or urgent frontline inspections of drugmakers.",
      "Some of the agency's work to detect and investigate fraudulent medical products had also effectively stalled, they said, amid complications around transferring the custody of the samples and a backlog of work that predated the April 1 layoffs.",
      "The FDA's labs had already been struggling with new hurdles to purchasing that had slowed their work, as staff waited for weeks in some cases for supply orders, officials said.",

      "\"We are not creating an autism registry. The real-world data platform will link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies,\" an official for the department told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",
      "Some providers diagnosing and treating people with autism have been deluged by requests to scrub their data and cancel appointments, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, over concerns about patient privacy and worries it would be used to support unfounded claims.",
      "News of the HHS reversal contradicting Bhattacharya was first reported by STAT News.",
      "The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases.",
      "The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry.",
      "Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\"",
      "According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the NIH said its \"secure data repository\" would \"analyze large-scale, de-identified data\" for autism and chronic diseases, similar to the agency's cancer database.

      "\"Funding for the gift cards comes out of California's bird flu state emergency declaration funds. CDC does testing only and offers no incentives of any kind,\" a spokesperson for the California Department of Public Health said in an email.",
      "The effort runs contrary to rumors on social media that states have stopped testing symptomatic farmworkers for bird flu, at the behest of the CDC under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "\"There has been no change to our guidance for testing suspect cases, we are not aware of any symptomatic workers not being referred or tested for H5N1, and it is very unlikely that testing would be declined if H5N1 was suspected,\" the California spokesperson said.",

      "Authorities in neighboring Nevada told CBS News they are also continuing to offer testing and treatment to farm workers exposed to bird flu infections in their animals. In Idaho, another state that had seen bird flu infections in farms, authorities said they had not heard of symptomatic workers being discouraged from getting tested.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 13:06:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP is unlikely to reach its lofty goal in spending cuts without paring back Medicaid, the safety net that helps more than 70 million people.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans are facing the difficult task of slashing $1.5 trillion \u2014 with hundreds of billions likely in Medicaid spending \u2014 to help offset the cost of President Trump's tax cuts.",
      "House leadership has denied that Medicaid \u2014 a joint federal-state health insurance program that provides care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities \u2014 will be gutted. But it's unclear how Republicans plan to reach the level of spending cuts laid out in the budget resolution that Congress adopted earlier this month without drastically trimming the program.",
      "The resolution directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, to find at least $880 billion in savings over 10 years as part of the package central to Mr. Trump's domestic agenda. Cuts to Medicare, which provides health coverage for seniors, are off the table, leaving Medicaid funding as the most likely way to reach that target.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently calculated that achieving those savings would not be possible without cuts to Medicaid, which accounts for 93% of non-Medicare mandatory spending under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Projected spending for programs other than Medicare and Medicaid totals $581 billion, meaning that even if the committee eliminated all other non-mandatory spending, which is highly unlikely, it would still come up short of the $880 billion goal.",
      "Republicans have vowed to protect benefits for eligible recipients, and some have suggested that overhauling the program could help them reach their target instead of cutting benefits.",
      "\"We're going to protect the benefits that everyone is legally entitled to, the beneficiaries who have a legal right to that, it will be preserved. Those are essential safety net programs that Republicans support. The president has made clear: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid will not take a hit. So you can count on that,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said on April 10.",
      "Johnson argued that there's billions in waste, fraud and abuse and said Republicans are considering Medicaid work requirements.",
      "\"We can find well more than $800 billion in savings, and we will,\" Johnson pledged.",
      "Rep. Jodey Arrington of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, estimated at least $160 billion could be saved by kicking ineligible recipients off of Medicaid.",
      "But Joan Alker, the executive director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said \"there's no way to achieve those savings without cutting health care for millions of seniors in nursing homes, children, parents, veterans, caregivers, people with cancer or disabilities.\"",
      "\"Nobody gets a Medicaid check in the mail, and there are already processes in place to go after bad actors like fake labs or unscrupulous providers filing false Medicaid claims,\" she said. \"Proposals to cut fraud would fund more prosecutors and investigators to ferret out criminal activity but that is not what Congress is doing \u2014 these are just proposals to cut Medicaid.\"",
      "Another proposal under consideration is moving more of the cost sharing to the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Forty states have adopted the Medicaid expansion, and under that provision, the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees while the states are responsible for 10%. The federal government's portion for those covered through traditional Medicaid can range from 50% to 83%.",
      "Rep. Austin Scott, a Georgia Republican, said there are discussions about cutting the federal match for Medicaid expansion back to the traditional level.",
      "\"Nobody would be kicked off Medicaid as long as the governors decided that they wanted to continue to fund the program,\" Scott said in an interview with Fox Business on Monday. \"We are going to ask the states to pick up and pay some of the additional percentage.\"",
      "The federal government would save $626 billion over a decade if states assumed more of the expansion costs, according to a KFF analysis. If states are unable to shoulder the costs and eliminate the expansion, federal Medicaid spending would decrease by $1.7 trillion, the analysis found. The Medicaid expansion covers more than 20 million low-income adults, who would lose coverage if states are unable to pick up the expansion costs.",
      "Last week, a dozen House Republicans in battleground districts wrote a letter to leadership and Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican, that warned they would not support a final reconciliation bill that includes \"any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.\"",
      "\"Balancing the federal budget must not come at the expense of those who depend on these benefits for their health and economic security,\" they wrote. \"Cuts to Medicaid also threaten the viability of hospitals, nursing homes, and safety-net providers nationwide. Many hospitals\u2014particularly in rural and underserved areas\u2014rely heavily on Medicaid funding, with some receiving over half their revenue from the program alone. Providers in these areas are especially at risk of closure, with many unable to recover. When hospitals close, it affects all constituents, regardless of healthcare coverage.\"",
      "The issue will come to a head in the coming weeks. The Energy and Commerce Committee plans to mark up its portion of the reconciliation package on May 7.",

    "summary": "\"That just made me so mad,\" one laid-off FDA scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the\u00a0Food and Drug Administration\u00a0has repeatedly claimed in recent interviews that no scientists have been laid off at his agency, but one of the scientists in a food safety lab shuttered by the FDA's cuts says he is either \"blatantly lying\" or \"out of touch.\"",
      "\"There were no layoffs to scientists or food inspectors,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CNN on Wednesday. Makary previously said in an\u00a0April 17\u00a0interview with Megyn Kelly that there \"were not cuts to scientists, or reviewers, or\u00a0inspectors. Absolutely none.\"",
      "\"That just made me so mad, that he said no scientists were cut,\" said one laid-off FDA scientist, a chemist who had worked for the agency for years.",
      "Nearly all of the scientists at food safety laboratories run by the FDA in the San Francisco and Chicago areas received layoff notices this month, four laid-off chemists and microbiologists said. The scientists, who were not authorized to speak publicly, spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "The San Francisco lab, opened during the first Trump administration, had been ramping up testing of infant formula. Its closure has now reduced the agency's baby formula testing capacity by a quarter, at a time when Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0has called for stepped up testing, laid-off scientists said.",
      "\"Do you know and you're blatantly lying? Or do you not know, and you're just that out of touch,\" the chemist said of Makary's comments.",
      "An FDA spokesperson said that the labs were planned to be decommissioned by the agency before the reorganization by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency and Kennedy that resulted in the layoffs. The spokesperson declined to comment on the discrepancy between Makary's remarks and the layoffs.",
      "Most of the staff at those labs have not been back in the building since\u00a0April 1, when they packed up their belongings.",
      "Like other laid-off employees at the FDA, the scientists received a \"reduction in force\" notice that they were being put on leave and would be let go from the FDA on June 2. The letters said that their \"duties have been identified as either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.\"",
      "For now, a handful of employees say they have been asked back to work for a few more weeks, but only to start the process of shuttering their former labs, disposing of samples and supplies.",
      "They were previously responsible for everything from researching the safety of new techniques of food processing to investigating food products for contamination with toxic metals.",
      "Scientists in the San Francisco lab had been the only ones able to test for\u00a0bird flu contamination\u00a0in pet food in the agency's network, multiple FDA officials said. The lab's scientists were the only ones with the expertise and specialized \"biocontainment infrastructure\" to do the testing, a memo shared with CBS News circulated among agency officials said.",
      "Scientists in that lab had also been responsible for major food safety investigations in recent years, given its proximity to major agricultural producers in the region. More than half of the fresh produce in the U.S. is grown in Northern and Central California.",
      "Outbreak investigators would often rush samples back to the lab for testing, multiple laid-off scientists recounted, sometimes requiring staff in the lab to work through the weekends and holidays.",
      "\"Every day they were getting samples, five or six samples a day. During the onion outbreak, oh my goodness, there were onions everywhere. The whole lab smelled like onions,\" one laid-off scientist in the San Francisco lab recalled of their work during the 2024 investigation of\u00a0contaminated onions\u00a0used in McDonald's Quarter Pounders.",
      "The FDA had also recently poured tens of millions of dollars into moving and updating the San Francisco lab to a new location, scientists and officials said. It had a ribbon-cutting near the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "FDA officials at the time touted the lab as critical for a range of food safety testing efforts. It had a lab set up to be free of any metal, needed for advanced investigations into products that could be contaminated with toxic heavy metals like lead and cadmium.",
      "The agency had also purchased new technology for the lab to test food for unapproved color dyes that had been added to products, which could pose a safety risk.",
      "\"FDA scientists will be able to process samples of food and other products and to detect dangerous components, like heavy metals, with extraordinary sensitivity: in the parts-per-trillion range,\" Dr. Amy Abernethy, one of the agency's top officials during the end of the first Trump administration,\u00a0said in 2019\u00a0at the lab's reopening.",
      "Scientists there had been preparing to ramp up testing of baby formula as part of \"Operation Stork Speed,\" ordered by Kennedy\u00a0earlier this year\u00a0to increase checks for heavy metal contaminants. They were also working on launching the capacity to analyze the nutrients in baby formula, which only one other lab in the FDA's network is equipped to do.",
      "\"We have a lot of brand new equipment that's sitting on the bench waiting to be used. We have to do massive verification, validation before we can start analysis. So we were in the middle of that. Now, all of those brand new equipment will go to waste,\" one laid-off scientist said.",
      "Multiple FDA scientists said they estimated it would likely take millions of dollars and months of work to formally shut down the lab, let alone to transfer their workload to the FDA's remaining scientists.",
      "\"The other labs, they are overwhelmed with some samples because we're not doing the testing anymore,\" one laid-off scientist said.",

    "story": [
      "UPS on Tuesday announced it is planning to cut 20,000 jobs this year, part of a cost-cutting effort that's linked to the delivery giant's decision to deliver fewer packages from Amazon, its biggest customer.",
      "The shipping company, which operates in over 200 countries, currently has around 490,000 employees. The layoffs will impact slightly over 4% of its workforce. This follows an announcement from UPS last year that it would cut 12,000 positions.",
      "The move is part of the company's plan to consolidate UPS's facilities and workforce. Along with the job cuts, the company announced it will also close 73 of its buildings by the end of June 2025 and said that it may target additional buildings for closure.",
      "\"These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability,\" Brian Dykes, the chief financial officer of UPS said during an earnings call on Tuesday morning.",
      "In a Tuesday regulatory filing, UPS said the cuts are in \"connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.\" The company, which announced $21.5 billion in revenue for this past quarter, expects to save $3.5 billion this year as a result of its consolidation plan.",
      "According to Sean M. O'Brien, the Teamsters general president, UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under their current national master agreement.",
      "\"If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won't stand in its way,\" O'Brien said. \"But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.\"",
      "\"Strong\" relationship with Amazon",
      "The company in January\u00a0said it had reached an agreement with Amazon to decrease its delivery volume by more than 50% in the second half of 2026.",
      "\"The reduction of package volume from Amazon is something UPS chose to do as we focus on revenue quality, and increase domestic operating margin and profitability,\" a UPS spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",

      "UPS shares slipped 55 cents, or 0.6%, to $96.61 in afternoon trading.",
      "Trade risks rising",
      "In its\u00a0quarterly earnings statement, the company also mentioned the risk that shifts in global trade policy could have on business. The Trump administration has introduced sweeping new tariffs in recent months that have already began to impact the flow of goods in and out of the country, and around the world.",
      "UPS handles roughly 400,000 imported parcels each day, or roughly 2% of the packages they move on a daily basis. Still, the company could be impacted if the trade war between China and the U.S. continues.",
      "\"From a revenue perspective, last year, revenue on our China to U.S. trade lanes represented 11% of our total international revenue,\" said CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said during Tuesday's earning call. \"Our China to U.S. trade lines are our most profitable trade lines.\"",
      "UPS is keeping customers abreast of tariff developments on its\u00a0website. It has also introduced a\u00a0tool\u00a0called UPS Global Checkout that shows online shoppers the upfront costs they will have to pay in duties, fees and taxes.",

    "story": [
      "In the last week, President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims that the prices of everyday items like gas and groceries have fallen since he took office \u2014 even as Americans are starting to face surcharges for some items as a result of his tariff hikes.",
      "While Mr. Trump touts his economic record in interviews with the press, he has claimed without evidence that consumers are seeing record low prices at their gas pumps and exaggerated the decline in crude oil prices since he took office. The president has also falsely stated that he has overseen a drop in grocery prices.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's false claim that gas hit $1.98 a gallon in some places",
      "Trump said April 22: \"I see that we had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon. Nobody thought they'd see that for years maybe.\"",
      "Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that gas prices dropped to a low of $1.98 in a few states in April, hitting lows not seen since his first term. However, that is not true; on average, gas prices are around the same as when the president took office in January.",
      "Data from the Energy Information Administration shows a national average of about $3.14 per gallon of regular gas as of the third week in April \u2014 which is slightly higher than the $3.11 the week Mr. Trump was inaugurated.",
      "GasBuddy, a company that tracks prices at more than 150,000 gas stations across the country, told CBS News it had not found evidence of a gas station selling gas for $1.98 per gallon in April.",
      "Patrick De Haan, who leads petroleum analysis with the company, said the lowest price they could find in April was $2.19 at a gas station in Texas.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim that gas prices are at their lowest level since his first term is also not true; gas prices were lower than they are now for the first six months of Biden's presidency.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for more information on the president's claim.",
      "Trump's partially true claim that crude oil prices have dropped significantly since he took office",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"Energy is down and we're about $64 a barrel.\u00a0 When I came in\u2013 and we were looking at $89, $90, $95.\"",
      "The president also claimed crude oil prices dropped to about $64 a barrel, from around $89 when he took office.",
      "A White House spokesman said the president was referring to the price per barrel of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark. According to data from FactSet, Mr. Trump accurately described the current price of Brent crude, which was about $64 a barrel on April 28, but he also exaggerated the price at the time he assumed office, which was about $80. The White House did not explain the discrepancy.",
      "According to a recent Energy Information Administration report, Mr. Trump's tariff hikes in early April contributed to declines in oil prices as traders weighed the potential impact on global demand. An early April announcement that OPEC members would increase oil production ahead of schedule also added to the downward pressure on prices.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that the price of groceries came down since he took office",
      "Trump said April 24: \"Groceries are down.\" Trump said April 17: \"Food is down. Groceries, as we call it, are down.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that grocery prices have declined since he took office. However, Consumer Price Index data shows average cost of groceries in March increased by 0.49% from the previous month and by 2.4% compared to the previous year.",
      "Prices vary across products, and the White House said the president was referring to declines in the consumer prices of certain grocery store items like fresh vegetables. The USDA's Food Price Outlook shows that fresh vegetable prices decreased 1.1% in March, after falling by 1.7% in February. However, the same report also shows the prices of beef, poultry, eggs, and nonalcoholic beverages all ticked up in March.",
      "These increases occurred before the president imposed a baseline 10% tariff on goods from most countries in early April as well as tariffs as high as 145% on imports from China. Economists expect the prices of some grocery store items, including coffee and chocolate, will rise as a result, which could be reflected when data for April is released in the coming weeks.",
      "Trump's false claim that egg prices have gone down 87%",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House, thousands and thousands of eggs, and the price was down 87% so we did a great job.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that egg prices are down significantly, without clarifying whether he is referring to wholesale or consumer prices. The president has a point that wholesale prices have declined since he took office, but he overstates the size of the decline. And recent data suggests consumer prices remain elevated.",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 what large buyers such as Costco or Walmart pay producers \u2014 have dropped sharply since mid-March as egg losses due to bird flu decreased last month. U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows wholesale egg prices were roughly 52% lower on April 25 than they were at the start of Mr. Trump's second term. The White House did not explain the discrepancy in the president's figures.",
      "Meanwhile, retail prices for consumers remain at record highs. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released on April 10 shows average retail egg prices hit $6.23 per dozen in March, surpassing the previous record $5.90 set in February.",
      "A March 28 report from the Department of Agriculture said it can take \"up to three weeks\" for consumers to benefit from the wholesale price decline.

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:55:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Despite President Trump's promise of cuts, the federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days than the same time period last year.",
    "story": [
      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories. Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "But even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent about $220 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",
      "Musk recently said his work with DOGE is winding down.",
      "Explore the spending details yourself",
      "You can explore the government's daily account ledgers for yourself. We've isolated the money spent by category in the first few months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period in each of the last 10 years.",
      "You can search for agencies or spending categories below to see the change over time and how much or less is being spent during this first 100 days of the Trump administration. We've limited the table to agencies and categories with at least $100 million in spending since Jan. 20, 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are dropping sharply with the Trump administration's steep tariffs in place, leading major U.S. retailers to warn about impending supply shortages.",
      "The trade war between China and the U.S. has escalated over the past few weeks, with each nation hiking its import duties multiple times in a tit-for-tat. While Trump has given other countries a 90-day pause on the tariffs, as their leaders pledged to negotiate with the U.S., China has remained the exception.",
      "U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%. China, meanwhile, has hit back with 125% tariffs on U.S. products.",
      "At the Port of Los Angeles, which, along with the Port of Long Beach, receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia, shipments last week were down 10% compared with the same period one year earlier. That number is expected to keep falling.",
      "\"We are now beginning to see the flow of cargo to the Port of Los Angeles slow,\" Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka said at a Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners meeting on April 24. \"It's my prediction that in two weeks time, arrivals will drop by 35%,\" he added.",
      "U.S. retailers had rushed to import goods into the country ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariffs going into effect, leading to a spike in imports since last summer. Now, with the 145% tariffs making goods from China roughly two-and-a-half times more expensive than they were last year, \"essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,\" Seroka said.",
      "By another estimate, container bookings from China to the U.S. are down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company.",
      "The dip comes during what is usually a busy period for imports to the U.S. \"We would normally see an increase in bookings across the board, because this is the beginning of the shipping year,\" said Nathan Strang, director of ocean freight at Flexport. \"It's when back-to-school items and Halloween items start to come in.\"",
      "What's more, retailers have likely stockpiled sufficient inventory to last a couple of months, Seroka said, adding that come summer, consumers could find that many products are out of stock. All manner of goods flow through the Port of Los Angeles to end up in households across the U.S.",
      "The port's top five import categories are furniture, auto parts, clothing, plastics and footwear, a port spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Empty shelves?",
      "Major retailers and small establishments alike are warning that consumers could soon face tariff-related inventory shortages. Goods that do land on store shelves could be subject to price hikes, once \"tariff surcharges\" are added.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chef economist at private equity firm Apollo Global Management, said in a recent blog post that tariffs will\u00a0lead to \"empty shelves in U.S. stores in a few weeks and COVID-like shortages for consumers and for firms using Chinese products as intermediate goods.\"",
      "Last week, the CEOs of Walmart and Target privately cautioned\u00a0President Trump that his sweeping tariff policy could lead to gaps on store shelves, if it remains in effect,\u00a0Axios first reported.",
      "\"We had a productive meeting with President Trump and his team and appreciated the opportunity to share our insights,\" Walmart\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "Target also said in a statement that it \"had a productive meeting with President Trump and our retail peers to discuss the path forward on trade, and we remain committed to delivering value for American consumers.\"",
      "Both retailers had previously publicly warned that the levies could lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"We never want to raise prices,\" but \"there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey\u00a0told CNBC.",
      "Last month, Target CEO Brian Cornell\u00a0told CNBC, \"the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days\" as a result of tariffs planned on imports from Mexico.",
      "Widespread booking freeze",
      "Logistics groups are also reporting sharp declines in cargo shipments from China.",
      "For the week of April 14, booking volumes from China to the U.S. dropped 45% compared with the same period one year earlier, according to Vizion, a container tracking service.",
      "\"This dramatic drop aligned with two key developments: the April 4th U.S. tariff announcement, followed by China's retaliatory measures announced on April 5th. The result? A widespread booking freeze, as shippers paused mid-shipment cycle to reassess costs, timelines and broader trade strategy,\" Vizion said in a report.",

    "summary": "Early in his second term, President Trump is struggling to deliver on his campaign trail promises to invigorate the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "During his campaign last year, President Trump repeatedly attacked former President Joe Biden for his handling of the economy, vowing to boost economic growth and\u00a0lower inflation. But 100 days into his second term in the White House, the president is struggling to deliver on those promises.",
      "Mr. Trump's signature policies on trade, immigration and government spending have not only failed to spark economic growth \u2014 they're contributing to a sharp contraction in activity and threaten to re-ignite inflation, data shows. Economists also\u00a0warn that the chances of a U.S. recession\u00a0are rising.",
      "For millions of employers around the country, the Trump administration's helter-skelter approach to imposing tariffs on key trading partners, along with just about every other country on the planet,\u00a0has been challenging, corporate executives and small business owners have told CBS News.",
      "\"I can't think of a precedent for anything like this,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch of the impact of Mr. Trump's first 100 days on the economy.",
      "\"President Reagan, for instance, implemented a lot of changes in terms of tax policy and defense spending and cuts, and those things had big impacts,\" she added, \"but the element here that's quite different is the approach, which has been quite inconsistent and chaotic.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's loyal base of supporters continues to voice support, among other voters there's also a widespread and growing belief that the administration is too focused on\u00a0tariffs\u00a0and not focused enough on lowering prices, according to CBS News polling about the president's first 100 days in office.",
      "Such concerns come as the White House makes a sharp break with the country's traditional playbook on global trade. The result, say critics, includes the highest tariffs in more than a century; sudden, confusing\u00a0shifts in tariff policy\u00a0and major damage to the U.S.' geopolitical relationships.",
      "\"Tariffs have been an unmitigated disaster, economically,\" former Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican and erstwhile economics professor at Texas A&M University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There's no doubt about it that the tariff policy in and of itself will drive up prices because tariffs are a tax. And remember, 61% of imports are component parts to be used in the production of goods and services in America.\"",
      "Gramm added, \"I want to emphasize that the harm of tariffs isn't just inflation \u2014 it's what they do for efficiency and economic growth.\"",
      "The Trump administration stands by its economic record to date, with White House spokesman Kush Deai saying in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that \"President Trump's America First policies are delivering much-needed economic relief for everyday Americans while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness.\"",
      "\"Within 100 days of President Trump's second term in office, Americans saw the first monthly price drop in years in the March inflation report, while industry leaders ranging from Apple to Hyundai to Nvidia have made trillions in historic investment commitments to reshore manufacturing back to the United States,\" Desai added. \"President Trump delivered a historic economy in his first term, and he's running back the success in his second term.\"",
      "Economic slowdown",
      "Already, the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing. Business surveys in April suggest the U.S. is headed for \"a sluggish pace of growth,\" according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, which pointed to what it calls an \"an existential crisis\" for businesses, created by Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The country's gross domestic product \u2014 the total annual value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S. \u2014 is forecast to slow to 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, a sharp decline from 2.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, according to economists polled by financial services firm FactSet. For the year, economic growth is predicted to slow to 1.9%, versus 2.8% in 2024, FactSet data shows.",
      "Economists warn that the U.S. could slip into a recession due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists largely gave the U.S. economy a good rating, pointing to its strong growth, low unemployment and progress in bringing inflation under control.",
      "Businesses large and small say the tariffs will cause disruptions, with almost 900 companies in the last 30 days alone citing the barrage of new U.S. levies in their earnings calls. That compares with 100 mentions in December 2024, according to transcripts posted by FactSet. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Walmart and Target\u00a0privately warned Mr. Trump that the tariffs could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves within weeks.",
      "\"Most businesses plan to pass these costs on to their consumers, which will make things more expensive, and we're going to see cuts in consumer spending as a result,\" Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics said, adding that her firm isn't forecasting a recession although it has pared its GDP outlook. \"That's less revenue for businesses.\"",
      "Inflation fears flare",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" vowing that if he would bring down prices \"very quickly\" in a second term.",
      "But 100 days into his new administration, consumers are skeptical about Mr. Trump's vow to tackle inflation, with 63% telling CBS News in new polling that they believed his policies would cause grocery prices to go up. Only 15% said they believe his administration will help lower their grocery bills.",
      "Consumers are clearly worried about tariffs, with the same CBS News poll finding that 55% of respondents said Mr. Trump doesn't have a clear plan for tariffs and trade. Americans now expect inflation to rise to 6.5% a year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index \u2014 a potentially self-fulling outlook that could cause consumers to pull back on spending.",
      "So far, however, inflation data shows that price increases eased to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February. Falling gas prices have come as a relief for motorists, with the national average for a gallon of regular gas now at $3.17, compared with $3.66 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "Still, many economists forecasts that inflation will pick up later this year as the impact of tariffs works its way through the economy.",
      "The case for tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that his tariff policies will benefit the U.S. economy over the long term. In his view, the cost of the tariffs will spur both U.S. and foreign businesses to expand in the U.S., spawning jobs for American workers and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, some businesses have said they are investing in domestic manufacturing, with Apple planning a $500 billion expansion of its U.S. facilities over four years and IBM on Monday announcing a $150 billion investment to \"fuel the economy.\"",
      "The president also maintains that tariffs will bring in trillions in new federal revenue , helping to offset an extension of his 2017 tax cuts currently being hammered out by Republican lawmakers. But many economists are skeptical that his tariffs could bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods\u00a0when their prices rise.",
      "\"Consumers have to be confident to affect their spending,\" noted Donald Boudreaux, an economist at George Mason University (whose book with Sen. Gramm, \"The Triumph of Economic Freedom: Debunking the Seven Great Myths of American Capitalism,\" will be published next month). \"The current policy is reducing their confidence.\"",
      "For his part, Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the impact of U.S. tariffs will cause \"some pain\" for Americans, while adding in a February social media post that \"IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\"",
      "Market turmoil",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the Trump administration's economic policies has been clear: The S&P 500 index has lost 10% of its value since reaching a post-inauguration high on February 19, putting the broad-based market into correction territory.",
      "The dollar has lost about 9% of its value since Mr. Trump's inauguration, according to the U.S. dollar index, which compares the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies. Typically, investors rush to the bond market in times of economic uncertainty, but in recent weeks\u00a0bond prices have slid and yields have risen \u2014\u00a0 signs investors are rattled by the impact of Trump administration policies.",
      "\"I would emphasize that this movement in the asset markets is indeed unusual, and it happened particularly after April 2, 'Liberation Day',\" or the day when Mr. Trump announced tariffs on almost every nation on Earth, Boudreaux said. \"It can only be explained by global investor fears of what might happen in the U.S. economy.\"",
      "He added, \"It's too soon to tell how far those fears will go, but the early signs aren't cheery.\"",
      "A boost from tax cuts and deregulation?",
      "To be sure, mounting anxieties among consumers, businesses and investors don't by themselves herald an inevitable economic downturn. And so far, the economy remains resilient, with unemployment near a 50-year low and inflation edging down to 2.4% in March.",
      "Some economists also point to what they view as positives in Mr. Trump's agenda, such as prospects for tax cuts and deregulation, which could spur economic growth. And Mr. Trump has touted his administration's efforts to slash federal spending, overseen by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as a win for taxpayers.",
      "\"We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Mr. Trump told Time Magazine in an interview this month.",
      "DOGE, by its account, has cut about $160 billion in costs, or about 2.4% of the federal government's roughly $6.8 trillion in annual spending. But some critics have pointed out that the cuts will ultimately cost taxpayers\u00a0due to rehiring federal workers who were mistakenly fired, lower productivity of remaining workers and through lower tax collections from the IRS, which is reducing its staffing under DOGE's direction.",
      "In the meantime, some observers say the biggest hurdle to Mr. Trump's economic goals is of his own creation.",
      "\"We want Trump to succeed \u2014 in criticizing this trading policy, it's the policy we're criticizing,\" Sen. Gramm said. \"I don't believe the president can achieve what he wants to achieve for America unless his trade policy changes.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:26:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Although attending college still offers a payoff, a recent study by New York Fed economists suggests it might not make financial sense for some people.",
    "story": [
      "Getting a college education has traditionally been seen as a way to move up the economic ladder. But an analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the cost of a degree may not always be worth it.",
      "The value of a college education has increasingly come into question in recent years, especially as tuition costs steadily climb and millions of Americans grapple with student loans. As a result, only one in four U.S. adults say it's extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree to get a well-paying job, according to a 2024\u00a0Pew Research poll.",
      "To be sure, the case for attending college remains strong. Another study by the New York Fed\u00a0found\u00a0that in recent years the typical college graduate with a bachelor's degree had annual income of roughly $80,000, versus $47,000 for people with only a high school diploma \u2014a 68% premium.",
      "Yet a recent study by the Fed bank suggests a college degree hasn't paid off for at least 25% of college graduates in recent decades.",
      "Of course, not everyone goes to college chiefly to earn a high income \u2014 education can be its own reward, after all. But how you\u00a0 navigate your college career \u2014 or whether you choose to attend at all \u2014 is among the most important financial decisions a person will make.",
      "Here's when a diploma may not deliver much of a bang for the buck.",
      "When might a college degree not be worth it?",
      "Not surprisingly, the more a student must spend on out-of-pocket expenses, the lower their typical return on investment. The average college student pays about $30,000 out of pocket for four years of college, according to the New York Fed study. However, students could face significantly higher costs if they choose to live on campus, or if they miss out on financial aid and are forced to pay a school's full price.",
      "The typical college graduate sees a return on investment (ROI) of roughly 12.5% according to the New York Fed. That rate has remained mostly unchanged over the past three decades, and still exceeds the returns on most other investments, including the stock market, which over time offers long-term return of about 8%.",
      "Despite that payoff, certain factors can lower a college grad's ROI. For example, the researchers found that living on campus increased the price tag for college by nearly $30,000 \u2013 from $180,000 to $207,000 \u2013 reducing the return on investment to about 11%. The 1.5% drop in ROI may seem nominal, but it can translate to hundreds of thousands in lost dollars.",
      "\"This extra cost and the associated return are comparable to attending a more expensive school that is roughly twice the average price,\" the researchers, economists\u00a0Jaison Abel and\u00a0Richard Deitz, said in the study.",
      "Among college graduates, 25% actually see little return on investment. This group was making less than $10,000 more in income than the median high school graduate in 2024. Their rate of return was only 2.6% compared to the average of 12.5% \u2014 meaning they see much less of a payoff.",
      "Another factor that can reduce the value of a college degree is how long it takes to obtain. The typical bachelor's program runs for four years, but in some cases students might extend the timeline if they haven't completed their course load. That can have major financial implications.",
      "Taking an extra one to two years to get your degree adds \"considerably to the cost,\" the New York Fed\u00a0found. There's the direct cost students have to pay for the additional tuition, but also higher \"opportunity costs\" \u2014 for example, a student who starts their career later misses out on years of working experience and can end up earning less over their lifetime.",
      "\"All in all, we estimate that taking five years to complete college pushes the median rate of return down to about 9% and taking six years pushes it down to 7%,\" the researchers found.",
      "Graduating in five years, rather than four, pushes up the total cost of college from $180,000 to $272,000, while taking six years would cost $364,000.",
      "How much does a student's major matter?",
      "Another important consideration in deciding if going to college is a sound investment is a student's major. After all, certain fields tend to lead to higher incomes.",
      "So-called STEM majors tend to earn the most, both in the early and mid-stages off their career, according to New York Fed\u00a0data. For instance, a computer engineering major stands to make a median wage of $122,000 mid-career, versus $55,000 for an education major, according to the bank's data.",
      "Among the fields of study with the highest returns are engineering, business and health sciences. The return is lowest for those majoring in fine arts, liberal arts, leisure, and hospitality and education, which ranked last.",
      "\"While some of it may come down to choices people make for the jobs they wish to have, one significant consideration is college major, something over which students have direct control,\" Abel and Dietz wrote.",

    "summary": "The push by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal funding will cost taxpayers money, nonpartisan group finds. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says it has saved $160 billion through its push to root out wasteful or fraudulent government spending. But that effort may also have come at a cost for taxpayers, with a new estimate from a nonpartisan research and advocacy group estimating that DOGE's actions will cost $135 billion this fiscal year.",
      "The analysis seeks to tally the costs associated with putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity, according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce.",
      "PSP's estimate is based on the $270 billion in annual compensation costs for the federal workforce, calculating the impact of DOGE's actions, from paid leave to productivity hits. The $135 billion cost to taxpayers doesn't include the expense of defending multiple lawsuits challenging DOGE's actions, nor the impact of estimated lost tax collections due to staff cuts at the IRS.",
      "DOGE has sought to slash federal spending by urging government workers to accept a deferred resignation plan, which allowed many employees to retain full pay and benefits through September without working. Another 24,000 government employees who were fired as part of the reform effort have since been\u00a0rehired after a court ruling.",
      "Other agencies also have rehired some workers after mistakenly firing them, such as bird flu experts\u00a0who were dismissed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal workers have also had to take on tasks such as documenting their weekly accomplishments, which has lowered productivity, Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We haven't seen much focus on the waste [DOGE] is creating,\" Stier told CBS MoneyWatch about his group's decision to analyze the costs of DOGE's cuts. \"This is an effort that was created to address waste, but we were seeing the opposite.\"",
      "\"Ultimately it's the public that will end up paying for this,\" he added, noting that he expects the taxpayers costs to grow after other DOGE cuts take effect.",
      "The White House took issue with the analysis.",
      "\"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \"The American public are in lockstep with the president's mission and will not be swayed by more lies coming from the legacy media.\"",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE's efforts aren't winning over most voters, with a new\u00a0Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll finding that 57% of Americans disapprove of the way Musk is handling his job in the Trump administration. About 6 in 10 said they're worried President Trump will do too much to cut the size and role of the federal government, the poll found.",
      "Why job cuts could raise costs",
      "The IRS, which is planning on cutting roughly\u00a040% of its workforce, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "To be sure, the DOGE cuts could pay off over time, with a leaner, more focused federal workforce. For example, the direct savings from those layoffs will amount to $38 billion over 10 years, the Partnership for Public Service estimated.",
      "But Stier maintains that the costs for taxpayers could grow as they ripple through the economy, such as reductions in funding of health and science research. One analysis by researchers at institutions including the University of Maryland and University of Pennsylvania estimates that cuts to health research will result in a $16 billion annual economic loss, with 68,000 jobs lost.",
      "\"One can always imagine a miracle occurring, but none of this makes sense on so many different levels,\" Stier said.",
      "DOGE's \"wall of receipts\"",
      "DOGE keeps a running public tally of the federal money the task force says it has saved, posted on its\u00a0website in what is called a \"wall of receipts.\" But some of those savings have been overstated, a February CBS News investigation found.",
      "At the same time, DOGE's $160 billion in savings is far less than Musk's previously stated goal of shrinking annual government spending by $2 trillion, or almost one-third of the federal budget. Many experts say that far more ambitious objective is unlikely to be achieved without cutting major federal programs like Social Security and Medicare, which Mr. Trump has vowed not to touch.",
      "Musk said Tuesday that he'll curtail his work at DOGE starting in May. His decision comes as Tesla, the electric vehicle maker he runs, saw a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit and a 20% decline in vehicle sales as some consumers snubbed the brand due to objections to Musk's government work.",
      "Musk said he still plans to spend one to two days a week on DOGE-related work, focusing on eliminating government waste.",
      "\"I'll have to continue to keep doing it for the remainder of the president's term to make sure the waste and fraud doesn't come roaring back,\" he said during Tesla's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.",

      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",

      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

    "story": [
      "Is 100 days enough time to evaluate this president? His supporters generally don't think so, but others do \u2014 perhaps because most Americans think President Trump is already making major changes to how the government \u2014 and the U.S. economy \u2014 work.",
      "Those opening days, in public opinion terms, have been marked by Mr. Trump's continued support from a loyal base of supporters, but also a widespread and growing belief among others that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. That's weighing on his approval ratings on the economy and inflation, which have gone down.",
      "Alongside that, he continues to get majority approval for his deportation program, though more Americans prioritize the economy in their evaluations of him.",
      "MAGA Republicans, in contrast, say their evaluations are based more on immigration and overwhelmingly approve of his efforts there. Plus they have a much rosier outlook on the U.S. economy than Americans overall now that Trump is in office, and most of them say it is too soon to judge him.",
      "Others who voted for him, but who don't identify as MAGA, have become a little less approving of his handling of the economy and inflation in recent months. And since the start of his term, his approval rating has slid among some groups he made gains with in the 2024 election, including independents, young people, and Hispanic people.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump sees disapproval on the economy from those who think he's put too much focus on tariffs.",
      "And meanwhile, Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove of what they see from him, want their party to oppose him more and say they're \"frustrated\" with the Democratic Party's response so far. Mr. Trump's approval rating among people who sat out the '24 election started out higher, too.",
      "Those perceived changes elicit different judgments, though. Republicans say they are for the better, and Democrats, the worse. Asked how Trump's presidency so far has made them feel, most Republicans say they're satisfied, while Democrats and independents say they're frustrated and nervous.",
      "Measuring a president at 100 days is something of a contrivance that is based on a marker set during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term back in the 1930s. Then again, many presidents come in promising a lot of action quickly. Most Americans do think they can judge this administration in that time frame. Mr. Trump's 2024 voters, and most of his current approvers, are less likely to think it's enough time, whereas his disapprovers think it's enough.",
      "Tariffs, promises and prices",

      "People who think Mr. Trump is putting too much focus on tariffs are more likely to say he's doing different things from what he promised.",
      "Here's how differences on economics play out:",
      "MAGA Republicans stand apart in their outlook for the U.S. economy. While most Americans say it is getting worse, MAGA Republicans say it is getting better. They also rate the current economy much better than others do. So, while evaluations of the economy remain mostly bad, Republicans' views have pushed the overall ratings up a bit, with an even larger partisan gap now.",
      "Overall, more Americans continue to say Trump's policies are making them financially worse off than better off. Expectations at the start of his term were different \u2014 more expected his policies to improve their finances.",
      "Two-thirds of those who think they're being made worse off say he isn't doing what he promised.",
      "And that has led to declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation, specifically. Both ratings are now their lowest levels of the term so far. His rating on inflation is driven very much by the impact of his policies people see on prices.",
      "Support for tariffs has been declining, as a rising number of Americans feel the administration is focusing too much on the issue. And over recent weeks, fewer now believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan for tariffs and trade.",
      "When asked to pick what issue is most important to them in judging the Trump administration, the economy and immigration top the list. Those judging Mr. Trump on immigration heavily approve of his overall job performance, while those judging him on the economy disapprove in large numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump's overall approval rating is down from the high at the start of this term.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "Most Americans think Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings. Most also continue to approve of his deportation program in general.",
      "Meanwhile, three-quarters say it isn't acceptable if some legal residents are detained by mistake as part of that program. A large 8 in 10 say it wouldn't be acceptable if some legal residents are deported to foreign countries.",
      "And most who don't think these things would be acceptable disapprove of his overall handling of immigration.",
      "(On this, MAGA Republicans do stand differently from others, coming in about twice as likely as Americans overall to say legal residents being detained would be acceptable.)",
      "It may be that the perceived implementation of the deportation plan is affecting larger views of how Mr. Trump is handling immigration, even as a majority approve of the deportation program in general. On balance, his handling of immigration, generally, is lower than it was earlier in term. Independents, especially those with college degrees, have become less approving over time.",
      "Most Americans also think Mr. Trump is trying to expand the powers of the presidency \u2014 a view driven heavily by Democrats and those who disapprove of his job performance. And those who think he is are more likely to feel democracy and rule of law in the U.S. is threatened.",
      "Most Americans do support limits to Mr. Trump's powers as president, though. A majority think he should get his policies enacted by working with Congress to pass legislation rather than through executive orders, and majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents alike feel Mr. Trump should follow a Supreme Court ruling if it goes against his administration. Republicans also say their party in Congress should push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree with him.",

      "Senator Ed Markey, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said in a letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) on Friday that smaller enterprises deserve exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs, which the Massachusetts Democrat criticized as \"recklessly imposed.\"",
      "Markey also noted that the Trump administration has moved to shield corporate giants such as Apple and Google from the impact of some its trade policies, and he pressed the White House to protect small businesses. The U.S. earlier this month moved to exempt smartphones, computers and other high-tech products from the new tariffs, a boon to major tech manufacturers.",
      "\"Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, but because they operate on razor-thin margins, they are uniquely vulnerable to rising costs caused by the Trump Tariffs. These businesses simply do not have the financial cushion to absorb price shocks or the resources to navigate sudden changes to an already complex supply channel,\" Markey wrote.",
      "Under President Trump, the U.S. has hiked tariffs on Chinese imports to as much as 145%, while products from most other countries are subject to 10% tariffs. Mr. Trump also announced steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of U.S. trading partners, but earlier this month\u00a0paused them for 90 days.",

      "American consumers are starting to feel the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, especially online.",
      "Since the second week in April, sellers on Amazon have raised their prices on nearly 1,000 products, according to data from SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike \u2014 nearly 30%, according to the company's analysis.",
      "Costs rose on a wide range of items, from tech accessories such as phone chargers to women's clothing, SmartScout founder and CEO Scott Needham told CBS MoneyWatch. Anker, a top-selling brand on Amazon that sells mobile charging devices, has increased prices on roughly 25% of its products on the site, for example.",
      "\"It's one of first concerted efforts I've seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,\" Needham said.",
      "Tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told CNBC\u00a0earlier this month that he expected U.S. tariffs to boost prices on a host of consumer goods.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with levies of 125% on U.S. goods entering the country. Mr. Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices, saying that tariffs will reinvigorate the domestic manufacturing sector and spur economic growth.",
      "Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"Amazon consistently offers the lowest prices across the widest selection. We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Shein, Temu prices also rising",
      "Other major e-commerce players and retailers have also lifted prices to offset higher import costs, sometime by adding \"tariff surcharges\" to customers' bills. Chinese e-commerce sites Shein and Temu each announced\u00a0last week that they would hike prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that had allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "Those price hikes took effect today. On Temu's site, a pair of running sneakers that last week cost $14 now runs about $27.",
      "The jump illustrates retailers' struggles to navigate President Trump's tariff agenda. Sky-high tariffs can make manufacturing goods in countries like China uneconomical. But revamping supply chains or moving manufacturing to another country can take years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions dollars, experts say.",

    "summary": "President Trump said that a baby bonus provided to new parents could be a \"good idea.\" Here's how it's worked in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are having fewer babies, with the annual birth rate now standing near a record low. It's a trend that has implications for the nation's long-term outlook \u2014 and has drawn attention from the Trump administration, with the New York Times reporting that a proposal for a $5,000 \"baby bonus\" may be one option for juicing the birth rate.",
      "\"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" President Trump said on Tuesday at a White House event when asked about the possibility of a federal baby bonus.",
      "Yet the idea may be far from becoming a reality, with a White House official telling CBS MoneyWatch that no final decision on such a plan has been made.",
      "A declining birth rate can spell long-term economic problems, including a shrinking labor force that's financially strapped to pay for medical services and retirement benefits for an aging population. But reversing a nation's declining birth rate could take far more than a one-time payment that, for most parents, would be quickly consumed by the costs of diapers, child care and other essentials.",
      "Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried an array of strategies to revive their birth rates, but in most cases with short-lived results or no impact at all.",
      "Some experts point out that by tackling long-standing economic issues \u2014 such as providing affordable day care and paid parental leave after the birth of a child \u2014 the government could provide a more hospitable environment for families. The U.S. is one of a only a handful of nations that doesn't provide paid leave for parents, including countries such as Papua New Guinea and Suriname.",
      "\"President Trump is proudly implementing policies to uplift American families, from securing order [at the] border to keep violent criminals out of our communities, to lowering taxes and the cost of living,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email in response to a question about the baby bonus idea. \"The President wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream.\"",
      "By 2050, 26 states will take an economic hit due to their aging populations changes, with GDP declining by $162.3 billion from 2050 to 2100 over that period, according to a new analysis from PwC. Those states range from Maine to Mississippi.",
      "Here's what to know about baby bonuses.",
      "How much has the U.S. birth rate declined?",
      "About 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, according to the most recent CDC data. That's little changed from the prior year, when the number of births hit a new record low.",
      "The fertility rate, or the average number of children born to each woman in the U.S., dropped to about 1.6 in 2023, down from 3.7 in 1960, when the nation was in the midst of the post-war baby boom, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "What's causing the decline?",
      "That's unclear from an economic or policy standpoint, according to economists Melissa Kearney of University of Maryland, Philip Levine of Wellesley College and Luke Pardue of the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, the authors of a 2022\u00a0analysis of the birth rate decline in the economics publication Econofact.",
      "But, they added, \"Shifting priorities could be the primary driver for the decline in the birth rate since 2007.\"",
      "Survey and anecdotal data suggests that \"young adults have different preferences for having children, aspirations for life and views about parenting norms that are driving the decline in the U.S. birth rates,\" they wrote.",
      "Could financial incentives increase the birth rate?",
      "Other countries that have tried similar monetary incentives have had mixed success.",
      "Australia introduced a baby bonus in 2004, providing $3,000 Australian dollars to parents for each birth, an amount that was eventually hiked to A$5,000.",
      "After an initial bump in births when the policy was introduced, Australia's birth rate has continued to decline, dropping from about 2 children on average for each woman to about 1.5 in 2023, below the U.S. rate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Likewise, Hungary has introduced a number of incentives to convince its citizens to have more children, from providing baby grants to tax breaks for families with three or more children. Its birth rate increased slightly in the 2010s after hitting a record low of about 1.2 in 2011.",
      "But after rising to 1.6 in 2021, Hungary's birth rate is once again dropping, demographic data shows.",
      "\"Baby bonuses have not worked for Hungary. Why would we replicate this here in [the U.S.]?\" wrote Gabriella Hoffman, the director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at Independent Women's Forum, in a social media post.",
      "How much does it cost to raise a child?",
      "Raising a child in the U.S. doesn't come cheap, with one recent analysis finding parents will spend about $300,000 to raise a child to age 18.",
      "How would a U.S. baby bonus work?",
      "Typically such incentives are paid either through a tax credit or a government check, similar to the stimulus checks that were given to millions of households during the pandemic.",
      "Already, the U.S. has a Child Tax Credit of about $2,000 per child, but that is claimed on a parent's annual tax return, which means families must wait until tax season to collect the benefit.",
      "\"Unlike the Child Tax Credit, a baby bonus could come right after a child is born \u2014 there would be no wait until next year's tax season to get the money that parents need for a crib and a car seat today,\" wrote senior policy analyst Leah Sargeant in a recent post at the Niskanen Center, a political think tank. \"It can be more generously structured than the CTC because it is a supplement for a single, critical year, not an ongoing payment.\"",
      "How much would a $5,000 baby bonus cost the U.S.?",
      "If the parent of every child born in the U.S. annually qualified for a $5,000 bonus, the cost could mount to more than $15 billion a year.",
      "That could be tough to pass at a time when Republican lawmakers are seeking to reduce federal spending in order to pay for an extension of Mr. Trump's tax cuts, which is currently part of a bill advancing in Congress.",

      "Trade deals",
      "Over the last few weeks, the president and members of his administration have been meeting with different countries to discuss bi-lateral trade deals. This comes after Mr. Trump paused the implementation of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days \u2014 providing a sigh of relief to markets and consumers alike. This pause, UBS analysts said, demonstrates that the president is aware of how tariffs might be negatively impacting market activity.",
      "\"So, while we expect equity markets to remain choppy, the risk-reward for stocks is looking more appealing, especially now that we know that Trump is attuned to the risks from his tariff policies,\" said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management in a research note.",
      "Lefkowitz said that the tariff-induced slowdown will hinder corporate profit growth, but projected the economy would rebound next year as businesses and consumers acclimate to tariffs and the Fed introduces rate cuts.",
      "Tariffs on China could be slashed to as low as 50 to 65%, the Wall Street Journal this week\u00a0reported. But even if tariffs do come down as a result of trade negotiations, that doesn't mean the U.S. economy is out of the woods yet. The remaining levies could still stifle economic growth, analysts say.",

    "story": [
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg thinks the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs will be catastrophic for both his family-owned toy business and for the broader U.S. economy. That's why he's suing President Trump.",
      "Woldenberg's business has 500 employees and sells thousands of learning-based toys like Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog and the Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register. Its lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., accuses Mr. Trump and other members of his administration of overreaching the president's authority in imposing the broad-based import duties. Congress has historically held the power to authorize new tariffs or make trade deals with other nations.",
      "With the administration's higher tariffs in place, the math is dire for Learning Resources, Woldenberg said. The company's import duties are set to increase from $2.3 million prior to the Trump administration to $100 million \u2014 a roughly 4,000% increase, he said.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic\"",
      "At the same time, Woldenberg said he expects his company's sales to drop 25% this year as consumers scale back spending due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's trade war, the CEO had forecast an 8% increase in sales. Economists on Wall Street\u00a0say the tariffs\u00a0will slow U.S. economic growth while boosting inflation.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic,\" Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Forces have been unleashed in the economy \u2014 the world economy as well as the U.S. economy \u2014 that will have consequences that will be irreparable.\"",
      "Learning Resources' suit asks the court to find that Mr. Trump's tariffs are unlawful and to block the administration from collecting the levies. Based in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Learning Resources is a private, family-owned business founded in 1984.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the suit or the company's financial challenges caused by the tariffs.",
      "For now, Woldenberg said he's focused on figuring out how to shift manufacturing out of China, where about 60% of his products are produced. Goods imported from that nation are now facing U.S. tariffs of 145%.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by the companies that import the products, Woldenberg's business \u2014 not China \u2014 is on the hook for paying for Mr. Trump's high import duties.",
      "One question facing Woldenberg is whether he can shift production out of China fast enough to keep ahead of Mr. Trump's tariffs. In recent years, Learning Resources has added factories in India and Vietnam, but that effort has only moved the needle so far, he said.",
      "\"In a two- or three-year period we moved 16% of our product from China to those markets and got things going,\" Woldenberg said. \"That took a lot of effort, cost us a couple million dollars, at least, in out-of-pocket expenses to move it from Point A to Point B, and a huge amount of man hours on our side to essentially redevelop all those products.\"",
      "Despite that effort, however, the company has to date moved only about 16% of its manufacturing capacity out of China to other countries, Woldenberg said.",
      "Reshoring realities",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that tariffs will revive the domestic manufacturing sector because the costs of the import taxes will spur both American and foreign businesses to reshore their factories to the U.S. But economists \u2014 and Woldenberg \u2014 are skeptical, pointing out that such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories.",
      "\"The fact that [Mr. Trump] believes in it is something that I think is irrelevant \u2014 there are people that believe in ghosts, OK?\" Woldenberg said.",
      "Learning Resources' financial resources aren't deep enough to build its own factory, Woldenberg said. He noted that he's also tried to find plants in the U.S. that could make some of his products because he believed toys with a \"Made in USA\" label could appeal to some customers.",
      "\"If we had six to 10 products that were made in America, we could go and say, 'Look! Made in America. You want made in America? Here's Made in America,\" he said. \"We can't even find somebody to make six or 10 products.\"",
      "The reason, he said, is U.S. manufacturers don't have the capability to make the types of products he's selling, while the costs of manufacturing them himself would be prohibitive. \"I cannot produce a factory that can produce our product at a competitive price,\" Woldenberg said.",
      "To be sure, some businesses have announced plans to build new U.S. plants or hire more workers in recent months. They include tech giant Apple, which in February\u00a0said\u00a0that it's committed to spending more than $500 billion on expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities over four years.",
      "But Apple \"is in a different stratosphere than me,\" Woldenberg noted. \"They also have like a dozen products. We have 2,000.\"",
      "Skittish workers",
      "Meantime, Woldenberg said he's committed to keeping his 500 workers employed, likening the current challenges to those his business faced during the pandemic. Now, as then, his employees are worried about the impact of Mr. Trump's trade war and whether their jobs might be at risk, he said.",
      "\"Two days before we were kicked out of our office in March of 2020, I had an all-company meeting and I said, 'We define this as a community problem ... the goal is to get everybody across the river.' And we did that,\" he said. \"No one lost an hour of pay.\"",
      "Woldenberg added, \"I have a very strong commitment to getting them through this, and it's unwavering, and I'll do everything that I can.\"",
      "Even so, Woldenberg wants to see the Trump administration drop their tariff plans.",
      "\"They should go back to the way things were on January 19th and figure out another plan. This one is not working,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 15:19:05 -0400",
    "summary": "Avelo Airlines says it's counting on a new federal contract for deportation flights to help the discount carrier grow its regular passenger service.",
    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I still think it's morally questionable to run these charters for the federal government and think it poses a very real reputational risk for Avelo,\" Miller said, citing protests against the airline at some of Avelo's hubs.",
      "Will Humphries, a traveler at Sonoma County Airport, in Santa Rosa, California, where Avelo operates, is among those members of the flying public who plan to boycott Avelo because of its work with ICE.",
      "\"There's not much I can do as an individual, so the limited choices I can make, like switching an airline, is definitely within my ability,\" he told CBS News Bay Area.",

Between 80-120 restaurants will close before the year's end, while the remainder of the 200 will wind down operations based on franchise agreements, the company said. The plan will take place under a \"block closure program\" that is distinct from other planned restaurant closures, of up to 2% of existing stores.",

      "The company did not release a list of stores it plans to shutter in 2025, but said more details will be available in August.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0 Forty-five days into a U.S. air campaign against Iranian-backed Houthis, American forces have hit more than 1,000 targets in Yemen. Yet, despite promises from Trump administration officials to run \"the most transparent Defense Department in history,\" the Pentagon has held just one formal briefing in the first 100 days of President Trump's second term.",
      "\"In line with the secretary's vision to make this the most transparent Department of Defense in history, I gave you my personal commitment to make these briefings more routine,\" said top Pentagon public affairs aide Sean Parnell on March 17, during the only formal briefing conducted so far.",
      "During the same period, the White House and State Department have held 18 and 13 briefings, respectively, as of April 28.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Pentagon had 34 on-camera briefings in its first 100 days while Biden's White House and State Department held 61 and 34 briefings, respectively. During the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's first term, reporters received five on-camera briefings from the Defense Department.",
      "The Pentagon has a long history of briefing the media about military operations. Until his departure in 1968, Barry Zorthian would climb to the rooftop of Saigon's Rex Hotel to give reporters the Pentagon's official version of the Vietnam War. The briefings were branded the \"Five O'Clock Follies\" by skeptical reporters, but even so, the dialogue between spokesperson and journalist provided a critical stream of information about what the government was doing on behalf of American citizens.",
      "The tradition stretched across wars \u2014 from Desert Storm in 1991 to the 1999 Kosovo air campaign \u2014\u00a0 and even during the Biden administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Pentagon continued to brief the press regularly.",
      "Retired Rear Adm. T. McCreary, who ran the Navy's public affairs office as the chief of naval information from 2003 to 2006, told CBS News there are three reasons to hold news briefings: To get your story out first, so the public reacts to you; second, to stop the spread of the enemy putting out disinformation to spin the story; and third, to inform the taxpayers what the Pentagon, which has the largest discretionary budget of any department, is doing with its money.",
      "\"Every time the Pentagon and the [Defense Department] establishments start being less forthcoming with information, it erodes the trust and transparency that was built up over years to where the faith and the establishment sometimes starts getting questioned,\" McCreary said.",
      "The Office of the Secretary of Defense's Principles of Information details the Pentagon's guidelines for public affairs. Included is the promise to \"make available timely and accurate information so that the public, the Congress, and the news media may assess and understand the facts about national security and defense strategy.\"",
      "The single on-camera briefing the Pentagon held 43 days ago took place in the days after U.S. Central Command launched the ongoing campaign against the Houthis. Parnell, the chief spokesperson, and the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich answered questions on the operation.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has held news conferences and short question and answer sessions with a small group of reporters while traveling but has not yet conducted an on-camera briefing in the Pentagon Briefing Room, which accommodates about 60 reporters. He has, however, used the briefing room on at least four separate occasions as a backdrop for live interviews with Fox News.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. Central Command issued a press release boasting of hundreds of enemy fighters killed and dozens of command and storage centers destroyed under Operation Rough Rider. The targets, officials said, included advanced missiles, drones, and vessels used in Houthi attacks on commercial shipping lanes\u2014claims offered with little public scrutiny and even fewer questions answered as the total cost of the campaign nears $1 billion, CNN reported.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Pentagon and U.S. Central Command with questions on Monday, but neither one has responded.",
      "Soon after the campaign against the Houthis began, Hegseth was embroiled in controversy over sensitive details he shared over Signal on March 15 ahead of the initial strikes.",
      "Hegseth has denied sending any classified information, but over a month later, his use of Signal is still under scrutiny, following the revelation that he shared similar updates in a second chat that included his wife, brother and personal attorney.",
      "In that same month, five officials in Hegseth's inner circle have either been fired or left their positions, including John Ullyot, who briefly served as Pentagon Press Secretary and wrote an op-ed after his departure claiming there is \"total chaos\" at the Pentagon.",
      "Hegseth and Parnell, the chief spokesperson, have both denied these claims and have on social media blamed the stories on the media and disgruntled employees, but they have not briefed journalists to address questions.",
      "\"I think the administration would like to talk about something besides Signal, but the problem is they keep screwing it up,\" a former senior defense official told CBS News. \"You know the first thing about being in a bad news cycle is to stop creating news.\"",
      "During the Biden administration, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in the aftermath of his hospitalization scandal, took questions from the podium in the Pentagon press briefing room. For about 40 minutes, he answered questions and apologized for not disclosing his hospitalization and cancer diagnosis.",
      "\"It is hard to overstate the importance of having the Pentagon hold regular press briefings,\" said Howard Altman, president of the Military Reporters and Editors association in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"The American public has a right to know how and why taxpayer dollars are spent, how those in uniform are faring and, within the boundaries of operational security, the dangers our troops and nation face\u2026this is not a partisan issue,\" he said. \"It is an American one. A well-informed public is a cornerstone of our democracy.\"",
      "Parnell has been going to X to provide weekly situation reports \u2014 or sitreps \u2014 where he talks straight to the camera about Pentagon updates as part of the administration's promise of transparency. The videos released each week do not provide the opportunity for the media to ask questions.",
      "Instead of regular press engagements, the Pentagon in February created DOD Rapid Response, a social media account on X. The account's bio states it is \"Supporting The Mission of SecDef [Hegseth] And Fighting Against Fake News!\"",
      "The account commonly attacks news publications and\u00a0 posts comments criticizing reporting about Hegseth and the Defense Department. The X account has omitted context from its statements, touting an increase in U.S. military recruiting numbers between February 2024 through February 2025, even though much of the credit for improved recruitment numbers belongs to Biden administration, as CBS News' Confirmed team found.",
      "The account also posted misleading statements about the Signal chat scandal reported by The Atlantic. The account is overseen by conservative podcaster and Army veteran Graham Allen, who is now the Pentagon's digital media director.",
      "\"Holding your policies up to the light of media scrutiny is a good, healthy thing,\" a second former senior defense official said. \"Over time, that scrutiny is very good for the policymaking process because reporters are going to think of things, and they're going to approach the way to ask questions in ways that the policy thinkers and the policy makers may not have done.\"",

      "While Mr. Trump touts his economic record in interviews with the press, he has claimed without evidence that consumers are seeing record low prices at their gas pumps and exaggerated the decline in crude oil prices since he took office. The president has also falsely stated that he has overseen a drop in grocery prices.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's false claim that gas hit $1.98 a gallon in some places",
      "Trump said April 22: \"I see that we had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon. Nobody thought they'd see that for years maybe.\"",
      "Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that gas prices dropped to a low of $1.98 in a few states in April, hitting lows not seen since his first term. However, that is not true; on average, gas prices are around the same as when the president took office in January.",
      "Data from the Energy Information Administration shows a national average of about $3.14 per gallon of regular gas as of the third week in April \u2014 which is slightly higher than the $3.11 the week Mr. Trump was inaugurated.",
      "GasBuddy, a company that tracks prices at more than 150,000 gas stations across the country, told CBS News it had not found evidence of a gas station selling gas for $1.98 per gallon in April.",
      "Patrick De Haan, who leads petroleum analysis with the company, said the lowest price they could find in April was $2.19 at a gas station in Texas.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim that gas prices are at their lowest level since his first term is also not true; gas prices were lower than they are now for the first six months of Biden's presidency.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for more information on the president's claim.",
      "Trump's partially true claim that crude oil prices have dropped significantly since he took office",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"Energy is down and we're about $64 a barrel.\u00a0 When I came in\u2013 and we were looking at $89, $90, $95.\"",
      "The president also claimed crude oil prices dropped to about $64 a barrel, from around $89 when he took office.",
      "A White House spokesman said the president was referring to the price per barrel of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark. According to data from FactSet, Mr. Trump accurately described the current price of Brent crude, which was about $64 a barrel on April 28, but he also exaggerated the price at the time he assumed office, which was about $80. The White House did not explain the discrepancy.",
      "According to a recent Energy Information Administration report, Mr. Trump's tariff hikes in early April contributed to declines in oil prices as traders weighed the potential impact on global demand. An early April announcement that OPEC members would increase oil production ahead of schedule also added to the downward pressure on prices.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that the price of groceries came down since he took office",
      "Trump said April 24: \"Groceries are down.\" Trump said April 17: \"Food is down. Groceries, as we call it, are down.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that grocery prices have declined since he took office. However, Consumer Price Index data shows average cost of groceries in March increased by 0.49% from the previous month and by 2.4% compared to the previous year.",
      "Prices vary across products, and the White House said the president was referring to declines in the consumer prices of certain grocery store items like fresh vegetables. The USDA's Food Price Outlook shows that fresh vegetable prices decreased 1.1% in March, after falling by 1.7% in February. However, the same report also shows the prices of beef, poultry, eggs, and nonalcoholic beverages all ticked up in March.",
      "These increases occurred before the president imposed a baseline 10% tariff on goods from most countries in early April as well as tariffs as high as 145% on imports from China. Economists expect the prices of some grocery store items, including coffee and chocolate, will rise as a result, which could be reflected when data for April is released in the coming weeks.",
      "Trump's false claim that egg prices have gone down 87%",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House, thousands and thousands of eggs, and the price was down 87% so we did a great job.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that egg prices are down significantly, without clarifying whether he is referring to wholesale or consumer prices. The president has a point that wholesale prices have declined since he took office, but he overstates the size of the decline. And recent data suggests consumer prices remain elevated.",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 what large buyers such as Costco or Walmart pay producers \u2014 have dropped sharply since mid-March as egg losses due to bird flu decreased last month. U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows wholesale egg prices were roughly 52% lower on April 25 than they were at the start of Mr. Trump's second term. The White House did not explain the discrepancy in the president's figures.",
      "Meanwhile, retail prices for consumers remain at record highs. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released on April 10 shows average retail egg prices hit $6.23 per dozen in March, surpassing the previous record $5.90 set in February.",
      "A March 28 report from the Department of Agriculture said it can take \"up to three weeks\" for consumers to benefit from the wholesale price decline. If retail prices show consistent decline, this should be reflected in the national average from BLS for April, said Jeremy Horpedahl, an associate professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas. That data should become available on May 13.",

    "summary": "A ruling by the Supreme Court in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would lead to the country's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday is set to hear arguments in a high-profile dispute over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "A decision follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions. But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing. \"",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Just eight justices will hear arguments in the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett has recused herself. Though she did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",
      "Because of Barrett's recusal, the Supreme Court could deadlock 4-4. That result would leave in place the ruling from the Oklahoma Supreme Court that found the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic public charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "A decision is expected by the end of June or early July.",

    "story": [
      "When the Justice Department first notified reporters of an 8:15 a.m. press conference at a nondescript federal office complex in Manassas, Virginia, last month, the agency wouldn't reveal why, instead alluding to a major pending announcement.",
      "But the agency did release information about the topic in advance to the Fox News Channel, which prepared coverage and aired a live feed of Attorney General Pam Bondi announcing the arrest of a man she called the \"East Coast leader\" of the transnational MS-13 gang. Exclusive images of the bust were prominently displayed on Fox's morning program.",
      "The press conference was an early test of the Trump administration's emerging media strategy, targeting the 8 a.m. hour of a cable news program frequently watched by MAGA loyalists and their boss: President Trump.",
      "The announcement of the arrest of the alleged MS-13 kingpin\u00a0 offered a colorful media moment for Bondi and the newly-installed FBI Director Kash Patel. Outfitted in an FBI windbreaker and cap, Patel began his remarks by touting\u00a0the arrest as the work of an agency that allows \"good cops to be good cops.\"",
      "Bondi, Patel and Virginia Gov. Glenn Younkin, who joined the March 27 news conference, didn't reveal the name of the man arrested during the press event, but the announcement nevertheless yielded local and national news coverage through the day and night, including a segment on \"Fox and Friends\" that the agency would also share on social media.",
      "A month later, the Justice Department is seeking to drop the criminal case against the man, Henrry Villatoro Santos, to instead expedite his deportation. The department has never publicly revealed any alleged connection to violent MS-13 crimes.",
      "One former agency official told CBS News the media strategy for some Trump administration initiatives revolves around unveiling and defending the move while Mr. Trump is watching television.",
      "\"Often, there's an audience of one. No other press really matters,\" the official said.",
      "That theory is supported by Mr. Trump's remarks Monday at a Rose Garden celebration of the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles. During his remarks, the president looked in the direction of Bondi and said, \"Good job on television this morning, Pam.\"\u00a0 Bondi had appeared during the 8 a.m. hour on \"Fox and Friends\" earlier that day.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth adopted a similar approach\u00a0 after a second wave of controversy over his use of the Signal messaging app last week. Hegseth defended his performance and sought to defuse the controversy during an exclusive interview in the 8 a.m. hour on \"Fox and Friends.\"",
      "Days earlier, the Justice Department announced a civil lawsuit against the state of Maine over its policies on transgender athletes during a news conference in the 8 a.m. hour. Frequent Fox News Channel guests, of which Bondi is one, were featured prominently at the event held in the Justice Department's 7th-floor press room, along with former Olympic athlete Riley Gaines. The news conference was lengthy and included declarative statements of praise for Mr. Trump.",
      "The White House followed a similar rhythm this week as it marks the milestone of 100 days in office and navigates sinking poll numbers for Mr. Trump.\u00a0 White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and \"border czar\" Tom Homan answered questions in the 8 a.m. hour on Monday, and made the case that the president has secured a series of accomplishments on border issues. Leavitt also shared mugshot-style photos of alleged undocumented criminals that were posted on the White House North Lawn.",
      "Frank Sesno, a former CNN anchor who is now executive director of the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs, said the administration's strategy is leveraging a potent hour of the day to drive a political message.",
      "\"It's fresh for morning television. It sets the agenda for the rest of the day. It can drive the conversation on talk radio and the blogosphere and elsewhere,\" Sesno told CBS News.",
      "Sesno said the administration's focus on the Fox News Channel's audience is no surprise.",
      "\"The White House is jumping on the Fox News cycle to hit the Fox audience, which is the largest cable news audience out there,\" he said. \"It's not the least bit surprising they're doing so, since the administration basically hired half of Fox News to come populate their Cabinet.\"",
      "Leavitt declined to answer specific questions about the evolving media strategy, instead issuing a statement to CBS News, saying, \"We are flattered that CBS is asking the Trump White House how to make good TV. Clearly they need the advice!\"",
      "One former official who worked in both Trump administrations noted how the 8:15 a.m. news conferences can yield a live audience without the editing, filtering and journalistic review of news by editors.",
      "The arrest of Villatoro-Santos, for example, reached an audience of millions without the Department of Justice ever revealing the specific accusations in his case. The Justice Department will ask a judge to dismiss his case tomorrow in federal court in Virginia.",

      "\"Yesterday I played 18 holes. I'm going to play 18 holes in my league today, and if I feel okay, I'll play 18 holes tomorrow,\" said Richards recently.",
      "The former professional tennis player and ophthalmologist made headlines in the 1970s, when after transitioning to female she sued and won the right to play in the U.S. Open. During her half-decade pro career, Richards peaked at 20th in the world and in 1977 made the U.S. open finals in doubles, where she lost to a pair that included tennis legend Martina Navratilova.",
      "Half a century later, her views have evolved \u2014 she believes transgender women who transition after puberty should not compete in women's sports \u2014 but she's aghast at broader restrictions on transgender rights during the Trump administration's first 100 days.",
      "The State Department has halted the practice of issuing passports with \"X\" gender markers. The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip \"gender ideology\" from websites, contracts and emails. An executive order calls on the federal government \"to rescind all funds from educational programs\" that allow transgender girls and women to compete. Another order restricts access to gender-affirming care\u00a0for youth. The Department of Defense has reinstated President Trump's first term transgender military ban, and transgender federal inmates are now regarded by their sex at birth. The changes are the subject of ongoing lawsuits.",
      "First and foremost on Richards' mind: the Navy veteran believes transgender Americans should be able to serve openly in the military.",
      "\"That's terrible. You know, I can only think of myself because I was in the Navy when nobody knew that I was a transgender. I hadn't had surgery yet, but it was still me,\" said Richards, who won the All-Navy tennis championship while serving. \"That goes a long way back, but I'm still representative of the same ilk even though they didn't know it at the time.\"",
      "Richards is the subject of a forthcoming book, tentatively titled \"Finding Ren\u00e9e,\" by former Sports Illustrated editor Julie Kliegman. Richards believes the fierce debate over transgender athletes has fueled a \"jump\u2026from the sports to the military, to the education, to the bathrooms, to the passports, to the existence, to the teaching of any kind of gender.\"",
      "It's a trend that has played out in state legislatures, before and during the current Trump administration, according to Logan Casey, the director of policy research at the nonprofit Movement Advancement Project, which tracks state laws and executive orders regulating gender.",
      "Casey said state-level bans on sports prior to the current Trump administration \"laid the groundwork for all of the anti-transgender and anti-LGBTQ attacks more broadly.\"",
      "\"It sort of put sports as a foot in the door, and a framework, for how many people who had not previously thought about transgender people very much \u2014 let alone in the context of policy and law \u2014 are now thinking about it and framing it,\" said Casey, who noted the vast majority of state legislation targeting LGBTQ rights fails to become law.",
      "Ash Lazarus Orr, a spokesperson for Advocates for Trans Equality, said the language of Mr. Trump's executive orders bore similarities to orders and legislation coming out of state capitals.",
      "\"It signals back to states that, yes, this is a priority. You should continue to do this, and in fact do this and other attacks,\" said Orr, who is also the title plaintiff in a lawsuit over the Trump administration's policy requiring U.S. passports to reflect sex assigned at birth. \"While we were seeing attacks on the trans community escalating at a state level under the Biden administration, what we are seeing now under the Trump administration is absolutely an escalation.\"",
      "Former Olympic swimmer Nancy Hogshead, a Democrat who founded the nonprofit advocacy group Champion Women, believes the party is suffering from self-inflicted wounds.",
      "Hogshead, who supports efforts to align participation in sports with gender at birth, said Trump and Republicans have found a galvanizing issue.",
      "\"It is a winner for them. It is a winner for Republicans,\" Hogshead said. \"Fifty percent of all girls play sports. That is a meat and potatoes issue for them. It's not a fringe issue.\"",
      "Richards believes Trump has a similar view. She said, as an ophthalmologist, she treated one of his sisters and has met Mr. Trump once.",
      "\"He knows I'm not an ogre,\" she said. \"He sees, and his advisors advise him, that his popularity rests with the small group of people that hate the idea of transgender, period.\"",
      "Richards, whose professional tennis career began in 1977 when she was more than 40 years old, largely agrees with Hogshead. In April 2024, she provided the Women's Tennis Association with a position paper on participation of transgender women in sports, and this year allowed Sports Illustrated to publish it. In the paper, Richards concluded that people who have undergone male puberty should be ineligible to compete against biological females.",
      "Richards's paper included reflections on her time playing both as an amateur and professionally, analysis of \"the current literature on the subject,\" citing her decades as a doctor, and policy recommendations.",
      "It also touched on golf.",
      "\"My lifetime in sports is still ongoing,\" she wrote. \"I have been a member of the ladies' golf league at the public/private club near my home for the past 20 years.\"",
      "Richards spoke to CBS News on opening day last week. She said, despite politics, the women in her league still welcome her competition.",
      "\"Not only welcome and accepted, but if I didn't show up, they would have a cemetery ceremony, believe me,\" Richards said.",
      "Are there a lot of 90-year-olds there, still hitting the links?",
      "\"Yeah, me. Amongst the men and the women, I'm the only one,\" Richards said, adding that she guesses the average age at the club is 60. \"I play the forward tee, but I don't play any gold tees that are in front of that \u2014 and I hit the ball as well as they do, too.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-100-days-campaign-promises/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:59:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Most of the progress President Trump has made on his promises were achieved through executive orders.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 In the four years between his two terms, President Trump had a lot of time to consider what he could do differently if he won the presidency again. In the first 100 days of his second term, he's been able to deliver on some of the promises he repeated most during his campaign, while others remain out of reach.",
      "But much like the first 100 days of his first term, most of the progress Mr. Trump has made on his promises were achieved through executive orders.",
      "Here's a look at some of his 2024 campaign promises and their status after 100 days:",
      "The promise: End Russia-Ukraine war",
      "Mr. Trump has yet to negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, a conflict he boasted would be settled before he even took office. He said more than once he would bring the war to a close within \"24 hours\" of his second term.",
      "Despite U.S. pressure on Ukraine and to a lesser extent, Russia, there is no peace yet, or even a temporary ceasefire. The administration is now threatening to walk from negotiations with Russia and Ukraine, as Russia\u00a0continues its attacks.",
      "The promise: Pardon Jan. 6 rioters",
      "This was one of the first promises Mr. Trump delivered on upon taking office. Hours after he was sworn in, he granted clemency to about 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Among those who received clemency are people who were convicted of violent and serious crimes, including assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Mr. Trump also ordered the Justice Department to end all pending cases connected to the riot, abruptly ending the department's massive effort under former President Joe Biden to hold those who participated in the attack accountable.",
      "The promise: \"Save\" TikTok",
      "Before taking office, Mr. Trump promised to \"save\" the short-form video app used by 170 million Americans. In 2024, Congress passed a law that required TikTok to divest from its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, or be cut off from U.S. app-hosting stores. Despite lengthy legal wrangling, when ByteDance failed to cut ties with TikTok by Jan. 19, the deadline set by Congress, the app was effectively banned in the U.S.",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that directed the Justice Department not to enforce the law for 75 days and TikTok later reappeared in app stores. The president on April 4 again delayed enforcement of the law for another 75 days as a sale remained elusive.",
      "The promise: Make IVF free",
      "In August, Mr. Trump told voters that the government or insurance companies \"will be mandated to pay for all costs associated with IVF treatment.\" He did not elaborate how he would enact it.",
      "That has not yet come to fruition, though the president directed his administration to find ways to reduce the high costs of IVF for Americans struggling with fertility. The Feb. 18 order requested policy recommendations within 90 days.",
      "The promise: Release JFK assassination records",
      "The Trump administration released about 80,000 government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy in mid-March. The documents had been released before, but sections were redacted for national security purposes. Many of those portions were made public with the new release.",
      "The declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination. Some documents are available in person at the National Archives, but others are still being uploaded. Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. There are also IRS-related documents that must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "The promise: Close the Education Department",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order last month to begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education \"once and for all.\" The Education Department's workforce has already been cut in half, and there are plans to transfer some of its functions to other agencies. Still, fully eliminating the department would require an act of Congress.",
      "The promise: Carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history",
      "\"On Day One, I will launch the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America,\" Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail.",
      "The Trump administration has aggressively pursued deportations, perhaps most notably by invoking an 18th century law known as the Alien Enemies Act that has only been used during wartime to immediately deport some migrants accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "The president's attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act for this purpose is being litigated in the courts.",
      "The promise: \"Tariff the hell\" out of countries that have taken \"advantage\" of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump vowed to \"tariff the hell\" out of countries that he believes haven't treated the U.S. fairly on trade. He followed through on that threat for just under a week, imposing heavy tariffs on most countries based on their trade deficits with the U.S. He blinked in the face of a bond market sell-off, suspending most of the tariffs for 90 days while he and top administration officials try to negotiate trade deals with individual nations. He still kept in place tariffs adding up to 145% against China.",
      "The promise: Withdraw from the Paris climate accords",
      "Just like he did in his first term, one of Mr. Trump's first moves when he took office in January was to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, after former President Joe Biden rejoined the agreement. Countries who have signed onto the Paris accord agree to specific efforts meant to help curb climate change.",
      "The promise: Make expiring tax cuts permanent",
      "Congress is working to make the income tax cuts enacted in Mr. Trump's first term permanent. It's not something the president can do on his own. Key provisions of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "The promise: Eliminate taxes on tips",
      "One of Mr. Trump's repeated campaign promises was eliminating federal income taxes on tips, something he found was popular with his working-class base. Republicans on the House Budget Committee estimate eliminating income taxes on tips would cost more than $100 billion over a decade.",
      "But eliminating taxes on tips would require an act of Congress, and it's not yet clear whether it will be included in the budget reconciliation package.",
      "The promise: Eliminate taxes on seniors' Social Security income",
      "Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security income is also something Mr. Trump has pledged to do. This, too, will take an act of Congress. And Congress hasn't made serious moves toward that end. Some economists warn that eliminating taxes on Social Security would create an even larger federal deficit.",
      "The promise: Stop funding for schools with vaccine and mask mandates",
      "Mr. Trump pledged during the campaign that he \"would not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate.\" He issued an executive order in February that prohibits schools and colleges with COVID-19 vaccine mandates from receiving federal money, though no states currently have such a requirement. It only applies to the COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "The promise: End birthright citizenship",
      "The president's executive order on birthright citizenship, which has long been interpreted as guaranteed under the 14th Amendment, was one of the first that he signed after he was sworn in. The order denied birthright citizenship to children born after Feb. 19 to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident.",
      "Mr. Trump's mandate has been blocked by federal courts in several states as being unconstitutional. The Supreme Court\u00a0will hear arguments in May on a Trump administration request to partially enforce the order.",
      "The promise: Cut federal funding to schools that teach \"critical race theory\" and \"transgender\" matters",
      "In January, Mr. Trump ordered schools to stop teaching what he views as \"critical race theory\" and other material related to race and sexuality. The executive order declared that K-12 schools could not use federal money on the \"indoctrination\" of children, including \"radical gender ideology and critical race theory.\"",
      "He signed a separate executive order in February to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity. The order mandates that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. Those not in compliance jeopardize any federal funding they receive, Mr. Trump said.",

    "title": "100 days of DOGE: Elon Musk's sweeping Trump administration role",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/100-days-of-doge-elon-musk-trump/",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:11:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Elon Musk and DOGE amassed vast power in President Trump's administration \u2014 reshaping federal agencies and spearheading deep cuts to the federal workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Since President Trump returned to office 100 days ago, Elon Musk has amassed vast power \u2014 leading the administration's efforts to shutter government agencies and slash the federal workforce.",
      "Musk's ruthless approach to leading the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 epitomized by a speech in which the Tesla CEO brandished a chainsaw \u2014 has drawn lawsuits, pushback from federal workers and criticism from Tesla investors. But he's also held onto broad support from Republican voters and, at least publicly, from Mr. Trump himself.",
      "Musk gained influence \u2014 and spent heavily \u2014 in 2024 race",
      "Musk \u2014 the world's richest person \u2014 endorsed Mr. Trump minutes after the then-presidential candidate's July 2024 assassination attempt. Musk had oscillated on backing Mr. Trump: The one-time Obama backer suggested Mr. Trump \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset\" in 2022, and later supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's 2024 GOP primary bid.",
      "The alliance between the two billionaires was defined by campaign cash. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Mr. Trump and other GOP candidates in 2024, much of it through Musk's America PAC. The group helped lead Mr. Trump's get-out-the-vote efforts, and became known for using its massive war chest in unorthodox and often controversial ways. One plan to dole out $1 million a day to swing state voters who signed a petition drew a lawsuit from Philadelphia's district attorney, who accused Musk's super PAC of running an illegal lottery.",
      "Mr. Trump floated a Musk-led \"government efficiency commission\" during the later months of the campaign. The scope of Musk's role was initially unclear: In a post-election statement, Mr. Trump framed DOGE as an external body that would offer \"advice and guidance,\" a far more limited role than the one Musk took on.",
      "Musk promises $2 trillion in cuts but slashes far less",
      "In an October campaign rally, the billionaire predicted he could find at least $2 trillion in annual savings, which would require him to slash the budget by nearly 30% \u2014 a daunting goal considering that almost half of all government spending goes toward the military, Medicare and Social Security, three politically difficult-to-cut areas. Earlier this year, Musk cited a still-ambitious $1 trillion as his target.",
      "So far, DOGE's stated cost savings haven't come close to the trillion-dollar mark. Musk said earlier this month he anticipates $150 billion in savings in the 2026 fiscal year by cutting waste and fraud. Meanwhile, the DOGE website says it has saved $160 billion through a combination of cancelling contracts and grants, selling assets and ferreting out fraud.",
      "But many of the cost savings touted by DOGE have been called into question. DOGE keeps a running tally of spending cuts on its website, but this \"wall of receipts\" has included errors and unverified claims, including an $8 million cancelled contract that was erroneously listed at $8 billion, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields defended DOGE's cost-cutting goals and called $1 trillion a year an achievable benchmark. He also said mistakes are rare and \"corrected immediately,\" and the statistics on DOGE's site go through a \"lengthy assessment and analysis.\" The $8 billion mistake dates back to the prior administration, DOGE has argued.",
      "\"The goal is to cut as much waste, fraud and abuse from the federal government as possible,\" Fields told CBS News. \"The president is very happy and supportive of the achievements of DOGE, and knows that we are just now getting started.\"",
      "Some of Musk's claims about the size of the government's fraud problem are also difficult to prove. He told Fox Business' Larry Kudlow last month the government could save $500 billion to $700 billion by cutting fraud and waste from entitlement programs, but there's little evidence that fraud exists on anywhere near that scale, which would equal 20% to 30% of all annual spending on Social Security and Medicare. The Government Accountability Office estimates the government loses $233 billion to $521 billion per year due to fraud. When asked about Musk's $700 billion fraud estimates, Fields said \"I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility.\"",
      "And DOGE's efforts to slash the federal workforce could end up costing $135 billion due to paid leave and productivity costs, an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service estimates.",
      "That estimate was dismissed by the White House. \"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" Fields told CBS News last week.",
      "Thousands of federal workers cut since Trump and Musk's \"fork in the road\"",
      "When the Trump administration emailed millions of federal workers in January to offer months of pay in exchange for quitting their jobs, the message's subject line \u2014 \"Fork in the Road\" \u2014 was identical to the one Musk used to coax staff into leaving Twitter after he bought the site.",
      "Since then, Musk has played a central role in efforts to cut up to 10% of the civilian workforce.",
      "The White House says 75,000 people took the \"Fork in the Road\" deferred resignation deal, which offered to pay employees until the end of September if they resigned from their positions by early February. As many as 200,000 workers were expected to participate. Tens of thousands of federal employees have also been laid off, including large numbers of probationary workers with less than one or two years of service.",
      "The job cuts have hit across the federal government. DOGE staffers visited the Pentagon in February as the military plans to eliminate tens of thousands of civilian roles. The Social Security Administration has lost thousands of workers, and the Internal Revenue Service could cut its staff by 25% according to the Associated Press.",
      "Health agencies have been hit by the administration's cuts. The National Institutes of Health is expected to face steep budget cuts, a move former NIH Director Francis Collins warned could have dire consequences for public health in an interview with \"60 Minutes.\" The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has lost 10% of its staff, CBS News reported.",
      "Some 1,000 National Park Service workers were laid off, raising fears about understaffing.",
      "Fields told CBS News the Trump administration's job cuts are designed to avoid any disruption to critical government services, but added: \"To a bureaucracy that has gone untouched for decades, it's going to be disruptive.\"",
      "In some cases, laid-off probationary workers have been rehired due to now-paused court orders that halted the job cuts, causing confusion. \"We're supposed to be OK. But one minute we're in a good space, and the next minute we could just lose everything,\" one rehired Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services staff member told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, Musk has publicly blasted the federal workforce, claiming DOGE is on a mission to eliminate a \"dictatorship of the bureaucracy\" that's hostile to Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "In February, federal employees received an email with the subject line, \"What did you do last week?\" instructing them to reply with a list of five things they'd accomplished. Musk warned on X that any non-responses \"will be taken as a resignation.\" The move set off confusion, with some agencies telling workers not to respond. Musk later called the emails a \"pulse check\" designed to root out dead or nonexistent people that he claims are collecting paychecks.",
      "DOGE tries to shut down agencies: USAID, CFPB and more",
      "Even if DOGE's cuts could fall short of Musk's goals, its influence has been sweeping.",
      "Within days of Mr. Trump's inauguration, DOGE began touting cancelled contracts, and its staff became embedded in scores of departments. Musk told Fox Business last month his team of over 100 people was in \"pretty much\" every agency. Many of the funding cuts have been abrupt, and Musk has admitted DOGE has made mistakes in its rapid push to slash spending.",
      "In some cases, Musk's team has participated in the near-dismantling of federal agencies. The gambit has often begun with DOGE staffers accessing an agency's offices \u2014 in some cases clashing with employees \u2014 followed by mass job cuts.",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development, a foreign aid agency that Musk described as a \"criminal organization\" awash with fraud, was one of his earliest targets. Two USAID security officials were put on leave for trying to stop DOGE staffers from accessing internal systems (a Trump administration spokesperson said at the time classified information wasn't accessed without security clearances). The Trump administration later placed many of USAID's staff on leave, halted foreign aid programs and began absorbing what remained of USAID into the State Department.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also drawn Musk's ire. In early February, DOGE personnel entered the financial regulator's office and \"camped out in the basement,\" a former agency staffer told CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" Hours later, Musk posted on X, \"CFPB RIP.\" The administration has tried to lay off 90% of CFPB staff and halt the agency's work, though a federal judge has temporarily blocked those moves.",
      "DOGE's efforts at the U.S. Institute of Peace triggered a legal standoff, with several fired board members suing the administration and accusing DOGE personnel of engaging in a \"literal trespass and takeover by force\" at the agency's headquarters. The White House defended cuts to the organization at the time, telling CBS News, \"Taxpayers don't want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-funded 'research institute' that has failed to deliver peace.\"",
      "Musk accesses federal data",
      "Personnel at DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's internal payment system in the first few weeks of Mr. Trump's term, which Musk cast as a way to catch fraud. The move prompted concern from Democrats due to the sensitive personal data handled by the system and the possibility that DOGE could try to cut off spending authorized by Congress. The Trump administration said at the time Musk's team has \"read-only\" access.",
      "In mid-February, a staffer linked to DOGE also sought access to the Internal Revenue Service's taxpayer data system, drawing criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said the administration is planning a \"basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits.\"",
      "Musk has scrutinized the Social Security Administration, which he claims is rife with fraud, suggesting tens of millions of dead people are receiving payments and immigrants are abusing the system en masse, though he's never offered any evidence for either of these assertions. He's described Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme,\" though both Musk and Mr. Trump have said they would not cut benefits. At one point earlier this year, the SSA considered requiring Social Security recipients to verify their identities in person instead of over the phone, but the agency reversed course after seniors and their advocates objected.",
      "Musk clashes with Democrats, courts \u2014 and even Trump allies",
      "Musk's rise to power has drawn outrage from Democrats, who argue DOGE has unilaterally slashed spending appropriated by Congress. Most Republican lawmakers defended DOGE, though some have raised concerns about sweeping cuts to public health agencies and programs important to their districts.",
      "Public opinion on Musk is similarly divided. Some 52% of Americans said in late February Musk and DOGE had too much influence over federal worker firing decisions, including 81% of Democrats and 57% of independents but just 21% of Republicans, according to a CBS News poll with a margin of error of 2.5 points.",
      "Musk has occasionally clashed with other Trump loyalists. His pick for interim IRS leader \u2014 Hunter Biden whistleblower Gary Shapley \u2014 left the role after just 48 hours, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent privately complained to Mr. Trump. And Musk publicly feuded with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro over tariffs, calling him \"dumber than a sack of bricks.\"",
      "DOGE's aggressive moves have also drawn lawsuits arguing the agency has exceeded its authority. At various points, judges have halted DOGE's efforts to lay off workers and access the Treasury payment system, though in many cases, those rulings were stayed.",
      "Some legal challenges have zeroed in on Musk's official status in the administration. The White House says Musk is a \"special government employee,\" which allows him to serve for up to 130 days in a single yearlong period. The administration has argued in court papers that Musk isn't officially DOGE's administrator and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "DOGE clashes with Musk's business interests",
      "Musk's business empire benefits heavily from federal programs. Tesla sells billions of dollars a year in credits to automakers that fall short of federal emission rules, and its cars are subsidized by tax incentives for electric vehicles \u2014 though Mr. Trump has called for a rollback of electric car subsidies. Mr. Trump has also offered his public endorsement, promising to buy a Tesla in a White House event. Musk's aerospace company SpaceX has valuable contracts with NASA, and its satellite internet division Starlink could take over a contract to modernize the air traffic control system, the Associated Press reports.",
      "Musk has pushed back on conflict-of-interest concerns, saying in an Oval Office appearance with Mr. Trump, \"all of our actions are maximally transparent.\"",
      "But DOGE has caused agita for Tesla investors, some of whom fear Musk is too distracted to run the company or his polarizing image could hurt the carmaker's brand. The company's sales and profits have fallen over the past year, and its share price is down nearly 25% from early January, prompting some investors to urge him to step back from the Trump administration.",
      "Musk said on a Tesla earnings call last week his \"time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly\" in May. But he added that he'll remain involved for the rest of Mr. Trump's term.",
      "There's no indication DOGE or Musk's work at the White House will end next month. \"Elon Musk will still be a common face here,\" Fields said.",

    "summary": "As President Trump marks his first 100 days in the White House, many of the plans he has rolled out since the start of his second term closely align with those detailed in Project 2025's sprawling policy book.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, saying he had \"nothing to do with\" the initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, had not read it and didn't have any plans to.",
      "But as the president marks 100 days in the White House, many of the plans he has rolled out since the start of his second term closely align with those in the pages of Project 2025's sprawling, 900-page policy blueprint, which lays out an overhaul of the executive branch.",
      "Overseen by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was an initiative that was designed to provide a roadmap for the next Republican president, now Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, the president called some of its proposals \"abysmal\" and said he knew nothing about it, though CBS News' analysis showed many of its proposals were similar to his own.",
      "The authors of some of the policy guide's chapters served in his first administration and have returned for the second. Russ Vought is leading the Office of Management and Budget, and John Ratcliffe is in place as CIA director, while Peter Navarro, who was a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump in his first administration, returned for a second stint in the White House.",
      "Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances, Mr. Trump has taken new executive actions that echo policies outlined in Project 2025's policy book.",
      "Abolishing the Department of Education",
      "Republicans have long called for the Department of Education to be dismantled, and that recommendation was also made in Project 2025, which declared that \"federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Department of Education should be eliminated.\"",
      "Mr. Trump took steps to begin that process with an executive order he signed in March. The administration has already cut the Education Department's staff and is making plans to move some of its functions to other agencies.",
      "Shuttering the Department of Education, however, would require an act of Congress.",
      "Ending diversity, equity and inclusion practices",
      "The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and he signed an executive order on the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government.",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex.",
      "Project 2025 likewise calls for the \"DEI apparatus\" at a variety of agencies to be dismantled.",
      "Project 2025's policy book also calls for deleting a variety of terms, including DEI, abortion and gender equality \"from every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\"",
      "Some of the Trump administration's early efforts to purge mentions of gender or race resulted in missteps that prompted a public outcry and were later reversed.",
      "Shifting FEMA costs to the states",
      "Shortly after the start of his second term, Mr. Trump established a review council to advise him on the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, \"to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States.\" The council will also advise the president on recommended changes related to FEMA, his order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive came after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states.",
      "\"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" he said in late January.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that declares it is the policy of the U.S. that \"state and local governments and individuals play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness,\" and says that his administration will \"enable state and local governments to better understand, plan for and ultimately address the needs of their citizens.\"",
      "The overhaul at FEMA has sparked concerns about the agency's capabilities to deliver disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. FEMA has already denied requests for federal aid in response to severe storms and tornadoes\u00a0in Arkansas, flooding in parts of\u00a0West Virginia and storms\u00a0in Washington.",
      "Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities.",
      "\"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states.",
      "Targeting PBS and National Public Radio",
      "Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, informed the heads of National Public Radio and PBS in a letter earlier this year that the agency had opened an investigation into the airing of their programming across their roughly 1,500 broadcast member stations, according to The New York Times.",
      "Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from airing commercial advertisements.",
      "In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\"",
      "Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\" PBS CEO Paula Kerger said the cuts \"would devastate PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations.\"",
      "Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC, but another portion of the blueprint urges Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to NPR and PBS.",
      "According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book.",
      "Freezing federal assistance",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the White House's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 DOGE \u2014 run by Elon Musk, to slash regulations and spending, and restructure federal agencies.",
      "On the heels of that move, the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo in January that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs covered by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\"",
      "The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children, medical research and other priorities approved by Congress would be impacted by the order.",
      "The White House then rescinded the memo but maintained the funding pause \"to end any confusion\" created by a federal court order temporarily pausing implementation of the freeze. Federal courts have since ordered the administration to reinstate any money that was frozen subject to the memo.",
      "Vought, the head of OMB, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead.",
      "In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\"",
      "The memo may have been aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation.",
      "In Project 2025's policy blueprint, Vought also wrote the director of OMB must have \"sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making,\" and can achieve this by ensuring political appointees on his staff sign off on apportionments of funding authorized by Congress.",
      "Vought cited a 1870 law known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance and requires funding be doled out in installments.",
      "\"This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars,\" he wrote. \"OMB can then direct on behalf of a president the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the president's agenda and applicable laws.\"",
      "Restricting gender-affirming care for minors",
      "Mr. Trump issued an executive order in January that seeks to bar the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care \u2014 puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures \u2014 for people under the age of 19.",
      "Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs certain executive agencies to take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\"",
      "It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs.",
      "Mr. Trump's order directs the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw March 2022 guidance on gender-affirming care.",
      "Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document.",
      "The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it.",
      "Many families and doctors who care for transgender youth dispute that assessment, and a group of families filed a lawsuit claiming the order is discriminatory. Two different federal district courts have blocked the president's directive, and those injunctions are being appealed.",
      "Revoking security clearances",
      "Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process of revoking the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign. He also announced he would revoke the security clearances of a number of prominent Democrats including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton.",
      "Project 2025 also proposed stripping former intelligence officials of security clearances, under a more narrow set of circumstances, in a section on the intelligence community authored by Dustin Carmack, who worked at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "\"The president should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director,\" he wrote.",
      "Stripping civil servants of employment protections",
      "Among the slew of actions Mr. Trump took on his first day back in the White House was to reinstate an executive order issued during his first term that created \"Schedule F in the Excepted Service.\" The order creates a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of employment protections.",
      "The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\"",
      "\"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads.",
      "The order makes some minor changes to the president's prior measure from October 2020. But it notably adds a section that states that while employees in these new \"Schedule Policy/Career Positions,\" are not required to personally or politically support the current president or his policies, they are \"required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the president.\"",
      "Failure to do so is grounds for termination of employment, Mr. Trump's executive order states. Critics say the change would enable the administration to fire government employees for no cause and replace them with Trump loyalists.",
      "Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated.",
      "Reinstating service members who refused COVID-19 vaccines",
      "The president directed the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security to reinstate service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. (The vaccine requirement was lifted in 2023.) His order also states they should be reverted to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments or compensation.",
      "The Project 2025 blueprint's section on the Defense Department, authored by Chris Miller, calls for the next administration to \"reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\"",
      "Miller served as acting defense secretary in the final weeks of Mr. Trump's first term. His chief of staff, Kash Patel, is now serving as director of the FBI.",
      "Banning transgender people from the military",
      "During his first four years in the White House, Mr. Trump prohibited transgender people from serving in the military. President Biden repealed that ban, but Mr. Trump has issued an order that effectively bars transgender people from serving in the armed forces and withdraws his predecessor's order.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\" Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\"",
      "Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service.\"",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit group comprising thousands of transgender service members, veterans and their supporters, disputed such claims, saying: \"Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve.\"",
      "The transgender military ban has since been blocked by two different federal courts, though the decisions have been appealed. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in one of those cases and is seeking to begin enforcing the ban.",
      "There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department. A January report from the Congressional Research Service found that roughly 1,892 active-duty service members received gender-affirming care from the Pentagon between January 2016 and May 2021. A Feb. 26 memo from the Pentagon found that between 2015 and 2024, it spent $52 million on care for active-duty members of the military to treat gender dysphoria.",
      "A hiring freeze",
      "On his first day in the White House, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum freezing hiring of federal civilian employees, which he extended to July 15. Positions that were vacant as of his inauguration at noon on Jan. 20 should also not be filled, he said.",
      "The order was part of his plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, also a recommendation made in the Project 2025 policy roadmap.",
      "The book, though, warns that while \"reducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service,\" prior attempts to do so by presidents of both parties \"did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\"",
      "Instead, Project 2025 suggests a \"freeze on all top career-position hiring to prevent 'burrowing-in' by outgoing political appointees.\"",
      "Withdrawing from World Health Organization",
      "Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in 2020 due to what his first administration said was a mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden reversed that decision when he took office, and Mr. Trump rolled back that move on his first day back in the White House.",
      "His latest order directed the secretary of state to inform the secretary-general of the United States and World Health Organization leadership of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the group. Health officials in the U.S. and around the world have warned the move will leave people at greater risk of dangerous outbreaks and give China a more dominant role at the World Health Organization.",
      "Project 2025, too, criticized the World Health Organization for its handling of the pandemic.",
      "\"The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests,\" its book states.",
      "It said that when institutions act contrary to U.S. interests, the government \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response, up to and including withdrawal.\"",
      "Sending active-duty troops to the southern border",
      "Immigration was the topic of several executive actions taken by Mr. Trump on the first day of his presidency, including one order that assigns troops \"the mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the United States.\"",
      "The chapter of Project 2025's blueprint that covers the Department of Homeland Security was authored by Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration, and it, too, sees a role for the Defense Department in securing the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The Pentagon, Cucinelli writes, should \"explicitly acknowledge and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border traffic to legal ports of entry.\"",
      "A section on the Justice Department urges the next administration to \"take a creative and aggressive approach\" to tackling criminal organizations at the southern border.",
      "\"This could include use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border \u2014 something that has not yet been done,\" Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department states.",
      "Limiting refugee admissions",
      "Entry into the U.S. by refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was suspended earlier this year in accordance with an order by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20. His directive also orders the secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on applications for refugee status.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that during the Biden administration, the U.S. has been \"inundated\" with high levels of migration, including through the Refugee Admissions Program.",
      "Project 2025, too, blames the Biden administration for overseeing what it says was a \"collapse\" of U.S. border security and immigration enforcement. To address this \"crisis,\" Project 2025 calls for \"rightsizing refugee admissions.\"",
      "\"The federal government's obligation to shift national security\u2013essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions,\" its chapter on the State Department reads.",
      "The policy book calls for the State Department bureau that administers the Refugee Admissions Program to shift resources to challenges \"until the crisis can be contained and refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored.\"",
      "Rescinding temporary protected status designations",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, his administration has moved to end the Temporary Protected Status program for Haitians and Venezuelans.",
      "The TPS designation was created by Congress in 1990, and it allows the federal government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "A federal judge in late March agreed to delay the Trump administration's attempt to end the TPS program that shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, and a federal appeals court declined to pause that order while proceedings continue.",
      "Project 2025 calls on Congress to \"repeal temporary protected status designations.\"",
      "Capping indirect costs for university-based research",
      "The National Institutes of Health announced in a February memo that it would be capping the amount of funding for \"indirect costs\" at 15%, a cut from an average of between 27% and 28%. Indirect costs cover general expenses like facilities and administration.",
      "NIH said in its memo that it has spent billions on indirect costs for more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions across the country, and noted that \"most private foundations that fund research provide substantially lower indirect costs than the federal government, and universities readily accept grants from these foundations.\"",
      "Project 2025 also focused on indirect costs and called on Congress to \"cap the indirect cost rate paid to universities so that it does not exceed the lowest rate a university accepts from a private organization to fund search efforts.\"",
      "\"This market-based reform would help reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,\" the policy book read.",
      "While Project 2025 said it is up to Congress to cap the indirect cost rate, the Trump administration took this step unilaterally, prompting legal challenges from universities, states and organizations that represent medical colleges and schools.",
      "Universities and the NIH said the cuts will have a \"dire impact\" on lifesaving research, including clinical trials for cancer and Alzheimer's patients.",
      "Requiring disclosures of foreign gifts to universities",
      "As part of a series of executive orders addressing the education system, Mr. Trump issued a directive on April 23 that directs the education secretary to enforce a provision of the Higher Education Act that requires higher education institutions that receive federal dollars to disclose any gifts of contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year.",
      "The move is also part of Project 2025, which calls on the next administration to enforce that statute, investigate higher education institutions that do not honor the obligations laid out in the law and make \"appropriate referrals\" to the Justice Department.",
      "Asserting the president's power to remove federal officials",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to fire the members of independent agencies and inspectors general, despite federal laws that lay out the grounds for their removals.",
      "The terminations have sparked multiple court fights that appear aimed at asserting what the Trump administration believes is the president's unrestricted power to remove executive branch officials. But a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In a February letter to Congress, then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department \"intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions.\"",
      "Project 2025, too, suggested the next Republican presidential administration should seek the reversal of Humphrey's Executor.",
      "\"The next conservative administration should formally take the position that Humphrey's Executor violates the Constitution's separation of powers,\" it states.",
      "Targeting NOAA",
      "Project 2025's policy book calls for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, to be \"dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.\"",
      "The guide says NOAA's six main components should either be downsized or broken up, including Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, or OAR, which Project 2025 claims is the \"source of much of NOAA's climate alarmism.\"",
      "The Trump administration has proposed sweeping changes and job cuts for NOAA, including a 25% cut to its 2026 budget, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The proposal calls for OAR to be eliminated as an office, as well as funding for climate, weather and ocean laboratories, cooperative institutes and other programs.",
      "Current and former officials with NOAA have said the memo's objectives are \"devastating,\" and have argued that research is crucial to improving services such as severe weather forecasts\u00a0for the public.",

    "summary": "Despite President Trump's promise of cuts, the federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days than the same time period last year.",
    "story": [
      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories. Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "But even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent about $220 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",
      "Musk recently said his work with DOGE is winding down.",
      "Explore the spending details yourself",
      "You can explore the government's daily account ledgers for yourself. We've isolated the money spent by category in the first few months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period in each of the last 10 years.",
      "You can search for agencies or spending categories below to see the change over time and how much or less is being spent during this first 100 days of the Trump administration. We've limited the table to agencies and categories with at least $100 million in spending since Jan. 20, 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Canada's Liberal Party won Monday's federal election, marking a sharp political turnaround seemingly powered largely by the territorial threats and tariff tactics of President Trump.",
      "Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals were projected to win more of the Canadian Parliament's 343 seats than the rival Conservatives. It wasn't immediately clear if the Liberals would claim an outright majority of at least 172 seats, or if they'd be forced to rely on lawmakers from a smaller party or parties to get new legislation passed.",
      "Canadians decided with Monday's vote to grant the Liberal Party a fourth term in power, now with Carney at the helm, rather than to transfer control to the Conservatives and their populist leader Pierre Poilievre, who only months earlier had been projected to win the election decisively.",
      "The Liberal Party's popularity had been declining for years, eventually leading to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation in March, and the Conservatives appeared poised to take control of the federal government \u2014 until Mr. Trump stepped in.",
      "The American president's repeated\u00a0threats to annex Canada and his sweeping tariffs, which have undermined Canada's economy, dominated the campaign and influenced voters' choices. Domestic issues including affordability, immigration, jobs and crime remained significant factors.",
      "\"As I have been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never,\" declared Carney in a victory speech on Monday evening. \"These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Calling it a \"hinge moment\" in history, Carney said Canada's \"old relationship with the United States \u2014 a relationship based on steadily increasing integration \u2014 is over. The system of open global trade, anchored by the United States, a system that Canada has relied on since the Second World War, a system that, while not perfect, has helped deliver prosperity for our country for decades, is over. These are tragedies, but it's also our new reality... We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons. We have to look out for ourselves and, above all, we have to take care of each other.\"",
      "Poilievre, a seasoned politician for the Conservatives, lost his parliamentary seat in Ottawa, casting doubt on his continued leadership of the party. Monday's election marked a significant turn of events for the leader, who was first elected to the parliament in 2004.",
      "Despite the blow, Poilievre vowed to remain in his position as party leader, and he pledged in a speech Monday night to keep fighting for change.",
      "\"Every single day, our conservative caucus and I will be holding the government to account on behalf of millions of Canadians who believed in the message of change,\" Poilievre told his party's supporters.",
      "According to Elections Canada, a record number of Canadians \u2014 an estimated 7.3 million \u2014  cast their votes in advance, a 25% increase compared to the 2021 elections.",
      "A diverse group of voters gathered Monday inside a school gym in Milton City, Ontario, to cast their ballots. While they were divided on who would be best to deal with Mr. Trump, they all agreed that Canada's sovereignty, tariffs and the affordability of everyday goods were the main issues on their minds as they cast their votes.",
      "\"Trump's decisions are affecting not just Canada but the rest of the world,\" a couple who voted for the Liberals told CBS News outside a polling station. \"The tariffs affected the market; it affected prices of all goods, food, anything.\"",
      "Opponents cast the Conservatives' leader Poilievre as having similarities with Mr. Trump, which may have ended up costing him on election day.",
      "\"A couple of things that, unfortunately, Pierre has come out with which we didn't agree with,\" the couple in Milton City, who wished to remain anonymous, told CBS News. \"Might sound silly, but the fact he wants to bring back plastic bags and straws \u2014 I didn't like that idea.\"",
      "One voter named Peter said he considered the issue of Canadian sovereignty while casting his vote. Although he did not specify which party he believed could best address concerns over Mr. Trump's threats to make Canada a \"51st state,\" he stressed the need for Canadian unity.",
      "John Ivsky, a self-employed businessman from Milton, said he considered the election crucial, emphasizing the issue of tariffs. He said Canada should seek more and different global partners.",
      "\"Canada needs to build its own economy and broader partnerships,\" Ivsky told CBS News. \"America shouldn't be the only economic, military, or political partner. We need partners all over the world, so we don't suffer from one political change in one country.\"",
      "\"I respect and vote for every party that can support family values, conservative values, freedom of speech, and I vote for the one that can reflect my beliefs, whether that's Liberal or Conservative,\" said Ivsky. \"At this point, Conservatives are the ones that can do that.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump once again injected himself into the election campaign. In a post on Truth Social, he repeated his idea of making Canada the 51st U.S. state and called on Canadian voters to vote for the person who could make that possible \u2014 without naming either political party.",
      "\"Good luck to the Great people of Canada. Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size,\u00a0 WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st State of the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "In response to his remarks, Poilievre said Canada would never become the 51st state, and he urged the American president to stay out of Canadian elections.",
      "\"President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,\" Poilievre said in French in a social media\u00a0post. \"Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st State. Today Canadians can vote for change so we can strengthen our country, stand on our own two feet and stand up to America from a position of strength.\"",
      "In his campaign, Carney pleaded with voters to deliver him a strong mandate to deal with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"President Trump has some obsessive ideas, and that is one,\" Carney said of the annexation threats. \"It's not a joke. It's his very strong desire to make this happen. It's one of the reasons why this crisis is so serious.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump and his nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, have made claims about her certification and schooling that appear to be misleading.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to be the U.S. surgeon general, the Fox News contributor and family medicine physician Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, has described herself as a double board-certified physician with a degree from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine \u2014 credentials the president touted\u00a0in his announcement.",
      "But those claims about her certification and schooling appear to be misleading.",
      "Nesheiwat actually earned her medical degree from the American University of the Caribbean (AUC) School of Medicine, located in St. Maarten, in the Caribbean, according to records reviewed by CBS News. A spokesperson for the University of Arkansas confirmed to CBS News she completed her residency through its family medicine program in Fayetteville, Arkansas, but did not obtain her medical degree there.",
      "Nesheiwat has not yet come before the U.S. Senate's health committee for a confirmation hearing, where she is expected to face questions about her credentials. The U.S. surgeon general is known for setting the national agenda on public health. Past surgeons general have marshaled attention for priority issues such as the dangers of cigarette smoking, gun violence and an epidemic of loneliness.",
      "Currently, Nesheiwat's LinkedIn profile incorrectly lists a Doctor of Medicine from the University of Arkansas School of Medicine, while omitting any mention of AUC. In at least one instance on social media, she has referenced attending \"American University\" when describing her education \u2014 without clarifying that it was not the similarly named American University in Washington, D.C., which does not have a medical school. In that same posting she said she \"completed the majority of my studies in London, England, at St. Thomas & Guy's Hospital.\" CBS News was unable to verify that with the foundation that runs those London hospitals.",
      "Questions about Nesheiwat's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 were first reported by independent freelance writer Anthony Clark\u00a0on Substack.",
      "AUC's medical degree is generally a four-year program: the first two years consist of classroom training in St. Maarten, and the final two years consist of clinical rotations at a medical facility.",
      "According to AUC, Nesheiwat was enrolled at the school for six years, from 2000 to 2006.",
      "This extended enrollment period reflects broader concerns that have drawn federal attention in recent years and fueled stigma against medical schools in the Caribbean, which are sometimes perceived as a last resort for students who couldn't qualify for a U.S. medical school. The schools themselves and many graduates strongly dispute that assessment.",
      "Senators Dick Durbin and Bill Cassidy have introduced a bill in several congressional sessions aimed at closing a loophole that allowed certain Caribbean medical schools, including AUC, to bypass standards imposed on other foreign institutions. This loophole enabled the schools to remain eligible for federal funds despite lower on-time graduation rates. According to Durbin's office, students at these schools often take longer to complete their medical degrees, which results in higher debt and greater difficulty securing residency placements.",
      "\"They don't have to meet the same high standards U.S. medical schools must meet, but also don't have to meet the same requirements as schools located outside of the U.S. to access hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding,\" Durbin said.",
      "Some organizations, including the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, argue that these schools are important for helping to alleviate the physician shortage America is facing. The group's founder, Robert Goldberg, told CBS News, \"In a perfect world, everyone would tell the truth and something like this to me is not an issue.\"",
      "Goldberg says that in this time when some people are down on expertise, this could work to her advantage. \"Don't be afraid to talk about it. Maybe this will be a teachable moment for her,\" he said.",
      "The claims regarding her board certification have also raised questions. Nesheiwat is frequently described as double board-certified, including on her own website. The claim has gone unchallenged during her many past media appearances \u2014 including on CBS News. CBS News has only been able to verify her certification in family medicine.",
      "Nesheiwat's\u00a0Physcian Profile\u00a0for New York State only lists her certification in family medicine. The American Board of Medical Specialties, the largest and oldest certification organization in the U.S., told CBS News the only certification they had for her was for family medicine.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Nesheiwat and the White House for comment but have not received a response.",
      "Dr. Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University, says these inaccurate or misleading statements are \"very, very troubling.\" Caplan says the surgeon general's job \"depends on trust and credibility. You don't actually control anything. You are a spokesperson and educator for the public. If you begin by not being totally transparent or making a false claim about your training it's a really bad start.\"",
      "\"She must be to do the job crystal clear and transparent about her background, and being nervous about her background doesn't mean she should cover up her background,\" he told CBS News.",
      "In her 2024 autobiographical book, \"Beyond the Stethoscope: Miracles in Medicine,\" Nesheiwat makes no mention of her Caribbean medical education. Instead, she writes: \"I studied at the University of South Florida where I enrolled in an Army ROTC program. I did basic training in Fort Lewis, Washington, and completed my medical training at the University of Arkansas where I served as chief resident.\"",
      "Nesheiwat attended the University of South Florida for her undergraduate degree in biology and participated in Army ROTC. According to the U.S. Army Cadet Command, she completed the program's requirements but was \"medically disenrolled\" in June 2000, prior to commissioning as an officer.",
      "Her upbringing includes both personal tragedy and perseverance. Her family immigrated to the U.S. from Jordan following political unrest in the 1950s. At age 13, Nesheiwat was involved in a tragic accident in which she accidentally shot and killed her father. She and her four siblings were raised by her mother, who was a nurse.",
      "After completing her residency, Nesheiwat began working at CityMD, an urgent care provider in New York and New Jersey. She has been variously described in media appearances and press materials as \"medical director,\" \"CityMD Medical Director for emergency and family medicine,\" and \"a medical director at CityMD.\" On her website she describes herself as \"the Medical Director at CityMed.\" The exact nature of her role remains unclear. CBS News reached out to CityMD for clarification and received comment from the company's COO stating that \"She is an exceptional physician who truly stands out,\" but did not provide clarification on her job title or position at the company.",
      "Nesheiwat gained public visibility as a Fox News contributor during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering practical health advice and personal insights from her clinical work. As an urgent care physician practicing in the New York metropolitan area at the time, she saw firsthand COVID's devastating effects. Nesheiwat has acknowledged that she initially prescribed hydroxychloroquine but stopped when studies showed it was ineffective. She has said the COVID vaccine has been helpful but has also criticized the Biden administration over lockdowns during the pandemic.",
      "Her sister, Julia Nesheiwat, is a national security expert who served in the Obama administration and is married to Mike Waltz, a former member of Congress who now serves as national security adviser to President Trump.",
      "If confirmed, Neshewat would oversee 6,000 uniformed officers who are part of the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. She would also be in charge of communicating to the public about \"the best scientific information available on how to improve their health and reduce the risk of illness and injury.\"",
      "Some of her views may conflict with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spread the unfounded theory of a connection between vaccines and autism. In her book, she wrote: \"Science and rigorous testing have shown these vaccines to be safe and highly effective at suppressing disease. Leading to increased vaccine hesitancy has been the proliferation of poorly researched studies purporting to link vaccines to autism and other problems.\"",
      "A date for her Senate confirmation hearing has not yet been set, but sources tell CBS News it likely will be scheduled soon.",
      "Editor's note: This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to the relationship between AUC and a London hospital.",

      "The first set of data on office occupancy is due May 19, with reports expected every two weeks after that, the OMB memo states. The office is asking agencies for average daily occupancy figures, as well as annual reports on occupancy rates.",
      "According to the memo, the Trump administration is collecting this data as part of its push to \"shrink the Federal real estate footprint to eliminate unused and wasteful Federal office space.\" The reports will also be used to \"ensure compliance\" with Mr. Trump's return-to-office policy, the OMB said.",

      "He's expected to hit the highlights of his second term so far, including mass deportation operations, efforts to shrink the size and scope of government and the changes he's making to the global trade landscape. Those endeavors have not gone unopposed, prompting scores of lawsuits filed by ousted government employees, migrants fighting their deportation and business owners who argue the president's tariffs are unlawful.",

      "The Trump administration claims it has done more to secure the border in the president's first 100 days in office than any other president in history. Illegal border crossings\u00a0have reached\u00a0lows not seen in decades, and the administration has been working to deport migrants accused or convicted of violent crimes and drug-related offenses. But Mr. Trump's decision to invoke wartime authorities to send migrants to an El Salvador prison without due process has resulted in lawsuits, as has the president's efforts to end\u00a0birthright citizenship.",
      "The 100-day mark comes as the Trump administration is hashing out trade negotiations with countries across the world after Mr. Trump levied nearly worldwide tariffs on foreign imports, tariffs that most economists say will make goods more expensive and worsen economic prospects. Mr. Trump claimed in an interview with TIME that he's reached 200 trade deals with other countries since April 2, but declined to name any of the countries. Americans are skeptical of the president's tariff approach, CBS News polling shows, and most worry they'll contribute to higher prices at a time when high prices are a top concern for voters.",
      "It's unclear how much the president will focus on foreign policy matters, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued the administration has made significant progress on the foreign policy front. After repeatedly saying he would end the war in Ukraine before even taking office, Mr. Trump is now saying those comments were made in \"jest.\"",
      "\"We are closer today to a peace deal in Russia and Ukraine, certainly, than we were when we took office on Jan. 20,\" Leavitt told reporters Monday. \"If you look at the situation in the Middle East, Israel has never had a stronger friend than they do right now in the Oval Office with President Trump.

Mr. Trump's use of executive authority over the past 100 days also surpasses the number of executive orders signed by Obama and Bush during their entire second terms. Obama hit 129 executive orders, and Bush 118.",

      "\"Latino voters are frustrated that their economic priorities are being ignored and that a key promise made by President Trump during the election is not being kept,\" said UnidosUS President Janet Murgu\u00eda. \"Economic discontent was the most potent driver in the 2024 election, helping President Trump increase support among Latinos.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made significant gains among Latino voters last year. Just 53% of Latino voters backed Harris, compared to the 65% won by former President Joe Biden in 2020, according to exit polling data. Some 54% of Latino men voted for Mr. Trump, with the economy ranking as their top issue.",
      "Aside from the economy, according to Murgu\u00eda, deportations are contributing to the overall negative sentiment. The majority of Latinos polled support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for a long time or who were brought into the country as children. Some 78% said they believe it's important to deport dangerous criminals but Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans should not target long-residing undocumented immigrants without criminal records.",
      "Of those polled, 43% said they fear immigration authorities will arrest them even if they're U.S. citizens or have legal status.",
      "According to the latest CBS News poll released Sunday, Mr. Trump continues to get majority approval for his deportation program among all Americans, but 56% of Hispanic voters disapprove. Some 81% of respondents say it is not acceptable if legal U.S. residents are mistakenly deported, including 84% of Hispanic respondents.",
      "While there is dissatisfaction with the current administration and Republicans in Congress, Barreto and Shaw indicate there is room for both parties to work on improving trust among the Latino community. When asked to describe the party's attitude toward Latinos, 35% said Democrats \"don't care too much\" and 37% said the same for Republicans, according to Barreto and Shaw's poll.",
      "\"We identified this particular finding as a message for both political parties to be able to position themselves so that they actually look like they care about the Hisapnic community,\" said Barreto.",
      "As for policies floated during Mr. Trump's first 100 days, Latinos showed support for requiring proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections and renewing 2017 tax cuts that lower federal income tax rates for those making less than $200,000 a year.",
      "Latino voters largely opposed allowing federal enforcement of immigration laws in public schools, and granting Immigration and Customs Enforcement access to tax identification numbers used by undocumented immigrants to pay taxes for the purposes of mass deportations.",
      "\"Our poll confirms that with the polarized electorate and slim margins in Congress, neither party can afford to ignore or take for granted the Latino vote,\" said Murgu\u00eda. \"Doing the work to understand and meaningfully engage this increasing and critically important electorate must be a priority.\"",
      "Looking ahead to 2026's midterm elections, Republicans are in trouble if the economy does not show major improvement and Latinos continue to live in fear over deportations, according to the pollsters behind the findings. The warning signs for the Democratic party, however, also lie in the 60% of Latino voters who said they believe Democrats should fight hard against the Trump administration and his policies.",

    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials have told some scientists and inspections staff that their layoffs will be reversed, after the job cuts led to disruptions in drug and food safety work.",
      "The move marks a significant reversal of a portion of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs. Kennedy initially planned to cut 3,500 employees from the FDA.",
      "In team-wide meetings that started last week, multiple FDA employees said they were informed by their supervisors that they should expect to have their layoffs reversed.",
      "Among the laid-off staff told they would be brought back are scientists for drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit as well as food safety labs\u00a0in Chicago and San Francisco. A handful of support staff for the FDA's inspectors are also being brought back.",
      "Multiple FDA scientists said they were eager to go back to work, though they had yet to receive official paperwork for reversing the layoffs.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the FDA's food safety labs were being reinstated.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services blamed errors in the layoffs on inaccurate data from the department's \"siloed HR divisions.\"",
      "\"This is exactly why HHS is reorganizing its administrative functions to streamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us by the Biden Administration. Streamlining this into one operation will allow for enhanced data integrity and coordination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said some layoffs would be walked back, like to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's lead poisoning teams. But that reversal never ended up happening, leaving the agency's lead poisoning work largely abandoned.",
      "Some CDC laboratories also remain closed, including the agency's now-shuttered labs for investigating outbreaks of hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases or for worker safety, like oversight of N95 masks.",
      "FDA inspections falling behind",
      "Around two dozen of the support staff for the FDA's inspectors have been told their layoffs would be reversed, out of nearly 200 who were cut. The employees being restored are focused on booking travel for foreign inspections.",
      "Cuts to the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations have taken a steep toll on the agency's inspections, especially for overseas manufacturers of drugs and food products.",
      "A pilot program started under the Biden administration to expand unannounced foreign inspections stalled due to the cuts, multiple officials said. In a recent week, one FDA official said less than 60% of the agency's planned foreign inspections had been completed.",
      "Sidelined inspectors of foreign firms have been asked to find ways to \"pivot to\" local inspections they can do within the U.S. instead, according to internal emails shared with CBS News. More than $700,000 of expenses incurred by inspectors have also yet to be paid, an official said, due to the layoffs to support staff.",
      "Hopes by FDA leaders to increase inspections have also run up against an ongoing federal hiring freeze, officials said, especially as the ranks of supervisors for inspectors have been depleted by early retirements and resignations.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary had initially greenlighted a plan to use contractors to fill the gap, before the department moved to reverse some of the layoffs.",
      "FDA drug safety work stalls",
      "Multiple current and laid-off FDA employees said the abrupt layoffs had resulted in delays and disruptions to the agency's drug safety work. Virtually all the scientists in the FDA's San Juan and Detroit labs were cut, leaving only labs in New York and Irvine, California.",
      "The FDA labs in Detroit and San Juan had also been responsible for checking the shelf life of medical treatments stockpiled by the federal government for the military and pandemics, under a program administered by the Department of Defense.",
      "The layoffs also cut chemists based out of the labs who worked as foreign inspectors for the FDA, often assigned to travel with badge-carrying investigators to help with more complex or urgent frontline inspections of drugmakers.",
      "Some of the agency's work to detect and investigate fraudulent medical products had also effectively stalled, they said, amid complications around transferring the custody of the samples and a backlog of work that predated the April 1 layoffs.",

      "Nearly 100 former employees and prosecutors for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., have signed a memo opposing President Trump's nominee to lead the office.",
      "The memo is the latest effort by critics of acting D.C. U.S. Attorney Ed Martin to stop his Senate confirmation for the permanent role, which is among the most powerful federal prosecutor positions in the country. The letter was signed by a group of former prosecutors who served in the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office across seven decades, under administrations from Lyndon B. Johnson's through Joe Biden's.",
      "The memo, a copy of which was shared with CBS News, called for the rejection fo Martin's nomination.",
      "\"There is a time when we all are called to stand for the full and fair administration of justice and the rule of law,\" the memo says. \"For those of us who have served in the Office of the United States Attorney and still have a breath, that time is now. And the message we speak is, reject \u2014 outright and completely \u2014 the proposed nominee. Whether our message is futile or not, it is an expression of our conscience and a matter of principle that we deliver with all of the strength that we can muster.\"",
      "Martin began serving as interim U.S. attorney for D.C. hours after President Trump's inauguration and was soon nominated for the Senate-confirmed post.",
      "His nomination has been a flashpoint of controversy since the beginning of the Trump administration. Martin lacks any prosecutorial experience, served as an advocate in the \"Stop the Steal\" movement denying the 2020 election results, worked as a defense lawyer on Jan. 6 Capitol riot cases and fired some of the lawyers who prosecuted Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "Senate Democrats have blasted Martin's selection, with Sen. Adam Schiff, a first-term California Democrat, calling Martin unqualified and dangerous for the role of U.S. attorney. Schiff has placed a hold on Martin's nomination, seeking to slow down the confirmation process.",
      "Schiff and other Senate Democrats have also requested a confirmation hearing be held for Martin's nomination, which \u2014 if approved \u2014 would be the first confirmation hearing for a U.S. attorney nominee in 40 years.",
      "Some of the group of nearly 100 former assistant U.S. attorneys who are lobbying against Martin's nomination told CBS News they know they must make inroads with Senate Republicans on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "Dan Toomey, who served in the U.S. Attorney's Office from 1968 to 1971 told CBS News the group of former prosecutors has yet to secure a meeting with Republican Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa.",
      "\"We have talked to Sen. Grassley's staff and we have also talked to Senator John Kennedy's staff,\" Toomey said. We had a half-hour meeting with them.\"",
      "Toomey acknowledged the Republican senators are likely the only firewall to stop Martin's confirmation and said securing the backing of some of those senators is \"really important and really our only hope.\"",
      "Charles Work, a former federal prosecutor who worked at the U.S. Attorney's Office for D.C. in the 1970s and signed the memo opposing Martin, said the office is struggling under Martin's interim leadership.",
      "\"The morale is gone,\" Work said. \"People are hiding from assignments. They don't know what to do. They don't know whether to resign.\"",
      "In their newly released memo, the former prosecutors argued, \"(Martin's) refusals to acknowledge the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election and the illegality in the conduct of 1600 individuals who overran the police and the Capitol on January 6, 2021, causing physical harm to dozens and potentially irreparable damage to the institution of democratic governance are in and of themselves disqualifying. As well, these misbehaviors are cues to where the nominee will go if ceded the position of United States Attorney.\"",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who would vote on Martin's nomination in the Judiciary Committee, did not directly answer when he was asked Monday if he has any concerns about Martin's nomination.

    "story": [
      "Is 100 days enough time to evaluate this president? His supporters generally don't think so, but others do \u2014 perhaps because most Americans think President Trump is already making major changes to how the government \u2014 and the U.S. economy \u2014 work.",
      "Those opening days, in public opinion terms, have been marked by Mr. Trump's continued support from a loyal base of supporters, but also a widespread and growing belief among others that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. That's weighing on his approval ratings on the economy and inflation, which have gone down.",
      "Alongside that, he continues to get majority approval for his deportation program, though more Americans prioritize the economy in their evaluations of him.",
      "MAGA Republicans, in contrast, say their evaluations are based more on immigration and overwhelmingly approve of his efforts there. Plus they have a much rosier outlook on the U.S. economy than Americans overall now that Trump is in office, and most of them say it is too soon to judge him.",
      "Others who voted for him, but who don't identify as MAGA, have become a little less approving of his handling of the economy and inflation in recent months. And since the start of his term, his approval rating has slid among some groups he made gains with in the 2024 election, including independents, young people, and Hispanic people.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump sees disapproval on the economy from those who think he's put too much focus on tariffs.",
      "And meanwhile, Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove of what they see from him, want their party to oppose him more and say they're \"frustrated\" with the Democratic Party's response so far. Mr. Trump's approval rating among people who sat out the '24 election started out higher, too.",
      "Those perceived changes elicit different judgments, though. Republicans say they are for the better, and Democrats, the worse. Asked how Trump's presidency so far has made them feel, most Republicans say they're satisfied, while Democrats and independents say they're frustrated and nervous.",
      "Measuring a president at 100 days is something of a contrivance that is based on a marker set during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term back in the 1930s. Then again, many presidents come in promising a lot of action quickly. Most Americans do think they can judge this administration in that time frame. Mr. Trump's 2024 voters, and most of his current approvers, are less likely to think it's enough time, whereas his disapprovers think it's enough.",
      "Tariffs, promises and prices",
      "Mr. Trump's voters widely believe he's doing what he promised in the campaign. Most of the public agrees \u2014 whether or not they like what he's doing \u2014 though the percentage is down from the early weeks of his term.",
      "People who think Mr. Trump is putting too much focus on tariffs are more likely to say he's doing different things from what he promised.",
      "Here's how differences on economics play out:",
      "MAGA Republicans stand apart in their outlook for the U.S. economy. While most Americans say it is getting worse, MAGA Republicans say it is getting better. They also rate the current economy much better than others do. So, while evaluations of the economy remain mostly bad, Republicans' views have pushed the overall ratings up a bit, with an even larger partisan gap now.",
      "Overall, more Americans continue to say Trump's policies are making them financially worse off than better off. Expectations at the start of his term were different \u2014 more expected his policies to improve their finances.",
      "Two-thirds of those who think they're being made worse off say he isn't doing what he promised.",
      "And that has led to declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation, specifically. Both ratings are now their lowest levels of the term so far. His rating on inflation is driven very much by the impact of his policies people see on prices.",
      "Support for tariffs has been declining, as a rising number of Americans feel the administration is focusing too much on the issue. And over recent weeks, fewer now believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan for tariffs and trade.",
      "When asked to pick what issue is most important to them in judging the Trump administration, the economy and immigration top the list. Those judging Mr. Trump on immigration heavily approve of his overall job performance, while those judging him on the economy disapprove in large numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump's overall approval rating is down from the high at the start of this term.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "Most Americans think Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings. Most also continue to approve of his deportation program in general.",
      "Meanwhile, three-quarters say it isn't acceptable if some legal residents are detained by mistake as part of that program. A large 8 in 10 say it wouldn't be acceptable if some legal residents are deported to foreign countries.",
      "And most who don't think these things would be acceptable disapprove of his overall handling of immigration.",
      "(On this, MAGA Republicans do stand differently from others, coming in about twice as likely as Americans overall to say legal residents being detained would be acceptable.)",
      "It may be that the perceived implementation of the deportation plan is affecting larger views of how Mr. Trump is handling immigration, even as a majority approve of the deportation program in general. On balance, his handling of immigration, generally, is lower than it was earlier in term. Independents, especially those with college degrees, have become less approving over time.",
      "Most Americans also think Mr. Trump is trying to expand the powers of the presidency \u2014 a view driven heavily by Democrats and those who disapprove of his job performance. And those who think he is are more likely to feel democracy and rule of law in the U.S. is threatened.",
      "Most Americans do support limits to Mr. Trump's powers as president, though. A majority think he should get his policies enacted by working with Congress to pass legislation rather than through executive orders, and majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents alike feel Mr. Trump should follow a Supreme Court ruling if it goes against his administration. Republicans also say their party in Congress should push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree with him.",
      "And on the other side of the aisle, many Democrats describe their feelings about how their party is handling the Trump administration as making them feel frustrated and nervous.",

But one day after a CBS News report about the prospect that the hotline would be shuttered, the organization's director notified CBS News that the Justice Department restored the grant money.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News the organizations that have lost their grant funding awards will have 30 days to appeal the decision.",
      "\"We are confident that these cuts are consistent with the administration's priorities while at the same time protecting services that tangibly impact victims,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The list of 365 grant programs notified of grant cancellations includes a broad array of initiatives to help crime victims and prevent violence.",
      "The impacted organizations include a San Francisco-based organization that seeks to reduce hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, a New York organization that works to reduce school shootings, the \"Emmett Till cold case investigations and prosecution program\" in New Orleans, the \"Matthew Shepard and James Byrd hate crimes training and technical assistance\" initiative for crime reduction in Florida, a Michigan group that supports re-entry for young offenders and a Virginia group that helps human trafficking and sex victims.",
      "Renee Williams, the executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime, said she's grateful the Justice Department restored her grant funding, but told CBS News \"our partners are still battling.\" Williams said the organization's crime victim hotline is a critical tool for those who suffer violence. Williams told CBS News, \"After calling us, countless victims indicated that they had nowhere else to turn, but found hope, help, and comfort from our services.\"",
      "Joe Griffin, executive of director of California-based Youth Alive! told CBS News the interruption of his group's federal grant would have a devastating impact on community initiatives.",
      "\"To do this ahead of summer, when we know there will likely be an uptick in violence, is really troubling,\" Griffin said. \"We need our government to show up for our young people the way we do\u2014every day, without fail.\"",
      "Other projects that were notified of terminations of their federal grants include the following:",
      "A Memphis, Tennessee, group that helps provide victims advocacy and support for non-English speaking crime victimsAn Atlanta project that supports crime victims under the age of 18A Bronx, N.Y., initiative to prevent overdosesA Chicago-based study of elder-abuse victimsA Florida project to help ensure the safety of correctional officersA Virginia-based project to help human trafficking victims.",

      "CBS News covered the spill for four months, from the frantic efforts to cap the well to bungled attempts to stop the rust-colored crude oil from poisoning beaches and wetlands.

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 10:39:24 -0400",
    "summary": "A large brood of periodical cicadas is due to emerge in the spring of 2025. These maps show where people should expect to see and hear the bugs this year.",
    "story": [
      "Cicadas are poised to return at some point in the spring of 2025, potentially bringing billions of bugs to neighborhoods across the eastern United States.",
      "The group of cicadas set to appear has been labeled Brood XIV. Emerging once every 17 years, Brood XIV is the second-largest group of periodical cicadas \u2014 which rise from underground en masse \u2014 and will be the only group this spring. That means\u00a0there will likely be fewer cicadas\u00a0above ground than there were in 2024, when\u00a0multiple broods of cicadas\u00a0emerged at the same time.",
      "Where will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "Cicadas this year will likely be concentrated in Kentucky and much of Tennessee. The insects from Brood XIV are also expected to show up in parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia, in addition to smaller pockets farther north in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, central Pennsylvania and Long Island, New York.",
      "CBS News' data team created an interactive map that shows where cicadas are expected to be this year. The map uses information from the University of Connecticut's Cicada Project, which plots the brood's spread based on its known locations in the past.",
      "When will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",
      "The huge groups of cicadas emerge when the soil reaches about 64 degrees Fahrenheit, according to University of Connecticut researchers. In warmer states, cicadas usually come out in late April or May. In cooler states, their arrival tends to occur in May or early June.",
      "How long will cicadas be above ground?",
      "Researchers say cicadas typically remain in a given area for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Most individual cicadas live for just a few weeks, but, since the emergence itself happens over two weeks, their eventual fading will also be staggered.",
      "What are cicadas?",
      "Cicadas are a type of insect, related to stink bugs, bed buds and aphids. The ones expected to arrive in droves this year are a variety called periodical cicadas, which appear in huge swarms and often create loud buzzing sounds, according to the National Wildlife Federation. Annual cicadas exist as well.",
      "Periodical cicadas have earned a reputation across eastern North America because of their conspicuous recurrence. Individual \"broods\" are biologically synchronized to crop up simultaneously in 13- or 17-year intervals, when they rise from their burrows underground in populations that can reach up to the trillions. Between intervals, they live in soil as larvae and feed on fluids from plant roots, the wildlife federation explains.",
      "There are three species of cicadas that emerge every 17 years, and four species that materialize every 13 years, according to researchers at the University of Connecticut. When cicadas share the same emergence year, they're considered part of a brood.",

      "Active periodical cicada broods in the U.S.",
      "Select a brood:",
      "Why do cicadas make noise?",
      "The noise people often hear from cicadas is a mating tactic, according to the wildlife foundation, which notes that male cicadas tend to crowd together and produce raucous choruses in efforts to attract females. Once the mating process has ended, female cicadas deposit their eggs in tree branches. When they hatch, the larvae fall to the ground, burrow into the soil, and the cycle starts again.",

    "summary": "A notably large brood of periodical cicadas will emerge from the underground across parts of the eastern U.S. this spring.",
    "story": [
      "A massive brood of periodical cicadas will emerge soon across the eastern United States, with the notoriously raucous springtime insects due for their 2025 appearance.",
      "Known for their buzzing hordes and ability to rapidly infiltrate the environments where they show up, cicadas are expected to swarm parts of Kentucky and Tennessee\u00a0this year, while arriving in smaller quantities in various places along the East Coast, from Massachusetts and New York down to western Georgia.",
      "Here's what to know about the infamous creatures.",
      "What are periodical cicadas?",
      "Periodical cicadas are moderately sized bugs with red eyes and translucent wings, usually measuring about an inch long with a wider wingspan. They are sometimes mistakenly associated with locusts, like grasshoppers, but cicadas are actually an entirely different sort of insect, part of the same family as stink bugs and bedbugs.",
      "The synchronized behavior of periodical cicadas is their most defining characteristic. Compared with annual cicadas, which appear in generally modest amounts each summer, periodical cicadas emerge in the spring and essentially rise from the ground in unison, in either 13-year or 17-year intervals. Cicadas that emerge on the same schedule are called a brood, and each is labeled using Roman numerals.",
      "This year, the group belongs to Brood XIV, the second-largest brood of periodical cicadas known to scientists, according to the University of Connecticut. Researchers with the university's Cicada Project note that, while they cannot technically know with certainty where a particular brood is going to emerge next, its last known locations during previous emergence events usually provide valuable insights. Because periodical cicadas typically lay their eggs in or near the areas where they've just emerged, the next generation of broods tend to emerge themselves in similar places.",
      "Cicada map predicts where they will emerge in 2025",
      "Based on University of Connecticut research, CBS News' data team created an interactive map that charts the expected spread of Brood XIV, which last arose 17 years ago and is the only brood emerging in 2025.",
      "The map shows the cicadas primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, in addition to parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Farther north, the brood is also expected to take shape in smaller pockets, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Long Island, New York; and central Pennsylvania.",
      "When will Brood XIV emerge?",
      "The brood will emerge before the end of spring on June 21, but cicadas' arrivals in different parts of the U.S. will likely vary.",
      "Cicada expert Matthew Kasson told CBS News in 2024 that\u00a0the exact timing of a brood's emergence\u00a0is linked to the temperature of the soil they're in before moving above ground. Kasson said cicadas are prompted to exit the soil when it reaches 64 degrees, so groups within the larger brood may travel to the surface sooner than others in cooler locations.",
      "What do cicadas do?",
      "The life cycles of periodical cicadas are closely tied to how and where they emerge. Before a brood materializes on land, each of its members \u2014 sometimes trillions of them \u2014 exist underground as larvae, subsiding on fluids from plant roots, according to the National Wildlife Federation. They live in those conditions for 13 or 17 years, depending on their brood. Then, almost all at once, the insects burrow upward and break through the surface of the soil, often making their presence known by erupting in loud and at times constant choruses.",
      "Conspicuous noises from cicada swarms are a mating tactic, the wildlife federation writes, as the male insects gather in groups and create loud sounds to attract females. The mating process begins within a few days of cicadas emerging. When it ends, the females cut shallow grooves into tree branches and lay their eggs inside. Researchers at Arizona State University say\u00a0those eggs usually hatch\u00a0within 8 weeks, and newly born cicadas fall from the branches down to the ground. Called nymphs at that point, the young bugs proceed to dig their way back underneath the soil, where they remain until it's time to emerge again.",
      "Adult cicadas typically remain above ground in a given location for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Researchers note that most of the individual insects live for less time, but that window accounts for some degree of staggering when the brood emerges, since that happens over a period of about two weeks.",
      "Are cicadas dangerous?",
      "Cicadas are not dangerous to humans or pets, experts say. They don't bite or sting and they aren't poisonous or venomous.",
      "\"If dogs or cats eat many cicadas, this may temporarily cause an upset stomach or vomiting, but there is no need to worry if a pet eats a small number of cicadas,\" the Environmental Protection Agency says.",
      "They are also largely beneficial to the ecosystem. They are a food source for birds and other predators that eat insects. They can aerate soil, and when they decompose, they provide nutrients that can help trees grow.",
      "Cicadas may harm young trees, which can be protected with mesh or netting. They don't eat leaves, flowers, fruits or garden produce, the EPA says.",

      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",

      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",
      "\"Companies are very cautious before they sink millions of dollars into a well or to a mining project,\" he said. \"So I think they benefit from going slowly because they don't want to be stuck with a stranded asset or literally drill a dry hole here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Harmful bleaching of the world's coral has grown to include 84% of the ocean's reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history, the International Coral Reef Initiative announced Wednesday.",
      "It's the fourth global bleaching event since 1998 and has now surpassed bleaching from 2014-17 that hit some two-thirds of reefs, said the ICRI, a mix of more than 100 governments, non-governmental organizations and others. And it's not clear when the current crisis, which began in 2023 and is blamed on warming oceans, will end.",
      "\"We may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event,\" said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\"We're looking at something that's completely changing the face of our planet and the ability of our oceans to sustain lives and livelihoods,\" Eakin said.",
      "Reefs in the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans are affected.",
      "The coral bleaching culprit? Climate change",
      "Last year was Earth's hottest year on record, and much of that heat is going into oceans. The average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles was a record 69.57 degrees.",
      "That's deadly to corals, which are essential ecosystems \u2014 keys to seafood production and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms \u2014 and big tourist draws. Coral reefs are sometimes dubbed \"rainforests of the sea\" because they support high levels of biodiversity \u2014 approximately 25% of all marine species can be found in, on and around coral reefs.",
      "Coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them and are a food source for the corals. Prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds and the coral eject them. A stark white skeleton is left behind and the weakened coral is at heightened risk of dying.",
      "The bleaching event has been so severe that NOAA's Coral Reef Watch program has had to add levels to its bleaching alert scale to account for the growing risk of coral death.",
      "The answer? Curb climate change, experts say",
      "Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral. One Dutch lab has worked with coral fragments, including some taken from off the coast of the Seychelles, to propagate them in a zoo so they might be used someday to repopulate wild coral reefs if needed. Other projects, including one off Florida, have worked to rescue corals endangered by high heat and nurse them back to health before returning them to the ocean.",
      "But scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, such as those of carbon dioxide and methane.",
      "\"The best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels ... everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,\" Eakin said.",
      "\"I think people really need to recognize what they're doing ... inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs,\" said Melanie McField, co-chair of the Caribbean Steering Committee for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, a network of scientists that monitors reefs throughout the world.",
      "The group's update comes as President Trump has moved aggressively in his second term to boost fossil fuels and roll back clean energy programs, which he says is necessary for economic growth.",
      "\"We've got a government right now that is working very hard to destroy all of these ecosystems ... removing these protections is going to have devastating consequences,\" Eakin said.",

      "Just as Americans saw the internet as a harbinger of major change a quarter century ago, a majority today feel artificial intelligence will have a big effect on society. But more so than the internet at the time, AI is seen by many as creating more problems than it solves, with misleading AI content and AI companies' impact on the economy both areas of concern.",
      "AI's perceived impact on work looks especially mixed. More think AI will make jobs in their field easier than harder, but relatedly, Americans are likelier to see AI as decreasing than increasing the number of jobs available.",
      "There are large differences by educational attainment, with college degree holders more likely than those without degrees to say it will make jobs easier in their field. That suggests that when it comes to the way people do their work, the public mainly sees AI impacting computer-based and white-collar jobs.",
      "College grads are also likelier than those without college degrees to see the development of AI and AI companies as good for the economy. That said, the view that AI is more likely to reduce than increase the number of jobs is broad-based, spanning all levels of educational attainment.",
      "Americans are quite mixed on AI's potential impact on the economy. On balance, they are more likely to see the development of AI and AI companies as being bad for the economy than good. This is a major difference in sentiment from the early internet years. In CBS News polling done in 1999, seven in 10 felt the \"rapid growth in the number of internet companies\" was good for the economy. Notably, Americans are also much less optimistic than AI experts, particularly on the potential benefits of the technology for work and the economy.",

      "The list of things people feel AI does worse than humans is wide-ranging and instructive. Some lean more on interpersonal skills, like providing customer service. Some involve creativity, like creating art, which AI is seen as worse at by a wide margin. The other items may be seen as more dependent on judgment and involving higher stakes. These include medical diagnoses, financial decisions and the item on which the largest majority say AI is worse: driving a car.",
      "People are very mixed on whether AI can produce accurate information better than humans can today. And whether it can or not, half of Americans are very concerned about AI being used to create false or misleading pictures, information, and videos. Nine in 10 are at least somewhat concerned about it.",

Among people who don't use AI themselves \u2014 a category most Americans are in \u2014 most don't feel they can distinguish even somewhat well.",
      "Public understanding and personal use of AI",
      "Two-thirds feel they have a good understanding of AI. That matches the levels seen in our 1999 polling on the internet, and we see similar demographic breaks now as we did then. Americans today are much likelier to say their understanding is somewhat good than very good, suggesting room for it to grow in the coming years.",
      "There are stark divides in AI understanding and use by age. Eight in 10 Americans under the age of 45 feel they have a good understanding, while that number falls to only about half of Americans 65 and older. College degree holders report higher levels of than other Americans, as do men relative to women. Men are also more positive than women on AI's economic impact.",
      "Most don't feel it's necessary to use AI these days to keep up with the times. Four in 10 say they personally use AI, and those who do are likelier to say it's for personal use than for work. The few who use it mostly for work report greater understanding of AI and tend to feel it will make jobs in their field easier to do.",
      "The share who say people must use AI to keep up is close to the four in 10 who said so about the internet in 1999. And as was the case back then, early adopters skew young and male. And younger people are more likely to say they use AI for work purposes.",
      "Six in 10 say artificial intelligence will have a bigger effect on society than the internet did. That is significant, as the internet itself was seen as bringing about big change in its early years. In 1999, Gallup polling found that most Americans felt it was going to change society more than the introduction of the telephone and television.",

    "story": [
      "Scammers are using artificial intelligence to alter their appearance and build fake profiles to apply for remote job postings, research shows.",
      "Already, scammers can use AI at almost every step in the job application process to hide their true identities. They can generate fake resumes, professional headshots, websites and Linkedin profiles. Compiled together, AI can help create what looks like the perfect candidate for an open role.",
      "Once they're in, these fraudsters can steal company secrets or install malware.",
      "While identity theft is not new, AI is helping scammers scale their operations, and the problem is growing. According to research and advisory firm Gartner,\u00a0an estimated one in four job applicants will be fake by 2028.",
      "How to spot a fake",
      "A recording of an interview with what appeared to be an AI-generated job seeker went viral on LinkedIn, posted by Dawid Moczadlo, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Vidoc Security. He told CBS News he was shocked when he realized what was happening.",
      "\"I felt a little bit violated, because we are the security experts,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "Moczadlo said when he suspected the person was using an AI filter, he asked a simple question: \"Can you take your hand and put it in front of your face?\"",
      "When they refused, Moczadlo immediately ended the interview. He explained that the software the scammer was using didn't seem sophisticated, so blocking the person's face with their hand would likely \"break\" the deepfake face filter.",
      "\"Sometimes it takes a hacker to find a hacker,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "This was the second time the company had interviewed someone who turned out to be AI-generated. Moczadlo said it completely changed the company's hiring process. Now, potential employees are flown in for a one-day, in-person interview. The company covers travel and pays for a full day of work. It believes the extra cost is worth the peace of mind.",
      "A pattern of deception",
      "These incidents aren't isolated. The Justice Department has uncovered multiple networks in which North Koreans used fake identities to land remote jobs in the U.S. They often use AI to build fake identities and work U.S.-based IT jobs to funnel U.S. dollars to their home country.",
      "The Justice Department estimates these schemes generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with much of those funds going directly to the North Korean Ministry of Defense and the country's nuclear missile program.",
      "Moczadlo said researchers told him Vidoc's fake job seekers followed a similar pattern to several of these North Korean networks, though Vidoc's incident is still under investigation.",
      "\"We are really lucky that we are security experts.\" Moczadlo added, \"but for companies that have regular people like hiring managers or regular startup founders, it's really hard for them to spot something like this.\"",
      "The reaction inspired Vidoc's co-founders to build a guide to help HR professionals across industries spot potentially fraudulent applicants.",
      "If you're wondering if this has ever happened to you, the CBS News Confirmed team has compiled some general best-practices to check that the person you're speaking to is real:",
      "1. Look closer at their LinkedIn profile: While the profile might look legitimate at first glance, check the creation date by clicking on the \"More\" button and then selecting \"About this profile.\" You can also check that the person has connections at the places they say they've worked.",
      "2. Ask cultural questions: If someone says they grew up in a specific country or city, ask about things only a local might know, like their favorite cafes and restaurants.",
      "3. In-person is best: At the end of the day, especially as AI technology advances, the only way to really know that a person is who they say they are, is to meet them face-to-face.",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

      "UPS on Tuesday announced it is planning to cut 20,000 jobs this year, part of a cost-cutting effort that's linked to the delivery giant's decision to deliver fewer packages from Amazon, its biggest customer.",
      "The shipping company, which operates in over 200 countries, currently has around 490,000 employees. The layoffs will impact slightly over 4% of its workforce. This follows an announcement from UPS last year that it would cut 12,000 positions.",
      "The move is part of the company's plan to consolidate UPS's facilities and workforce. Along with the job cuts, the company announced it will also close 73 of its buildings by the end of June 2025 and said that it may target additional buildings for closure.",
      "\"These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability,\" Brian Dykes, the chief financial officer of UPS said during an earnings call on Tuesday morning.",
      "In a Tuesday regulatory filing, UPS said the cuts are in \"connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.\" The company, which announced $21.5 billion in revenue for this past quarter, expects to save $3.5 billion this year as a result of its consolidation plan.",
      "According to Sean M. O'Brien, the Teamsters general president, UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under their current national master agreement.",
      "\"If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won't stand in its way,\" O'Brien said. \"But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.\"",
      "\"Strong\" relationship with Amazon",
      "The company in January\u00a0said it had reached an agreement with Amazon to decrease its delivery volume by more than 50% in the second half of 2026.",
      "\"The reduction of package volume from Amazon is something UPS chose to do as we focus on revenue quality, and increase domestic operating margin and profitability,\" a UPS spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",

      "\"Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision,\" said Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson. \"We'll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.",
      "UPS delivers millions of packages worldwide each year. Last year, the company delivered an average of 22.4 million parcels per day, or 5.7 billion for the entire year.",
      "UPS shares slipped 55 cents, or 0.6%, to $96.61 in afternoon trading.",
      "Trade risks rising",
      "In its\u00a0quarterly earnings statement, the company also mentioned the risk that shifts in global trade policy could have on business. The Trump administration has introduced sweeping new tariffs in recent months that have already began to impact the flow of goods in and out of the country, and around the world.",
      "UPS handles roughly 400,000 imported parcels each day, or roughly 2% of the packages they move on a daily basis. Still, the company could be impacted if the trade war between China and the U.S. continues.",
      "\"From a revenue perspective, last year, revenue on our China to U.S. trade lanes represented 11% of our total international revenue,\" said CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said during Tuesday's earning call. \"Our China to U.S. trade lines are our most profitable trade lines.\"",
      "UPS is keeping customers abreast of tariff developments on its\u00a0website. It has also introduced a\u00a0tool\u00a0called UPS Global Checkout that shows online shoppers the upfront costs they will have to pay in duties, fees and taxes.",

Yet, despite promises from Trump administration officials to run \"the most transparent Defense Department in history,\" the Pentagon has held just one formal briefing in the first 100 days of President Trump's second term.",
      "\"In line with the secretary's vision to make this the most transparent Department of Defense in history, I gave you my personal commitment to make these briefings more routine,\" said top Pentagon public affairs aide Sean Parnell on March 17, during the only formal briefing conducted so far.",
      "During the same period, the White House and State Department have held 18 and 13 briefings, respectively, as of April 28.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Pentagon had 34 on-camera briefings in its first 100 days while Biden's White House and State Department held 61 and 34 briefings, respectively. During the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's first term, reporters received five on-camera briefings from the Defense Department.",
      "The Pentagon has a long history of briefing the media about military operations. Until his departure in 1968, Barry Zorthian would climb to the rooftop of Saigon's Rex Hotel to give reporters the Pentagon's official version of the Vietnam War. The briefings were branded the \"Five O'Clock Follies\" by skeptical reporters, but even so, the dialogue between spokesperson and journalist provided a critical stream of information about what the government was doing on behalf of American citizens.",
      "The tradition stretched across wars \u2014 from Desert Storm in 1991 to the 1999 Kosovo air campaign \u2014\u00a0 and even during the Biden administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Pentagon continued to brief the press regularly.",
      "Retired Rear Adm. T. McCreary, who ran the Navy's public affairs office as the chief of naval information from 2003 to 2006, told CBS News there are three reasons to hold news briefings: To get your story out first, so the public reacts to you; second, to stop the spread of the enemy putting out disinformation to spin the story; and third, to inform the taxpayers what the Pentagon, which has the largest discretionary budget of any department, is doing with its money.",
      "\"Every time the Pentagon and the [Defense Department] establishments start being less forthcoming with information, it erodes the trust and transparency that was built up over years to where the faith and the establishment sometimes starts getting questioned,\" McCreary said.",
      "The Office of the Secretary of Defense's Principles of Information details the Pentagon's guidelines for public affairs. Included is the promise to \"make available timely and accurate information so that the public, the Congress, and the news media may assess and understand the facts about national security and defense strategy.\"",
      "The single on-camera briefing the Pentagon held 43 days ago took place in the days after U.S. Central Command launched the ongoing campaign against the Houthis. Parnell, the chief spokesperson, and the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich answered questions on the operation.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has held news conferences and short question and answer sessions with a small group of reporters while traveling but has not yet conducted an on-camera briefing in the Pentagon Briefing Room, which accommodates about 60 reporters. He has, however, used the briefing room on at least four separate occasions as a backdrop for live interviews with Fox News.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. Central Command issued a press release boasting of hundreds of enemy fighters killed and dozens of command and storage centers destroyed under Operation Rough Rider. The targets, officials said, included advanced missiles, drones, and vessels used in Houthi attacks on commercial shipping lanes\u2014claims offered with little public scrutiny and even fewer questions answered as the total cost of the campaign nears $1 billion, CNN reported.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Pentagon and U.S. Central Command with questions on Monday, but neither one has responded.",
      "Soon after the campaign against the Houthis began, Hegseth was embroiled in controversy over sensitive details he shared over Signal on March 15 ahead of the initial strikes.",
      "Hegseth has denied sending any classified information, but over a month later, his use of Signal is still under scrutiny, following the revelation that he shared similar updates in a second chat that included his wife, brother and personal attorney.",
      "In that same month, five officials in Hegseth's inner circle have either been fired or left their positions, including John Ullyot, who briefly served as Pentagon Press Secretary and wrote an op-ed after his departure claiming there is \"total chaos\" at the Pentagon.",
      "Hegseth and Parnell, the chief spokesperson, have both denied these claims and have on social media blamed the stories on the media and disgruntled employees, but they have not briefed journalists to address questions.",
      "\"I think the administration would like to talk about something besides Signal, but the problem is they keep screwing it up,\" a former senior defense official told CBS News. \"You know the first thing about being in a bad news cycle is to stop creating news.\"",
      "During the Biden administration, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in the aftermath of his hospitalization scandal, took questions from the podium in the Pentagon press briefing room. For about 40 minutes, he answered questions and apologized for not disclosing his hospitalization and cancer diagnosis.",

      "\"The American public has a right to know how and why taxpayer dollars are spent, how those in uniform are faring and, within the boundaries of operational security, the dangers our troops and nation face\u2026this is not a partisan issue,\" he said. \"It is an American one. A well-informed public is a cornerstone of our democracy.\"",
      "Parnell has been going to X to provide weekly situation reports \u2014 or sitreps \u2014 where he talks straight to the camera about Pentagon updates as part of the administration's promise of transparency. The videos released each week do not provide the opportunity for the media to ask questions.",
      "Instead of regular press engagements, the Pentagon in February created DOD Rapid Response, a social media account on X. The account's bio states it is \"Supporting The Mission of SecDef [Hegseth] And Fighting Against Fake News!\"",
      "The account commonly attacks news publications and\u00a0 posts comments criticizing reporting about Hegseth and the Defense Department. The X account has omitted context from its statements, touting an increase in U.S. military recruiting numbers between February 2024 through February 2025, even though much of the credit for improved recruitment numbers belongs to Biden administration, as CBS News' Confirmed team found.",
      "The account also posted misleading statements about the Signal chat scandal reported by The Atlantic. The account is overseen by conservative podcaster and Army veteran Graham Allen, who is now the Pentagon's digital media director.",
      "\"Holding your policies up to the light of media scrutiny is a good, healthy thing,\" a second former senior defense official said. \"Over time, that scrutiny is very good for the policymaking process because reporters are going to think of things, and they're going to approach the way to ask questions in ways that the policy thinkers and the policy makers may not have done.\"",

      "Life expectancy nationwide increased far more for men from 1900 to 2000 than it did for women, a pattern that held true in a number of individual states. Overall, women's life expectancy by birth cohort grew from 73.8 to 84.1 years, while men's rose from 62.8 to 80.3 years.",

      "For women, the study found that life expectancy changed very little for those born in 1900 and those born in 2000 in five states: West Virginia, up from 74.3 to 75.3; Oklahoma, which saw a decrease from 76.7 to 76; Kentucky, up from 74.9 to 76.5; Mississippi, up from 73.2 to 76.6; and Arkansas, where it rose from 75.7 to 76.6.",
      "For men, Mississippi, West Virginia, Alabama, Louisiana and Tennessee saw the lowest changes in life expectancy compared with the rest of the country. In each, men born in 1900 had a life expectancy of between 61.5 and 63.7 years, while those born in 2000 have a life expectancy between 71.8 and 73.4 years.",
      "Like the lowest-ranking states, those with the highest life expectancy, and the most significant jumps in longevity over the last century, overlapped between women and men.",
      "For women, the study found life expectancy rates were highest and most improved for those born in Washington, D.C., New York, California, Massachusetts and Hawaii. New York, California, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts and Washington state topped the list for men.",
      "Why do people live longer in some states and not others?",
      "Authors of the study attributed the country's overall decrease in mortality rates to national improvements in sanitation, tobacco policies and health care, specifically calling out the progress made in terms of preventing cardiovascular disease, cancer and other illnesses since 1900. They cited variations in state public health policies between individual states to potentially explain the regional discrepancies indicated in the study, which also mentioned widening longevity gaps from the 1980s onward.",
      "\"These are undoubtedly shaped by state-level policies: states with progressive public health policies were more likely to experience increases in life expectancy than states without such policies,\" the authors wrote, adding that \"differences in mortality rates are also observed even at more granular levels by county.\"",
      "Socioeconomic factors play a significant role in the differences between health environments by state, the study noted, echoing findings of other reports on longevity in the U.S. Last year, a study that examined death records from 2000 to 2021 pinpointed large disparities in life expectancy based on location, as well as race and ethnicity.",
      "Accounting for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors of that study found that historically marginalized populations, including Black and Indigenous Americans, experienced disproportionately high mortality rates and \"horrific losses in life expectancy\" compared with other groups.",

    "story": [
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, citing a report that Amazon plans to display tariff charges on imported goods, called the move \"a hostile and political act.\"",
      "The e-commerce giant plans to display new tariff costs next to products' prices, political news site Punchbowl\u00a0reported earlier Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. The move would provide shoppers with clarity into the cost of the new levies on imported goods.",
      "\"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\" Leavitt said during a press briefing Tuesday.",
      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",
      "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" said Tim Doyle, an Amazon spokesperson.",

      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",
      "Earlier this month, data showed that\u00a0Amazon sellers had already hiked prices on nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%.",
      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "Investigators say the suspicious timing of doing a load of laundry and a call to 911 focused their attention on a former state trooper and his potential role in his wife's death.",
    "story": [
      "When former Idaho State Trooper Dan Howard called 911 from his home in Athol, Idaho, on the night of Feb. 2, 2021, he was crying so much that it was hard to understand what he was saying.",
      "\"My wife ... she shot herself,\" Dan Howard told the operator. \"She's in the bathtub dead ... I go upstairs and she's dead. She's dead ... she's gray, she has no pulse, nothing ... she's cold.\"",
      "Dan Howard later told authorities that he had been downstairs and heard something hitting the floor upstairs. Dan Howard said that when he went upstairs over an hour later, he found his wife of 26 years, Kendy Howard, in a bathtub filled with water with a gunshot wound to her head.",
      "The case \u2014 starting from the hours after Kendy's death to a surprising final twist \u2014 is investigated by \"48 Hours\" and correspondent Peter Van Sant in \"The Bathtub Murder of Kendy Howard.\"\u00a0An encore of the broadcast airs Saturday, May 3 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Kootenai County Sheriff's Deputy Miranda Thomas was one of the first responders to arrive at the Howards' home that night. Thomas later described how Dan Howard was \"screaming, yelling, asking us for help ... sobbing, gagging, just overall kind of freaking out.\"",
      "Also on the scene that night was Kootenai County Sheriff's Detective Jerry Northrup. Northrup confirmed the 911 call was dispatched as a suicide, but recounts that it did not take long for his team to grow suspicious.",
      "\"For a woman to shoot herself in the tub, nude, is unusual,\" said Northrup. \"It doesn't mean it can't happen \u2014 it just means that it's unusual.\"",
      "There was also other evidence at the scene that stuck out to investigators. According to Northrup, there was broken glass found in the primary bedroom, and Kendy Howard's clothing thrown on the floor. There were wet towels behind the bathroom door, and when investigators first arrived at the scene, they reported that the water in the tub was still warm to the touch. Thomas noticed a packed duffle bag filled with women's clothing lay at the bottom of the stairs, and that the shirt Dan Howard was wearing seemed to have fresh deodorant stains.",
      "One of the more intriguing clues, say investigators, was a load of laundry mid-cycle in the dryer. Thomas took note: \"A washer or dryer doesn't run for very long, 45 minutes, maybe an hour, so when was this washer and dryer started?\"",
      "Northrup had the same thought and recorded the time left on the dryer cycle: six minutes. He told Van Sant how he pulled up the cycle running times from the manufacturer's website and compared the information against the time at which the 911 call was placed.",
      "Northrup determined that the dryer cycle would have started at 10:42 p.m. and the 911 call came in at 10:43 p.m. Meaning, says Northrup, Howard started the laundry cycle about a minute before calling 911. But why?",
      "Investigators continued digging, and after reviewing the evidence with medical and scientific experts, came up with a theory as to how Dan Howard could have killed his wife.",
      "Dan Howard was arrested in April 2023, and in March 2024, went on trial for the murder of his wife.",

    "summary": "A ruling by the Supreme Court in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would lead to the country's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday is set to hear arguments in a high-profile dispute over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "A decision follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions. But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing. \"",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Just eight justices will hear arguments in the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett has recused herself. Though she did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",
      "Because of Barrett's recusal, the Supreme Court could deadlock 4-4. That result would leave in place the ruling from the Oklahoma Supreme Court that found the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic public charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly four months into 2025, the United States recorded the most measles cases in a single year since a 2019 wave, and the number continues to grow, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to more than\u00a0660, while cases nationwide topped 880, with infections confirmed in at least 29 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, but cases have been reported in other states around the country, as well.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Fridays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",

    "story": [
      "At age 90, Ren\u00e9e Richards plays a lot of golf.",
      "\"Yesterday I played 18 holes. I'm going to play 18 holes in my league today, and if I feel okay, I'll play 18 holes tomorrow,\" said Richards recently.",
      "The former professional tennis player and ophthalmologist made headlines in the 1970s, when after transitioning to female she sued and won the right to play in the U.S. Open. During her half-decade pro career, Richards peaked at 20th in the world and in 1977 made the U.S. open finals in doubles, where she lost to a pair that included tennis legend Martina Navratilova.",
      "Half a century later, her views have evolved \u2014 she believes transgender women who transition after puberty should not compete in women's sports \u2014 but she's aghast at broader restrictions on transgender rights during the Trump administration's first 100 days.",
      "The State Department has halted the practice of issuing passports with \"X\" gender markers. The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip \"gender ideology\" from websites, contracts and emails. An executive order calls on the federal government \"to rescind all funds from educational programs\" that allow transgender girls and women to compete. Another order restricts access to gender-affirming care\u00a0for youth. The Department of Defense has reinstated President Trump's first term transgender military ban, and transgender federal inmates are now regarded by their sex at birth. The changes are the subject of ongoing lawsuits.",
      "First and foremost on Richards' mind: the Navy veteran believes transgender Americans should be able to serve openly in the military.",
      "\"That's terrible. You know, I can only think of myself because I was in the Navy when nobody knew that I was a transgender. I hadn't had surgery yet, but it was still me,\" said Richards, who won the All-Navy tennis championship while serving. \"That goes a long way back, but I'm still representative of the same ilk even though they didn't know it at the time.\"",
      "Richards is the subject of a forthcoming book, tentatively titled \"Finding Ren\u00e9e,\" by former Sports Illustrated editor Julie Kliegman. Richards believes the fierce debate over transgender athletes has fueled a \"jump\u2026from the sports to the military, to the education, to the bathrooms, to the passports, to the existence, to the teaching of any kind of gender.\"",
      "It's a trend that has played out in state legislatures, before and during the current Trump administration, according to Logan Casey, the director of policy research at the nonprofit Movement Advancement Project, which tracks state laws and executive orders regulating gender.",
      "Casey said state-level bans on sports prior to the current Trump administration \"laid the groundwork for all of the anti-transgender and anti-LGBTQ attacks more broadly.\"",
      "\"It sort of put sports as a foot in the door, and a framework, for how many people who had not previously thought about transgender people very much \u2014 let alone in the context of policy and law \u2014 are now thinking about it and framing it,\" said Casey, who noted the vast majority of state legislation targeting LGBTQ rights fails to become law.",
      "Ash Lazarus Orr, a spokesperson for Advocates for Trans Equality, said the language of Mr. Trump's executive orders bore similarities to orders and legislation coming out of state capitals.",
      "\"It signals back to states that, yes, this is a priority. You should continue to do this, and in fact do this and other attacks,\" said Orr, who is also the title plaintiff in a lawsuit over the Trump administration's policy requiring U.S. passports to reflect sex assigned at birth. \"While we were seeing attacks on the trans community escalating at a state level under the Biden administration, what we are seeing now under the Trump administration is absolutely an escalation.\"",
      "Former Olympic swimmer Nancy Hogshead, a Democrat who founded the nonprofit advocacy group Champion Women, believes the party is suffering from self-inflicted wounds.",
      "Hogshead, who supports efforts to align participation in sports with gender at birth, said Trump and Republicans have found a galvanizing issue.",
      "\"It is a winner for them. It is a winner for Republicans,\" Hogshead said. \"Fifty percent of all girls play sports. That is a meat and potatoes issue for them. It's not a fringe issue.\"",
      "Richards believes Trump has a similar view. She said, as an ophthalmologist, she treated one of his sisters and has met Mr. Trump once.",
      "\"He knows I'm not an ogre,\" she said. \"He sees, and his advisors advise him, that his popularity rests with the small group of people that hate the idea of transgender, period.\"",
      "Richards, whose professional tennis career began in 1977 when she was more than 40 years old, largely agrees with Hogshead. In April 2024, she provided the Women's Tennis Association with a position paper on participation of transgender women in sports, and this year allowed Sports Illustrated to publish it. In the paper, Richards concluded that people who have undergone male puberty should be ineligible to compete against biological females.",
      "Richards's paper included reflections on her time playing both as an amateur and professionally, analysis of \"the current literature on the subject,\" citing her decades as a doctor, and policy recommendations.",
      "It also touched on golf.",
      "\"My lifetime in sports is still ongoing,\" she wrote. \"I have been a member of the ladies' golf league at the public/private club near my home for the past 20 years.\"",
      "Richards spoke to CBS News on opening day last week. She said, despite politics, the women in her league still welcome her competition.",
      "\"Not only welcome and accepted, but if I didn't show up, they would have a cemetery ceremony, believe me,\" Richards said.",
      "Are there a lot of 90-year-olds there, still hitting the links?",
      "\"Yeah, me. Amongst the men and the women, I'm the only one,\" Richards said, adding that she guesses the average age at the club is 60. \"I play the forward tee, but I don't play any gold tees that are in front of that \u2014 and I hit the ball as well as they do, too.\"",

      "Last week, the Coast Guard cutter Kimball offloaded approximately 18,898 pounds of cocaine \u2014 with an estimated street value of more than $214 million \u2014 in San Diego, after intercepting six trafficking vessels off the coasts of Mexico and Central America and South America between February and April,\u00a0federal officials said. Two weeks earlier, CBS Miami reported\u00a0that another pair of Coast Guard cutters, James and Mohawk, offloaded more than 48,000 pounds of seized illegal drugs valued at more than $509 million at Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale.",
      "That offload in Florida came from 13 separate incidents where Coast Guard ships intercepted drug trafficking operations in the eastern Pacific Ocean. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said at the time that the hauls included almost 45,000 pounds of \"pure cocaine\" and another 3,800 pounds of marijuana.",
      "Earlier this year, the Coast Guard cutter Waesche offloaded more than 37,000 pounds of cocaine seized from smuggling boats off the coasts of Mexico, Central America and South America between December and February. The cutter ship intercepted 11 vessels in that time period, the Coast Guard said, and the haul altogether was valued at more than $275 million.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 10:09:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As President Trump marks his first 100 days in the White House, many of the plans he has rolled out since the start of his second term closely align with those detailed in Project 2025's sprawling policy book.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, saying he had \"nothing to do with\" the initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, had not read it and didn't have any plans to.",
      "But as the president marks 100 days in the White House, many of the plans he has rolled out since the start of his second term closely align with those in the pages of Project 2025's sprawling, 900-page policy blueprint, which lays out an overhaul of the executive branch.",
      "Overseen by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was an initiative that was designed to provide a roadmap for the next Republican president, now Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, the president called some of its proposals \"abysmal\" and said he knew nothing about it, though CBS News' analysis showed many of its proposals were similar to his own.",
      "The authors of some of the policy guide's chapters served in his first administration and have returned for the second. Russ Vought is leading the Office of Management and Budget, and John Ratcliffe is in place as CIA director, while Peter Navarro, who was a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump in his first administration, returned for a second stint in the White House.",
      "Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances, Mr. Trump has taken new executive actions that echo policies outlined in Project 2025's policy book.",
      "Abolishing the Department of Education",
      "Republicans have long called for the Department of Education to be dismantled, and that recommendation was also made in Project 2025, which declared that \"federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Department of Education should be eliminated.\"",
      "Mr. Trump took steps to begin that process with an executive order he signed in March. The administration has already cut the Education Department's staff and is making plans to move some of its functions to other agencies.",
      "Shuttering the Department of Education, however, would require an act of Congress.",
      "Ending diversity, equity and inclusion practices",
      "The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and he signed an executive order on the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government.",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex.",
      "Project 2025 likewise calls for the \"DEI apparatus\" at a variety of agencies to be dismantled.",
      "Project 2025's policy book also calls for deleting a variety of terms, including DEI, abortion and gender equality \"from every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\"",
      "Some of the Trump administration's early efforts to purge mentions of gender or race resulted in missteps that prompted a public outcry and were later reversed.",
      "Shifting FEMA costs to the states",
      "Shortly after the start of his second term, Mr. Trump established a review council to advise him on the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, \"to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States.\" The council will also advise the president on recommended changes related to FEMA, his order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive came after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states.",
      "\"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" he said in late January.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that declares it is the policy of the U.S. that \"state and local governments and individuals play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness,\" and says that his administration will \"enable state and local governments to better understand, plan for and ultimately address the needs of their citizens.\"",
      "The overhaul at FEMA has sparked concerns about the agency's capabilities to deliver disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. FEMA has already denied requests for federal aid in response to severe storms and tornadoes\u00a0in Arkansas, flooding in parts of\u00a0West Virginia and storms\u00a0in Washington.",
      "Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\"",
      "It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a 2023 report from the Congressional Research Service.",
      "The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities.",
      "\"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states.",
      "Targeting PBS and National Public Radio",
      "Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, informed the heads of National Public Radio and PBS in a letter earlier this year that the agency had opened an investigation into the airing of their programming across their roughly 1,500 broadcast member stations, according to The New York Times.",
      "Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from airing commercial advertisements.",
      "In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\"",
      "Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\" PBS CEO Paula Kerger said the cuts \"would devastate PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations.\"",
      "Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC, but another portion of the blueprint urges Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to NPR and PBS.",
      "According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book.",
      "Freezing federal assistance",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the White House's Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 DOGE \u2014 run by Elon Musk, to slash regulations and spending, and restructure federal agencies.",
      "On the heels of that move, the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo in January that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs covered by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\"",
      "The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children, medical research and other priorities approved by Congress would be impacted by the order.",
      "The White House then rescinded the memo but maintained the funding pause \"to end any confusion\" created by a federal court order temporarily pausing implementation of the freeze. Federal courts have since ordered the administration to reinstate any money that was frozen subject to the memo.",
      "Vought, the head of OMB, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead.",
      "In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\"",
      "The memo may have been aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation.",
      "In Project 2025's policy blueprint, Vought also wrote the director of OMB must have \"sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making,\" and can achieve this by ensuring political appointees on his staff sign off on apportionments of funding authorized by Congress.",
      "Vought cited a 1870 law known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance and requires funding be doled out in installments.",
      "\"This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars,\" he wrote. \"OMB can then direct on behalf of a president the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the president's agenda and applicable laws.\"",
      "Restricting gender-affirming care for minors",
      "Mr. Trump issued an executive order in January that seeks to bar the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care \u2014 puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures \u2014 for people under the age of 19.",
      "Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the order directs certain executive agencies to take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\"",
      "It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs.",
      "Mr. Trump's order directs the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw March 2022 guidance on gender-affirming care.",
      "Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document.",
      "The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it.",
      "Many families and doctors who care for transgender youth dispute that assessment, and a group of families filed a lawsuit claiming the order is discriminatory. Two different federal district courts have blocked the president's directive, and those injunctions are being appealed.",
      "Revoking security clearances",
      "Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process of revoking the security clearances of dozens of former intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign. He also announced he would revoke the security clearances of a number of prominent Democrats including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton.",
      "Project 2025 also proposed stripping former intelligence officials of security clearances, under a more narrow set of circumstances, in a section on the intelligence community authored by Dustin Carmack, who worked at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "\"The president should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director,\" he wrote.",
      "Stripping civil servants of employment protections",
      "Among the slew of actions Mr. Trump took on his first day back in the White House was to reinstate an executive order issued during his first term that created \"Schedule F in the Excepted Service.\" The order creates a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of employment protections.",
      "The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\"",
      "\"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads.",
      "The order makes some minor changes to the president's prior measure from October 2020. But it notably adds a section that states that while employees in these new \"Schedule Policy/Career Positions,\" are not required to personally or politically support the current president or his policies, they are \"required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the president.\"",
      "Failure to do so is grounds for termination of employment, Mr. Trump's executive order states. Critics say the change would enable the administration to fire government employees for no cause and replace them with Trump loyalists.",
      "Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated.",
      "Reinstating service members who refused COVID-19 vaccines",
      "The president directed the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security to reinstate service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. (The vaccine requirement was lifted in 2023.) His order also states they should be reverted to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments or compensation.",
      "The Project 2025 blueprint's section on the Defense Department, authored by Chris Miller, calls for the next administration to \"reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\"",
      "Miller served as acting defense secretary in the final weeks of Mr. Trump's first term. His chief of staff, Kash Patel, is now serving as director of the FBI.",
      "Banning transgender people from the military",
      "During his first four years in the White House, Mr. Trump prohibited transgender people from serving in the military. President Biden repealed that ban, but Mr. Trump has issued an order that effectively bars transgender people from serving in the armed forces and withdraws his predecessor's order.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\" Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\"",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\"",
      "Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service.\"",
      "SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit group comprising thousands of transgender service members, veterans and their supporters, disputed such claims, saying: \"Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve.\"",
      "The transgender military ban has since been blocked by two different federal courts, though the decisions have been appealed. The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in one of those cases and is seeking to begin enforcing the ban.",
      "There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department. A January report from the Congressional Research Service found that roughly 1,892 active-duty service members received gender-affirming care from the Pentagon between January 2016 and May 2021. A Feb. 26 memo from the Pentagon found that between 2015 and 2024, it spent $52 million on care for active-duty members of the military to treat gender dysphoria.",
      "A hiring freeze",
      "On his first day in the White House, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum freezing hiring of federal civilian employees, which he extended to July 15. Positions that were vacant as of his inauguration at noon on Jan. 20 should also not be filled, he said.",
      "The order was part of his plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, also a recommendation made in the Project 2025 policy roadmap.",
      "The book, though, warns that while \"reducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service,\" prior attempts to do so by presidents of both parties \"did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\"",
      "Instead, Project 2025 suggests a \"freeze on all top career-position hiring to prevent 'burrowing-in' by outgoing political appointees.\"",
      "Withdrawing from World Health Organization",
      "Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in 2020 due to what his first administration said was a mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden reversed that decision when he took office, and Mr. Trump rolled back that move on his first day back in the White House.",
      "His latest order directed the secretary of state to inform the secretary-general of the United States and World Health Organization leadership of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the group. Health officials in the U.S. and around the world have warned the move will leave people at greater risk of dangerous outbreaks and give China a more dominant role at the World Health Organization.",
      "Project 2025, too, criticized the World Health Organization for its handling of the pandemic.",
      "\"The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests,\" its book states.",
      "It said that when institutions act contrary to U.S. interests, the government \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response, up to and including withdrawal.\"",
      "Sending active-duty troops to the southern border",
      "Immigration was the topic of several executive actions taken by Mr. Trump on the first day of his presidency, including one order that assigns troops \"the mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the United States.\"",
      "The chapter of Project 2025's blueprint that covers the Department of Homeland Security was authored by Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration, and it, too, sees a role for the Defense Department in securing the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The Pentagon, Cucinelli writes, should \"explicitly acknowledge and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border traffic to legal ports of entry.\"",
      "A section on the Justice Department urges the next administration to \"take a creative and aggressive approach\" to tackling criminal organizations at the southern border.",
      "\"This could include use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border \u2014 something that has not yet been done,\" Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department states.",
      "Limiting refugee admissions",
      "Entry into the U.S. by refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was suspended earlier this year in accordance with an order by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20. His directive also orders the secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on applications for refugee status.",
      "Mr. Trump has claimed that during the Biden administration, the U.S. has been \"inundated\" with high levels of migration, including through the Refugee Admissions Program.",
      "Project 2025, too, blames the Biden administration for overseeing what it says was a \"collapse\" of U.S. border security and immigration enforcement. To address this \"crisis,\" Project 2025 calls for \"rightsizing refugee admissions.\"",
      "\"The federal government's obligation to shift national security\u2013essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions,\" its chapter on the State Department reads.",
      "The policy book calls for the State Department bureau that administers the Refugee Admissions Program to shift resources to challenges \"until the crisis can be contained and refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored.\"",
      "Rescinding temporary protected status designations",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, his administration has moved to end the Temporary Protected Status program for Haitians and Venezuelans.",
      "The TPS designation was created by Congress in 1990, and it allows the federal government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "A federal judge in late March agreed to delay the Trump administration's attempt to end the TPS program that shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, and a federal appeals court declined to pause that order while proceedings continue.",
      "Project 2025 calls on Congress to \"repeal temporary protected status designations.\"",
      "Capping indirect costs for university-based research",
      "The National Institutes of Health announced in a February memo that it would be capping the amount of funding for \"indirect costs\" at 15%, a cut from an average of between 27% and 28%. Indirect costs cover general expenses like facilities and administration.",
      "NIH said in its memo that it has spent billions on indirect costs for more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions across the country, and noted that \"most private foundations that fund research provide substantially lower indirect costs than the federal government, and universities readily accept grants from these foundations.\"",
      "Project 2025 also focused on indirect costs and called on Congress to \"cap the indirect cost rate paid to universities so that it does not exceed the lowest rate a university accepts from a private organization to fund search efforts.\"",
      "\"This market-based reform would help reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,\" the policy book read.",
      "While Project 2025 said it is up to Congress to cap the indirect cost rate, the Trump administration took this step unilaterally, prompting legal challenges from universities, states and organizations that represent medical colleges and schools.",
      "Universities and the NIH said the cuts will have a \"dire impact\" on lifesaving research, including clinical trials for cancer and Alzheimer's patients.",
      "Requiring disclosures of foreign gifts to universities",
      "As part of a series of executive orders addressing the education system, Mr. Trump issued a directive on April 23 that directs the education secretary to enforce a provision of the Higher Education Act that requires higher education institutions that receive federal dollars to disclose any gifts of contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year.",
      "The move is also part of Project 2025, which calls on the next administration to enforce that statute, investigate higher education institutions that do not honor the obligations laid out in the law and make \"appropriate referrals\" to the Justice Department.",
      "Asserting the president's power to remove federal officials",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to fire the members of independent agencies and inspectors general, despite federal laws that lay out the grounds for their removals.",
      "The terminations have sparked multiple court fights that appear aimed at asserting what the Trump administration believes is the president's unrestricted power to remove executive branch officials. But a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "In a February letter to Congress, then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department \"intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions.\"",
      "Project 2025, too, suggested the next Republican presidential administration should seek the reversal of Humphrey's Executor.",
      "\"The next conservative administration should formally take the position that Humphrey's Executor violates the Constitution's separation of powers,\" it states.",
      "Targeting NOAA",
      "Project 2025's policy book calls for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, to be \"dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.\"",
      "The guide says NOAA's six main components should either be downsized or broken up, including Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, or OAR, which Project 2025 claims is the \"source of much of NOAA's climate alarmism.\"",
      "The Trump administration has proposed sweeping changes and job cuts for NOAA, including a 25% cut to its 2026 budget, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The proposal calls for OAR to be eliminated as an office, as well as funding for climate, weather and ocean laboratories, cooperative institutes and other programs.",
      "Current and former officials with NOAA have said the memo's objectives are \"devastating,\" and have argued that research is crucial to improving services such as severe weather forecasts\u00a0for the public.",

    "story": [
      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories. Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "But even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent about $220 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",
      "Musk recently said his work with DOGE is winding down.",
      "Explore the spending details yourself",
      "You can explore the government's daily account ledgers for yourself. We've isolated the money spent by category in the first few months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period in each of the last 10 years.",
      "You can search for agencies or spending categories below to see the change over time and how much or less is being spent during this first 100 days of the Trump administration. We've limited the table to agencies and categories with at least $100 million in spending since Jan. 20, 2025.",

      "U.S. retailers had rushed to import goods into the country ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariffs going into effect, leading to a spike in imports since last summer.

      "\"This dramatic drop aligned with two key developments: the April 4th U.S. tariff announcement, followed by China's retaliatory measures announced on April 5th. The result? A widespread booking freeze, as shippers paused mid-shipment cycle to reassess costs, timelines and broader trade strategy,\" Vizion said in a report.",
      "Freightos, a freight booking platform, notes that carriers are canceling sailings from China at a fast clip, because they can't fill their ships with goods. Ocean container prices have dropped from $8,100 in July 2024 for a standard 40-foot container, to roughly, $2,327, the group noted.",

      "Such concerns come as the White House makes a sharp break with the country's traditional playbook on global trade. The result, say critics, includes the highest tariffs in more than a century; sudden, confusing\u00a0shifts in tariff policy\u00a0and major damage to the U.S.' geopolitical relationships.",
      "\"Tariffs have been an unmitigated disaster, economically,\" former Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican and erstwhile economics professor at Texas A&M University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There's no doubt about it that the tariff policy in and of itself will drive up prices because tariffs are a tax. And remember, 61% of imports are component parts to be used in the production of goods and services in America.\"",
      "Gramm added, \"I want to emphasize that the harm of tariffs isn't just inflation \u2014 it's what they do for efficiency and economic growth.\"",
      "The Trump administration stands by its economic record to date, with White House spokesman Kush Deai saying in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that \"President Trump's America First policies are delivering much-needed economic relief for everyday Americans while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness.\"",
      "\"Within 100 days of President Trump's second term in office, Americans saw the first monthly price drop in years in the March inflation report, while industry leaders ranging from Apple to Hyundai to Nvidia have made trillions in historic investment commitments to reshore manufacturing back to the United States,\" Desai added. \"President Trump delivered a historic economy in his first term, and he's running back the success in his second term.\"",
      "Economic slowdown",
      "Already, the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing. Business surveys in April suggest the U.S. is headed for \"a sluggish pace of growth,\" according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, which pointed to what it calls an \"an existential crisis\" for businesses, created by Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The country's gross domestic product \u2014 the total annual value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S. \u2014 is forecast to slow to 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, a sharp decline from 2.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, according to economists polled by financial services firm FactSet. For the year, economic growth is predicted to slow to 1.9%, versus 2.8% in 2024, FactSet data shows.",
      "Economists warn that the U.S. could slip into a recession due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists largely gave the U.S. economy a good rating, pointing to its strong growth, low unemployment and progress in bringing inflation under control.",
      "Businesses large and small say the tariffs will cause disruptions, with almost 900 companies in the last 30 days alone citing the barrage of new U.S. levies in their earnings calls. That compares with 100 mentions in December 2024, according to transcripts posted by FactSet. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Walmart and Target\u00a0privately warned Mr. Trump that the tariffs could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves within weeks.",
      "\"Most businesses plan to pass these costs on to their consumers, which will make things more expensive, and we're going to see cuts in consumer spending as a result,\" Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics said, adding that her firm isn't forecasting a recession although it has pared its GDP outlook. \"That's less revenue for businesses.\"",
      "Inflation fears flare",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" vowing that if he would bring down prices \"very quickly\" in a second term.",
      "But 100 days into his new administration, consumers are skeptical about Mr. Trump's vow to tackle inflation, with 63% telling CBS News in new polling that they believed his policies would cause grocery prices to go up. Only 15% said they believe his administration will help lower their grocery bills.",
      "Consumers are clearly worried about tariffs, with the same CBS News poll finding that 55% of respondents said Mr. Trump doesn't have a clear plan for tariffs and trade. Americans now expect inflation to rise to 6.5% a year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index \u2014 a potentially self-fulling outlook that could cause consumers to pull back on spending.",
      "So far, however, inflation data shows that price increases eased to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February. Falling gas prices have come as a relief for motorists, with the national average for a gallon of regular gas now at $3.17, compared with $3.66 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "Still, many economists forecasts that inflation will pick up later this year as the impact of tariffs works its way through the economy.",
      "The case for tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that his tariff policies will benefit the U.S. economy over the long term. In his view, the cost of the tariffs will spur both U.S. and foreign businesses to expand in the U.S., spawning jobs for American workers and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, some businesses have said they are investing in domestic manufacturing, with Apple planning a $500 billion expansion of its U.S. facilities over four years and IBM on Monday announcing a $150 billion investment to \"fuel the economy.\"",
      "The president also maintains that tariffs will bring in trillions in new federal revenue , helping to offset an extension of his 2017 tax cuts currently being hammered out by Republican lawmakers. But many economists are skeptical that his tariffs could bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods\u00a0when their prices rise.",
      "\"Consumers have to be confident to affect their spending,\" noted Donald Boudreaux, an economist at George Mason University (whose book with Sen. Gramm, \"The Triumph of Economic Freedom: Debunking the Seven Great Myths of American Capitalism,\" will be published next month). \"The current policy is reducing their confidence.\"",
      "For his part, Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the impact of U.S. tariffs will cause \"some pain\" for Americans, while adding in a February social media post that \"IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\"",
      "Market turmoil",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the Trump administration's economic policies has been clear: The S&P 500 index has lost 10% of its value since reaching a post-inauguration high on February 19, putting the broad-based market into correction territory.",
      "The dollar has lost about 9% of its value since Mr. Trump's inauguration, according to the U.S. dollar index, which compares the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies. Typically, investors rush to the bond market in times of economic uncertainty, but in recent weeks\u00a0bond prices have slid and yields have risen \u2014\u00a0 signs investors are rattled by the impact of Trump administration policies.",
      "\"I would emphasize that this movement in the asset markets is indeed unusual, and it happened particularly after April 2, 'Liberation Day',\" or the day when Mr. Trump announced tariffs on almost every nation on Earth, Boudreaux said. \"It can only be explained by global investor fears of what might happen in the U.S. economy.\"",
      "He added, \"It's too soon to tell how far those fears will go, but the early signs aren't cheery.\"",
      "A boost from tax cuts and deregulation?",
      "To be sure, mounting anxieties among consumers, businesses and investors don't by themselves herald an inevitable economic downturn. And so far, the economy remains resilient, with unemployment near a 50-year low and inflation edging down to 2.4% in March.",
      "Some economists also point to what they view as positives in Mr. Trump's agenda, such as prospects for tax cuts and deregulation, which could spur economic growth. And Mr. Trump has touted his administration's efforts to slash federal spending, overseen by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as a win for taxpayers.",
      "\"We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Mr. Trump told Time Magazine in an interview this month.",
      "DOGE, by its account, has cut about $160 billion in costs, or about 2.4% of the federal government's roughly $6.8 trillion in annual spending. But some critics have pointed out that the cuts will ultimately cost taxpayers\u00a0due to rehiring federal workers who were mistakenly fired, lower productivity of remaining workers and through lower tax collections from the IRS, which is reducing its staffing under DOGE's direction.",
      "In the meantime, some observers say the biggest hurdle to Mr. Trump's economic goals is of his own creation.",
      "\"We want Trump to succeed \u2014 in criticizing this trading policy, it's the policy we're criticizing,\" Sen. Gramm said. \"I don't believe the president can achieve what he wants to achieve for America unless his trade policy changes.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:59:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Spain's prime minister said a special commission will track down the cause of a massive power outage and all \"necessary measures will be taken\" to stop it from recurring.",
    "story": [
      "Spain's government has set up a special commission to figure out what caused the massive power outage that hit virtually the entire country, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced Tuesday, stressing that no potential causes had been ruled out. He also joined the wider European Union in vowing that everything necessary would be done to prevent a recurrence of the electricity grid failure, which ground most of the Iberian Peninsula \u2014 composed of Spain and neighboring Portugal \u2014   to a halt and left people in the dark until Tuesday morning.",
      "\"All the necessary measures will be taken to ensure that this does not happen again,\" S\u00e1nchez said during a news conference in Madrid, just hours after the lights came back on.",
      "Monday's still-unexplained power outage was the most severe ever to hit Spain and Portugal, which have a combined population of around 60 million people. According to The Associated Press, Spain's roughly 49 million inhabitants saw their country's power generation drop by around 15 gigawatts \u2014   roughly 60% of the typical real-time demand in the nation \u2014 in the space of just five seconds, starting just after noon local time on Monday.",
      "Spanish power distributor Red El\u00e9ctrica said early Tuesday that about 99% of its power capacity had been restored, after many residents of both Spain's capital Madrid and Lisbon in neighboring Portugal went to sleep in total darkness.",
      "Offices across the Iberian Peninsula were closed and traffic was left in chaos on Monday. Airports, along with trains and subway systems, ground to a halt, ATMs ceased to function, and many mobile phone networks went down. Gas-powered generators and battery-powered radios flew off shelves.",
      "What caused the power outage in Spain and Portugal?",
      "S\u00e1nchez had said Monday that a problem in the wider European grid, which he called a \"strong oscillation,\" had been behind the outage, but that was never confirmed or expounded upon by the Spanish leader or the country's electricity providers, and officials subsequently asked people to refrain from speculation, stressing that nothing had been ruled out. On Tuesday, S\u00e1nchez did rule out one possible issue, saying there had been no lack of nuclear power generation capacity on Monday. About 20% of Spain's power comes from its nuclear plants.",
      "REN, Portugal's national electricity grid operator, said Monday there had been a rare atmospheric phenomenon in Spain, which it pinned on extreme temperature variations, but that explanation was also never confirmed, and on Tuesday, Spain's meteorological agency said it had not detected any \"unusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena\" or unexpectedly dramatic temperature fluctuations the previous day.",
      "Eduardo Prieto, who's in charge of operations for Spain's Red El\u00e9ctrica, said Monday that while the cause remained unclear, the power outage was unprecedented, \"exceptional and extraordinary.\"",
      "The company had said Monday that there was no indication of a cyberattack causing the outage, but S\u00e1nchez said the following day that a separate investigation would continue looking at the possibility.",
      "Antonio Costa, president of the EU's European Council, said Tuesday that there were \"no indications of any cyberattack.\" His colleague Teresa Ribera, one of the executive vice presidents of the European Commission, also seemed to rule out sabotage, but she called the blackout \"one of the most serious episodes recorded in Europe in recent times.\"",
      "The power outage was the second to hit Europe in just over a month. London's Heathrow Airport, one of Europe's busiest hubs, was shut down for most of March 20 after a local electricity substation went up in flames. The cause of that fire remains under investigation, but London's Metropolitan Police said it did not appear suspicious.",
      "While no officials have suggested that either the fire in London or the blackout on the Iberian Peninsula were the result of nefarious activity, they both came amid heightened concern over Russian sabotage operations targeting Western European nations that support Ukraine.",
      "A source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News in early November that U.S. and European law enforcement agencies were working together to investigate whether incendiary devices that detonated in July 2024 at DHL logistics hubs in Germany and Britain were part of a larger\u00a0operation directed by Russian military intelligence\u00a0agencies, senior officials in Russia's government, or by outside individuals acting in Russia's perceived interest.",
      "There have also been numerous incidents of undersea cables, mostly carrying power or telecommunications data, being severed or disrupted in recent years, often after Russian or Chinese-linked vessels were in the area.",
      "European officials have said such alleged sabotage actions are part of a Russian \"hybrid war\" against Ukraine's backers and its democratic adversaries in the West.",
      "Jovita Neliup\u0161ien\u0117, the European Union's ambassador to the United States, told CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" in November that Russian sabotage, along with the assassination of political foes not only in Russia, but on European soil, was part of President Vladimir Putin's bid to challenge \"the order, the stability of Europe, and actually testing\" the continent's will and capacity to respond to such operations.",
      "\"All those sabotage, cyber, or attacks on critical infrastructure is actually happening on EU and NATO territory. They are testing how much they ... can move.\"",

      "\"Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah. We condemn all attacks on civilians, always. It is never okay,\" the band said in a statement posted Monday  on social media.",

      "Speaking to reporters on Monday, the Republic of Ireland's leader Miche\u00e1l Martin said that support for Hamas or Hezbollah is \"unacceptable\" and asked Kneecap to urgently clarify their views. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that he condemned the group's remarks \"in the strongest possible terms.\"",
      "U.K. police also said they were reviewing video from a concert in 2023 in which one Kneecap member appears to call for killing Conservative party lawmakers, who are often known as Tories, by saying on stage: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.\"",
      "Those comments have been sharply criticized by the families of two British lawmakers who were murdered in recent years. The families of Conservative Member of Parliament David Amess, who was stabbed by an ISIS supporter in 2021, and Labour Party MP Jo Cox, who was shot and stabbed multiple times by a neo-Nazi sympathizer, called for a public apology from the group,",

    "summary": "Canadian Prime Minster Mark Carney's Liberal Party will retain its hold on power, in a reversal of fortunes seen largely as a reaction to Mr. Trump's actions and rhetoric.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's Liberal Party won Monday's federal election, marking a sharp political turnaround seemingly powered largely by the territorial threats and tariff tactics of President Trump.",
      "Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals were projected to win more of the Canadian Parliament's 343 seats than the rival Conservatives. It wasn't immediately clear if the Liberals would claim an outright majority of at least 172 seats, or if they'd be forced to rely on lawmakers from a smaller party or parties to get new legislation passed.",
      "Canadians decided with Monday's vote to grant the Liberal Party a fourth term in power, now with Carney at the helm, rather than to transfer control to the Conservatives and their populist leader Pierre Poilievre, who only months earlier had been projected to win the election decisively.",
      "The Liberal Party's popularity had been declining for years, eventually leading to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation in March, and the Conservatives appeared poised to take control of the federal government \u2014 until Mr. Trump stepped in.",
      "The American president's repeated\u00a0threats to annex Canada and his sweeping tariffs, which have undermined Canada's economy, dominated the campaign and influenced voters' choices. Domestic issues including affordability, immigration, jobs and crime remained significant factors.",
      "\"As I have been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never,\" declared Carney in a victory speech on Monday evening. \"These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Calling it a \"hinge moment\" in history, Carney said Canada's \"old relationship with the United States \u2014 a relationship based on steadily increasing integration \u2014 is over. The system of open global trade, anchored by the United States, a system that Canada has relied on since the Second World War, a system that, while not perfect, has helped deliver prosperity for our country for decades, is over. These are tragedies, but it's also our new reality... We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons. We have to look out for ourselves and, above all, we have to take care of each other.\"",
      "Poilievre, a seasoned politician for the Conservatives, lost his parliamentary seat in Ottawa, casting doubt on his continued leadership of the party. Monday's election marked a significant turn of events for the leader, who was first elected to the parliament in 2004.",
      "Despite the blow, Poilievre vowed to remain in his position as party leader, and he pledged in a speech Monday night to keep fighting for change.",
      "\"Every single day, our conservative caucus and I will be holding the government to account on behalf of millions of Canadians who believed in the message of change,\" Poilievre told his party's supporters.",
      "According to Elections Canada, a record number of Canadians \u2014 an estimated 7.3 million \u2014  cast their votes in advance, a 25% increase compared to the 2021 elections.",
      "A diverse group of voters gathered Monday inside a school gym in Milton City, Ontario, to cast their ballots. While they were divided on who would be best to deal with Mr. Trump, they all agreed that Canada's sovereignty, tariffs and the affordability of everyday goods were the main issues on their minds as they cast their votes.",
      "\"Trump's decisions are affecting not just Canada but the rest of the world,\" a couple who voted for the Liberals told CBS News outside a polling station. \"The tariffs affected the market; it affected prices of all goods, food, anything.\"",
      "Opponents cast the Conservatives' leader Poilievre as having similarities with Mr. Trump, which may have ended up costing him on election day.",
      "\"A couple of things that, unfortunately, Pierre has come out with which we didn't agree with,\" the couple in Milton City, who wished to remain anonymous, told CBS News. \"Might sound silly, but the fact he wants to bring back plastic bags and straws \u2014 I didn't like that idea.\"",
      "One voter named Peter said he considered the issue of Canadian sovereignty while casting his vote. Although he did not specify which party he believed could best address concerns over Mr. Trump's threats to make Canada a \"51st state,\" he stressed the need for Canadian unity.",
      "John Ivsky, a self-employed businessman from Milton, said he considered the election crucial, emphasizing the issue of tariffs. He said Canada should seek more and different global partners.",
      "\"Canada needs to build its own economy and broader partnerships,\" Ivsky told CBS News. \"America shouldn't be the only economic, military, or political partner. We need partners all over the world, so we don't suffer from one political change in one country.\"",
      "\"I respect and vote for every party that can support family values, conservative values, freedom of speech, and I vote for the one that can reflect my beliefs, whether that's Liberal or Conservative,\" said Ivsky. \"At this point, Conservatives are the ones that can do that.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump once again injected himself into the election campaign. In a post on Truth Social, he repeated his idea of making Canada the 51st U.S. state and called on Canadian voters to vote for the person who could make that possible \u2014 without naming either political party.",
      "\"Good luck to the Great people of Canada. Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size,\u00a0 WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st State of the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "In response to his remarks, Poilievre said Canada would never become the 51st state, and he urged the American president to stay out of Canadian elections.",
      "\"President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,\" Poilievre said in French in a social media\u00a0post. \"Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st State. Today Canadians can vote for change so we can strengthen our country, stand on our own two feet and stand up to America from a position of strength.\"",
      "In his campaign, Carney pleaded with voters to deliver him a strong mandate to deal with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"President Trump has some obsessive ideas, and that is one,\" Carney said of the annexation threats. \"It's not a joke. It's his very strong desire to make this happen. It's one of the reasons why this crisis is so serious.\"",

    "story": [
      "The reign of Pope Francis is over, and as the Catholic Church mourns his death, it is also looking to the future. On Monday \u2014 two days after\u00a0the pope's funeral\u00a0\u2014 the Vatican confirmed that a papal conclave will begin on May 7 to choose his successor.",
      "The question now turns to which man \u2014 and it will be a man, as women cannot be ordained priests in the Catholic Church \u2014 will emerge and step onto the balcony in papal regalia to greet the crowds massed in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "Below is a look inside the conclave process, with a step-by-step breakdown of how the next pope will be chosen and anointed under Michelangelo's iconic fresco on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.",
      "What is the papal conclave, exactly?",
      "The papal conclave is the closely guarded gathering of the cardinal electors \u2014 all serving cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 to elect the next pope.",
      "The exact number varies, but there are currently 135 cardinal electors eligible to convene at the Vatican from around the world to choose the successor to Pope Francis. At least one, Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, has said he will not enter the conclave after being sentenced to 5-1/2 years in jail by a Vatican court in 2023 for embezzlement and fraud. He has denied all wrongdoing and remains free pending an appeal to the Vatican court, but said on April 29 that he would not take part in the conclave.",
      "Of all the current cardinal electors, a large majority \u2014 108 \u2014 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries, including 10 from the United States.",
      "When will the papal conclave begin?",
      "The Vatican has announced that the conclave will begin on Wednesday, May 7.",
      "Under church rules, it must start 15 to 20 days after a pope's death; Pope Francis died on April 21.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, on May 5, Vatican officials and employees who will help support the process, including other clergy, security personnel, drivers, cleaning crews, doctors and nurses, must take an oath of secrecy.",
      "How does the papal conclave work?",
      "How this assembly proceeds to choose the next pope is a process that dates back hundreds of years \u2014 an intricate, choreographed procession of rituals and ballots.",
      "On the first day of the papal conclave, the cardinal electors will shut themselves off from the outside world and begin the momentous task of choosing \u2014 likely from among their own ranks \u2014 the man who will become the 267th Bishop of Rome, better known as the pope.",
      "On Day One, the cardinals celebrate a morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walk in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, which will have undergone a security sweep to check for any illicit recording devices before their arrival.",
      "For centuries, the cardinal electors were physically locked inside the Sistine Chapel until they elected a new pontiff, left to eat and sleep beneath Michelangelo's vivid Renaissance masterpiece. These days, they do leave to rest and share meals at Santa Marta House \u2014 a hotel-like residence inside Vatican City where Francis had his own personal apartment during his pontificate \u2014 for however many days it takes them to come to a decision.",
      "Once the cardinals have all filed into the chapel, its great bronze doors are dramatically closed and sealed, and the first day's voting begins.",
      "How does the voting for a new pope work?",
      "The cardinals will have already discussed the merits of each papal prospect during days of \"general congregations\" at the Vatican before the conclave, but now the voting begins. Choosing the new pope requires not just a majority, but a two-thirds plus-one vote among the cardinal electors for a candidate to win. Pope Benedict XVI, who led the church prior to Francis, raised the threshold and enshrined the two-thirds requirement into church law two days before he stepped down.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "To vote, each cardinal writes their chosen candidate's name on a ballot, disguising his handwriting, then walks to an altar at the front of the chapel and deposits the paper onto a ceremonial plate. He then tips the ballot from the plate into a chalice-urn.",
      "As they are counted and the handwritten entries recorded by three cardinals at the altar, known as scrutineers, the ballots are deposited into another urn.",
      "A third urn, made of gilded bronze and silver and adorned with Christian imagery, is used to ferry ballots from any cardinals too ill to leave their sleeping quarters to the chapel for counting.",
      "After the first vote is held on the first afternoon, the cardinals' ballots are placed into one of two small ovens inside the Sistine Chapel and burned. A plume of smoke flows up a chimney and into the air over St. Peter's Square, watched for eagerly by the faithful, and the world's media.",
      "If that round of voting yields no winner, the smoke will be black \u2014 a sign to the world that the Holy See remains vacant.",
      "How long can a conclave last?",
      "The voting process will repeat itself the following day, with the cardinals holding two ballots in the morning and two in the afternoon. If the morning sessions are inconclusive, black smoke will be seen again around lunchtime \u2014 early morning on the U.S. East Coast.",
      "If there's still no winner following the afternoon votes, more black smoke will stream into the early evening Roman sky.",
      "If there's no two-thirds majority after three days, voting is paused for a day to allow time for prayer, discussion and a \"brief spiritual exhortation\" by the senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons.",
      "Then the voting process resumes. A conclave will last until enough of the cardinal electors agree on a choice for the next pope.",
      "How long has it taken to choose a new pope in the past?",
      "The longest conclave in history was the one that brought Pope Gregory X to the papacy in 1281. It lasted almost three years from the time the cardinals first began their voting.",
      "Recent conclaves, however, have lasted just days. Pope John Paul II needed eight ballots, over two days, to become the pontiff in 1978. His successor, Benedict XVI, was chosen on the fourth ballot, after two days, in 2005.",
      "Francis, in 2013, needed a mere five ballots, with the voting taking just 24 hours.",
      "What will happen once the conclave chooses the next pope?",
      "When enough cardinals agree on a candidate and the vote reaches the two-thirds-plus-one threshold, the chosen man is asked if he accepts the role. He will acknowledge by simply saying the word for \"I accept\" in Latin: \"Accepto.\"",
      "At that point, he becomes the new pope and will state his chosen pontifical name before the assembled cardinals. The most common papal name has been John, used 21 times. Others, including Simplicius, Hilarius and Zosimus, have only ever been used once. Pope Francis was also the first to choose his papal name.",
      "The ballots are then burned in the stove, but this time, a chemical additive is left out to create the much-anticipated plume of \"fumata bianca,\" white smoke.",
      "There has been confusion during some past conclaves over the color of the smoke rising over the chapel, so two conclaves ago, in 2005, a new tradition began. In addition to the white smoke, bells now chime, heralding the news that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "The new pope then immediately goes into a chamber adjoining the Sistine Chapel to be clad in the papal robes.",
      "As the faithful and the curious crowd into St. Peter's Square below, the cardinal deacon steps out onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to introduce the new pontiff with the famous phrase, \"Habemus papa\" \u2014 We have a pope.",

    "summary": "A Jewish prisoner at the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau secretly penned a short note and hid it inside a violin he had crafted under harrowing circumstances.",
    "story": [
      "During World War II, within the walls of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau, a Jewish prisoner secretly penned a short note and hid it inside a violin he had crafted under harrowing circumstances \u2014 a message to the future that would remain undiscovered for more than 80 years.",
      "\"Trial instrument, made under difficult conditions with no tools and materials,\" the worn note read. \"Dachau. Anno 1941, Franciszek Kempa.\"",
      "The origins of the violin, built in 1941 by Franciszek \"Franz\" Kempa while imprisoned by the Nazis at Dachau in southern Germany, remained unnoticed for decades. It wasn't until art dealers in Hungary sent the instrument out for repairs \u2014 after having stored it for years among a set of purchased furniture \u2014 that its history came to light.",
      "Although the instrument's craftsmanship pointed clearly to a skilled maker, the professional repairing it was puzzled by the poor quality of the wood and the crude tools used to create it, which didn't match the evident skill involved.",
      "\"If you look at its proportions and structure, you can see that it's a master violin, made by a man who was proficient in his craft,\" said Szandra Katona, one of the Hungarian art dealers who discovered the origins of the violin. \"But the choice of wood was completely incomprehensible.\"",
      "Motivated by the contradiction, the professional disassembled the violin, revealing Kempa's hidden note - an apparent explanation, even an apology, from a master violin maker forced by the brutal limitations of his captivity to build an instrument that fell short of his own standards.",
      "Dachau, located near Munich, was the first concentration camp established by the Nazis in March 1933. It initially housed political prisoners but later became a model for other camps, imprisoning Jews, Roma, clergy, homosexuals, and others targeted by the Nazi regime.",
      "Over time, it became a site of forced labor, medical experiments, and brutal punishment, and remained in operation until it was liberated by American forces on April 29, 1945. At least 40,000 people are believed to have died there due to starvation, disease, execution, or mistreatment.",
      "There is ample evidence that musical instruments were present in concentration camps across Central and Eastern Europe during World War II. For propaganda purposes, the Nazis often permitted or even encouraged the formation of musical groups to give a false impression to the outside world about life in the camps.",
      "However, all known instruments that survived Dachau are believed to have been brought in by prisoners. Kempa's \"violin of hope,\" as it has come to be called, is the only known instrument actually built inside the camp.",
      "It is unknown how the violin left Dachau and ultimately made its way to Hungary. But Kempa, according to documents provided to the Hungarian art dealers by the museum at the Dachau memorial site, survived the war and returned to his native Poland to continue making instruments before dying in 1953.",
      "The documents also suggest that Kempa was known to the Nazis as an instrument maker - something Tam\u00e1s T\u00e1losi, one of the art dealers, believes may have spared him the fate of millions of others that perished in the camps.",
      "\"We named it the 'violin of hope' because if someone ends up in a difficult situation, having a task or a challenge helps them get through a lot of things,\" T\u00e1losi said. \"You focus not on the problem, but on the task itself, and I think this helped the maker of this instrument to survive the concentration camp.\"",

    "story": [
      "A massive, unprecedented power outage\u00a0hit large parts of Spain as well as Portugal\u00a0on Monday. The blackout halted subway and railway trains, cut phone service and shut down traffic lights and ATMs for the millions of people who live across Europe's Iberian Peninsula.",
      "Spanish power distributor Red El\u00e9ctrica finally said early Tuesday morning that about 99% of the power capacity had been restored across the country. Monday night, many city residents, including in Spain's capital of Madrid, went to sleep in total darkness.",
      "The lights also flickered back on Tuesday morning in Portugal's capital, Lisbon. Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro had earlier said he expected power to be restored by the end of the day on Monday.",
      "Power outage hits Spain's and Portugal's capitals",
      "Offices closed and traffic was snarled as traffic lights stopped working across Madrid on Monday. It was not possible to make calls on many mobile phone networks, though some apps were working. In Barcelona, residents walked into stores searching for battery-powered radios and civilians directed traffic at junctions along the Gran Via avenue that cuts through the city.",
      "Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said that a problem in the European grid that he described as a \"strong oscillation\" was behind the outage, but that the cause was still being determined. The Spanish leader asked the public to refrain from speculation and said no theory about the cause of the outage had been discarded.",
      "REN, the Portuguese grid operator, said a rare atmospheric phenomenon in Spain from extreme temperature variations was behind the massive outage, according to the Reuters news agency. The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center issued a statement saying there was no sign the outage was due to a cyberattack.",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica declined to speculate on the causes of the blackout. Eduardo Prieto, head of operations at Red Electrica, told journalists it was unprecedented, calling the event \"exceptional and extraordinary.\"",
      "Electricity was being pulled from Morocco and France to restore power to southern and northern Spain, Sanchez said, thanking their governments. Spain was also increasing the production from hydroelectric and combined cycle thermal power plants.",
      "S\u00e1nchez convened an extraordinary meeting of Spain's National Security Council and visited Red El\u00e9ctrica to follow efforts at restoring grid operations. Montenegro said he has spoken several times to S\u00e1nchez. The Portuguese Cabinet convened an emergency meeting at the prime minister's residence.",
      "The two countries have a combined population of about 60 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected. It is rare to have such a widespread outage across the Iberian Peninsula.",
      "Spain's Canary Islands, Balearic Islands and the territories of Ceuta and Melilla, located across the Mediterranean in Africa, were not impacted by the outage.",
      "The blackout is the second serious European power outage in less than six weeks after a March 20 fire shut down Heathrow Airport in the U.K., and it comes as authorities across Europe gird against sabotage backed by Russia.",
      "A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop from around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500 megawatts to nearly 15,000 megawatts. By 7 a.m. local time on Tuesday, Red El\u00e9ctrica said the national grid was producing 21.265 megawatts, adding that 99.5% of capacity had been restored.",
      "When the blackout hit on Monday, some people were trapped in elevators, garages and subway tunnels. Almost 300 rescue operations were carried out to free those trapped inside elevators in the Madrid region alone, authorities said.",
      "Spanish airports were forced to operate on backup electrical systems and some flights were delayed, according to Aena, which runs 56 airports in Spain, including Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "In Lisbon, terminals closed and throngs of tourists sat outside in the sun and the shade, waiting for news about their flights.",
      "\"We haven't seen any plane arriving or departing in the 50 minutes we've been waiting here,\" Dutch tourist Marc Brandsma told The Associated Press.",
      "Train services in both countries ground to a halt. Video aired on Spanish television showed people evacuating metro stations in Madrid and empty stations with trains stopped in Barcelona. Spain's Transportation Minister Oscar Puente posted on the social platform X that it wouldn't be possible to restart trains later Monday, even if the power returned.",
      "Play at the Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended. Three matches were underway when power went down.",
      "Spain's traffic department asked citizens to avoid using their cars as much as possible due to the power outage, which has affected traffic lights and electrical road signage.",
      "Barcelona's streets filled with throngs of people on sidewalks, milling about in front of darkened stores and offices and exchanging information on what had happened.",
      "\"We are lucky. Some people got trapped in the metro. And there is a positive side: We are talking more with each other,\" Monste Cort\u00e9s said. She said dinner would be sliced bread and cold cuts.",
      "Immediate concerns were which phone companies still had at least some spotty coverage, or where internet access might be found. Another concern was how to get home with the subway shut and public buses packed. Some took advantage of the lack of connectivity and transport to enjoy the sunshine on restaurant terraces.",
      "In Terrassa, an industrial town 30 miles from Barcelona, stores selling generators were out of stock after people lined up to buy them.",
      "Parts of France were also briefly affected, according to Reuters. French grid operator RTE said it was working to provide power to some parts of northern Spain.",
      "In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit Lisbon and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country. Portuguese police placed more officers on duty to direct traffic and cope with increased requests for help, including from people trapped in elevators.",
      "Hospitals and other emergency services in both Spain and Portugal switched to generators. Gas stations stopped working.",
      "Portugal's National Authority for Emergencies and Civil Protection said backup power systems were operating.",
      "Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected.",

    "story": [
      "Sanaa, Yemen\u00a0\u2014 Houthi rebel-controlled media in Yemen said Monday that U.S. strikes targeted a migrant detention center and killed at least 35 people in the movement's stronghold of Saada. The U.S. military has hammered the Iran-backed Houthis with near-daily strikes since March 15 in an operation dubbed \"Rough Rider,\" seeking to end the threat they pose to vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.",
      "The Houthis have for more than a year launched strikes targeting Israel and Western vessels in the Red Sea, including U.S. warships, in what they describe as solidarity with the Palestinians, since Hamas sparked the war in Gaza by launching its unprecedented terrorist attack on Israel in October 2023.",
      "On Sunday, the military said it has hit more than 800 targets in Yemen since mid-March, killing hundreds of Houthi rebels including members of the group's leadership.",

      "\"Civil defense teams and the Red Crescent are continuing their efforts at the scene of the American crime,\" it said.",
      "AFP could not independently confirm the veracity of Al-Masirah's claim that the strikes had hit a migrant detention center, or the toll. AFP has contacted the U.S. military for comment.",
      "According to a statement cited by Al-Masirah from the Houthi administration's interior ministry, the center housed \"115 migrants, all from Africa.\"",
      "The broadcaster ran video that showed bodies stuck under rubble and rescuers working to help the casualties.",
      "The Houthis are, like Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, backed by Iran, which is Israel's arch-foe.",
      "The Houthis began targeting shipping in late 2023, preventing ships from passing through the Suez Canal \u2014 a vital route that normally carries about 12% of global trade \u2014 forcing many companies into a costly detour around the tip of southern Africa.",
      "In a statement that provided its most detailed accounting of the operation so far, CENTCOM, the U.S. military command responsible for the Middle East said: \"Since the start of Operation Rough Rider, USCENTCOM has struck over 800 targets.",
      "\"These strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders.\" \u00ad\u00ad \"The strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defence systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations,\" CENTCOM said.",
      "Despite the strikes, however, the Houthis \u2014 who control large swaths of Yemen and have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing the internationally recognized \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adgovernment since 2015 \u2014 have continued to claim attacks against both U.S. vessels and Israel.",
      "CENTCOM said that \"while the Houthis have continued to attack our vessels, our operations have degraded the pace and effectiveness of their attacks. Ballistic missile launches have dropped by 69 percent. Additionally, attacks from one-way attack drones have decreased by 55 percent.\"",
      "\"Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis. The Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime,\" the military command said.",
      "\"We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region,\" it added.",
      "Al-Masirah TV on Sunday reported that U.S. strikes on the Yemeni capital Sanaa had killed at least eight people and wounded others.",
      "The channel also broadcast video of the rubble of destroyed homes and cars, as well as blood stains on the ground, while rescuers collected what appeared to be human remains in white cloth.",
      "Also on Sunday, Houthi media said earlier strikes on Sanaa had killed two people and wounded several more.",
      "The U.S. military began conducting strikes against the Houthis, in conjunction with Britain, during former President Joe Biden's administration, and President Trump has vowed that military action against the rebels will continue until they are no longer a threat to shipping.",

    "summary": "After being accused of violating the last short-term truce, President Vladimir Putin says Russia will halt its war in Ukraine for three days to mark 80 years since the defeat of Nazi Germany.",
    "story": [
      "Russia's President Vladimir Putin has ordered a three-day ceasefire in his country's war on Ukraine, from May 8-10, coinciding with Moscow's World War II Victory Day commemorations, the Kremlin said Monday. Ukraine quickly accused Putin's forces, who are more than three years into their full-scale invasion, of violating the last ceasefire Putin declared, on Easter Sunday.",
      "The three-day truce declared by Putin on Monday covers the national holiday in Russia that coincides with Victory in Europe, or VE Day, which is marked across Europe on May 8, the date on which Nazi Germany conceded defeat to the Allied Forces in 1945. The then-Soviet Union was one of those allies, along with the United States, that defeated Adolf Hitler's fascist regime.",
      "\"Russia believes that the Ukrainian side should follow this example,\" the Kremlin said Monday in announcing Putin's order. \"In the event of violations of the truce by the Ukrainian side, the Russian armed forces will give an adequate and effective response.\"",
      "On Easter Sunday, just hours into the last temporary ceasefire that Putin declared, Ukrainian President\u00a0Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00a0accused Moscow of attempting to create a false appearance of honoring the truce. He said while air and missile strikes had at least slowed, his forces recorded 59 separate instances of Russian shelling and five attacks along the 600-mile front line, which stretches from the northern to southern borders of eastern Ukraine.",
      "\"In practice, either Putin does not have full control over his army, or the situation proves that in Russia, they have no intention of making a genuine move toward ending the war, and are only interested in favorable PR coverage,\" he wrote.",
      "Putin's unilateral declaration of another ceasefire comes amid intense pressure from the Trump administration on both Kyiv and Moscow to strike an agreement to end the fighting in the three-year war sparked by Putin's Feb. 24, 2022, full-scale invasion.",
      "On Saturday, Zelenskyy and President Trump met for about 15 minutes in St. Peter's Basilica ahead of Pope Francis' funeral.",
      "After the meeting, Mr. Trump seemed to have changed his tune on Ukraine and the war, saying Zelenskyy is ready to make a peace deal to end the war. He also criticized Russia for its recent attacks in Ukraine, even threatening banking or secondary sanctions on Moscow in a Truth Social post.",
      "\"We had a nice meeting, it was a beautiful meeting,\" Mr. Trump told reporters outside the White House on Sunday, acknowledging that Zelenskyy has a \"tough road ahead.\"",
      "Asked if he trusts Putin, Mr. Trump answered, \"You'll know in about two weeks,\" without elaborating further.",
      "Last week, Vice President JD Vance also warned that Putin and Zelenskyy must strike a deal or the Trump administration would end its efforts to forge a lasting ceasefire. It was the\u00a0second warning from the Trump administration\u00a0in less than a week, despite Mr. Trump's frequent pledges before his second term began that he would end the war immediately.",
      "\"We've issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes, or for the United States to walk away from this process,\" Vance told reporters.",
      "A couple days after Vance's warning, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told CBS News' Margaret Brennan that the Kremlin was \"ready to reach a deal\" with the U.S. on Ukraine but that some elements still needed to be \"fine tuned.\"",
      "\"The president of the United States believes \u2014 and I think rightly so \u2014 that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said.",
      "Lavrov declined to say what details were being discussed in the U.S.-Russia negotiations, or whether he believed any deal was imminent.",
      "Russia has long said it is open to a negotiated end to the war, but it has refused to offer any concessions publicly, and the Kremlin routinely insists that any ceasefire must deal with what Putin considers the \"root causes\" of the war, which he has always blamed on Ukraine and the West despite his own ordering of the invasion of a neighboring nation.",
      "Mr. Trump has at times echoed Kremlin rhetoric about the causes of the war, and senior administration officials have made it clear they believe Ukraine will have to yield some of the territory Russia has seized control of over the last decade to end the fighting. While some White House officials have said Russia will also have to make concessions, it remains unclear what the Trump administration will demand from Putin to reach a lasting truce.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met privately ahead of the funeral of Pope Francis and \"had a very productive discussion,\" the White House said Saturday.",
      "A spokesman for Ukraine's government called the meeting \"constructive\" and said the two leaders were working to arrange another. In a statement on social media, Zelenskyy said it was a \"good meeting.\"",
      "\"We discussed a lot one on one,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out. Very symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results. Thank you @POTUS.\"",
      "Ukraine's presidential press service released images of the meeting, as well as an image of a meeting between Mr. Trump, Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Hours after his meeting with Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he doubts Russian President Vladimir Putin's willingness to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,\" he wrote in the post. \"It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump is trying to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, after first sending troops into eastern Ukraine in 2014.",
      "After their brief meeting on Saturday, Zelenskyy's office said the U.S. and Ukrainian teams were making arrangements for the leaders to talk again that day. But Mr. Trump went directly to the Rome airport after the funeral and boarded Air Force One for the 10-hour flight back to the United States.",
      "Zelenskyy's spokesperson, Serhii Nykyforov, said Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy did not meet again in person because of their tight schedules.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday was among more than 50 heads of state and other dignitaries attending the funeral of Pope Francis, where he was personally paying his respects to the Roman Catholic leader who pointedly disagreed with him on a variety of issues.",
      "He also briefly met Britain's Prince William, CBS News partner network BBC News reported.",
      "Mr. Trump arrived at the Vatican with his wife, first lady Melania Trump. When Zelenskyy arrived for the ceremony, the gathered crowd broke out in applause.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday as he flew to Rome that he was going to the funeral \"out of respect\" for the pontiff, who died Monday after suffering a stroke at the age of 88.",
      "Francis sharply disagreed with Mr. Trump's approach on issues including immigration, the treatment of migrants and climate change. The Argentine pontiff and the American president sparred early in their relationship over immigration. In 2016, Francis, alluding to then-candidate Trump and his campaign slogan of \"Build the wall,\" called anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants \"not Christian.\" Mr. Trump said the comment was \"disgraceful.\"",
      "But after Francis' death, the Republican president praised him as a \"good man\" who \"worked hard\" and \"loved the world.\" Mr. Trump also directed that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff in Francis' honor.",
      "Mr. Trump had said on a couple of occasions before leaving Washington that he would have \"a lot\" of meetings with counterparts on the sidelines of the funeral. But he seemed to back away from that as he flew to Rome.",
      "\"Frankly, it's a little disrespectful to have meetings when you're at the funeral of a pope,\" the president told reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump said, \"I'll be talking to people. I'll be seeing a lot of people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't elaborate when asked if he'd just be meeting leaders in passing or holding more in-depth talks. He suggested he might have meetings at Villa Taverna, the U.S. ambassador's residence, where he spent the night.",
      "\"It's a little tough because we don't have much time,\" Mr. Trump said, noting his late arrival in Rome. He was scheduled to head back to the United States immediately after the funeral.",
      "\"I think that we're going to try and see a couple of people that are important in what we're doing,\" said Mr. Trump, who is trying to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and negotiate trade agreements with multiple countries.",
      "He posted on Truth Social shortly after arriving in Rome that Ukraine and Russia should meet for \"very high level talks\" on ending the bloody three-year war sparked by Russia's invasion. His envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin earlier Friday, and Mr. Trump said both sides were \"very close to a deal.\"",

      "Kara Schmiemann of Red Banyan PR told Fox News Digital, \"This type of strategy, flooding the market with appearances as an attempt to show normalcy and appear[ing] unbothered or unaffected by the drama, is typically not well-advised in crisis response planning.\"",
      "\"While there is certainly a time and place for this approach, and it can sometimes be very effective, in this case it doesn't allow for the heat to die down. The public can be forgiving, but they need time and a reason to forgive and forget. Blake and Ryan seem to be continuing to fan the flames, and it is not landing particularly well for all circles.\"",
      "\"If the PDA-filled images were all that the public saw, their PDA would have definitely helped their image amid the ongoing Baldoni lawsuit drama, because they have always been celebrated as a Hollywood \u2018it couple\u2019 with an amazing relationship,\" relationship expert Nicole Moore said. \"The issue for Blake and Ryan's image is that a large portion of the public no longer gets their information solely from media outlets but from social media and online commentators.\"",

      "\"When the public sees Blake and Ryan looking lovey-dovey at an event, but then goes on TikTok and sees a video about a lip-reader sharing that Blake ordered Ryan to kiss her, for instance, it creates mistrust in the couple and plants seeds of doubt that their relationship is staged,\" she explained. \"So much of the public opinion regarding the Baldoni lawsuit drama has been shaped by voices outside of traditional media, and that's been to Blake and Ryan's detriment.\"",

      "Crediting her mother for influencing her with her \"unwavering bravery,\" Lively said her mom \"never got justice\" from the incident and explained she survived the incident because she had heard stories from women in similar circumstances, particularly a story shared on a radio show.",
      "\"And because of hearing that woman speak to her experience instead of shutting down in fear and unfair shame, my mom is alive today,\" Lively said.",
      "\"Unlike her public displays of affection with her husband, which has been par for the course throughout their courtship and marriage, the timing of this revelation hits the 'funny bone' of armchair skeptics, causing them to jerk in response,\" Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PR, told Fox News Digital.",
      "He continued, \"Given all the scrutiny surrounding her demeanor during the press tour for 'It Ends With Us,' why not bring this incredibly personal experience up then? Wouldn't that have lent a sense of authenticity and relatability in terms of her passion and commitment to a film that was tackling such a difficult topic as domestic abuse?",

      "\"Sadly, whether accurate or not, this comes off as a thinly veiled attempt at garnering public sympathy by repositioning herself as the 'victim' in hopes of distracting and reframing the audience's focus.\"",
      "Schmiemann agreed, saying, \"If this was a ploy to gain sympathy, that can be easily sussed out by the public and could be even more damaging. And in this particular case, the irony of discussing assault now, when she previously received backlash for not sufficiently highlighting the horrors of domestic violence in her movie promotion strategy, it is a tough one to\u00a0reconcile.\"",
      "\"The public can be forgiving, but they need time and a reason to forgive and forget.\"",
      "While public opinion remains divided on Lively and Reynolds, they have at least one famous name offering support: Reynolds\u2019 \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" co-star Hugh Jackman.",

      "Moore says, \"Hollywood actors are often obsessed with protecting their image and profitability, so the fact that Hugh is supporting Blake and Ryan publicly likely means that he doesn't\u00a0anticipate doing so will hurt his own brand.\u00a0There has been extensive media coverage on the close friendly relationship between Hugh and Ryan, so it would\u00a0likely\u00a0appear weird to the public if Hugh didn't support his friend.\"",
      "\"If the lawsuit ends up going in Baldoni's favor and the public starts to see\u00a0Blake and Ryan as perpetrators of harm due to the verdict, that's likely when Hugh will need to distance himself from the couple in order to\u00a0protect his image,\" she added.",
      "Just as Lively and Reynolds have continued to step out in public, Justin Baldoni has remained largely hidden from view.",
      "\"Baldoni is making the right move by avoiding the public eye because he's mitigating any\u00a0damage that\u00a0might occur from a misstep at a\u00a0public\u00a0appearance,\" Moore said. \"Right now,\u00a0Baldoni appears to have the favor of the\u00a0public, and he's wise to ride the wave of that\u00a0favor without adding any potentially negative press or attention to the mix.\"",

      "JUSTIN BALDONI CALLS OUT BLAKE LIVELY FOR DEMANDING PRIVACY AFTER PUBLICIZING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS",
      "She continued, \"Baldoni's strategy appears to be mostly defending back after\u00a0he's directly attacked\u00a0rather than\u00a0attempting to position himself favorably through public\u00a0appearances,\u00a0and this appears to be working as it makes the public see him as the little guy defending\u00a0himself against Hollywood giants.\"",
      "In Eldridge\u2019s opinion: \"Baldoni's moves have been flawless up to this point. From an optics standpoint, he had an accuser make the first move with a splashy, long-form piece in the New York Times. His response was measured and meaningful; ironically, it centered mostly on a series of indelible 'receipts' as well as allowing fans to find the cracks in Lively's sidewalk, knowing she'd eventually trip up.\"",
      "Schmiemann said, \"Time and silence cannot be underestimated when dealing with as much nuance and public criticism as Blake and Ryan seem to be facing. Of course, they must still live their lives and work and care for their family, but being strategic about the when and where is incredibly important. If they continue to step out too frequently, you create additional opportunities for the story to remain in the public eye and for a repeated resurgence of criticism and hate.\"",

Before 9/11, standards for issuing driver's licenses and other IDs varied widely among states, with little coordination or verification of critical documents like birth certificates and Social Security numbers. Several of the 9/11 hijackers were able to obtain legitimate state IDs using fraudulent documents, enabling them to move freely and board planes without detection.",
      "The 9/11 Commission Report, released in 2004, strongly recommended establishing national standards for identification as a counterterrorism measure.

In other instances, young men and women are made to question whether they were born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their reality as enemies to be blamed. These practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity,\" the executive order, \"Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,\" reads.",

      "A tariff negotiation blitz is now underway as nations across the world look to book meetings with the White House to iron out more favorable terms.

      "\"So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game, and we will see if they follow through on that,\" Bessent continued.",
      "Concerns have mounted that the tariffs will cause American consumers to spend more at the checkout lines.

      "Trump said earlier this month that there is a \"real chance\" tariffs could replace income tax.",
      "\"There's a real chance,\" Trump said in an interview with Fox News' Rachel Campos-Duffy. \"There is a chance that the money from tariffs could be so great that it would replace. You know, in the old days, about 1870 to 1913, the tariffs were the only form of money. And that's when our nation was relatively the richest. We were the richest.\"",
      "The president said during the interview that there was a committee formed in the 1880s to \"get rid of money.\""

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Cybercriminals always find new ways to scam you, whether it\u2019s mimicking a government agency, creating a fake website or delivering malware disguised as a software update. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, they come up with a new trick.",
      "This time, the FBI has issued an alert: Hackers are using a \"time-traveling\" technique to bypass your device\u2019s security measures. No, we\u2019re not talking about actual time travel (though wouldn\u2019t that be something?). This is a sophisticated cyberattack where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to sneak past security defenses.",

      "A man working on his laptops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The concept of \"time-traveling hackers\" refers not to literal time travel but to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures. This attack is reportedly tied to the Medusa ransomware gang.",
      "In this type of attack, hackers exploit expired security certificates by altering the system date on a targeted device to a time when those certificates were still valid. For example, a security certificate that expired in, say, 2020 could be made usable again if the system's clock is set back to 2019. This allows malicious software signed with these outdated certificates to be recognized as legitimate by the system, effectively \"traveling back in time\" from a security perspective.",
      "This technique was notably used in the Medusa ransomware attacks, which targeted critical infrastructure and prompted an\u00a0FBI cybersecurity advisory (AA25-071A) earlier in 2025. The campaign has affected over 300 critical infrastructure targets. The attackers combined this method with social engineering and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, amplifying the threat.",
      "The FBI has warned that such attacks pose a significant risk, as they can disable modern security protections like Windows Defender by tricking the system into accepting outdated drivers or software.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "What does the FBI recommend?",
      "The FBI is urging organizations to take action quickly, warning that this technique can slip past traditional defenses by taking advantage of how systems trust old certificate data.",
      "To stay protected, they recommend turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere, especially for important stuff like webmail and VPNs. It also helps to have strong endpoint protection and clear security policies and to keep an eye out for any weird changes to system settings, like the device clock suddenly jumping back in time.",
      "A man working on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "5 ways to stay safe from Medusa malware",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus isn\u2019t just for catching old-school viruses anymore. It can detect phishing links, block malicious downloads and stop ransomware before it gets a foothold. Since the Medusa gang uses fake updates and social engineering to trick users, having strong antivirus software adds a critical layer of protection against threats you might not see coming. Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0The FBI specifically recommends\u00a0enabling 2FA across all services, especially for high-value targets like webmail accounts, VPNs and remote access tools. 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to break in, even if they\u2019ve managed to steal your username and password through phishing or other tactics.",
      "3)\u00a0Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Many ransomware groups, including Medusa, rely on reused or weak passwords to gain access. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Monitor for suspicious system time changes:\u00a0The core of this \"time-traveling\" attack is clock manipulation: Hackers roll back a device\u2019s clock to a time when expired security certificates were still valid. This allows outdated and potentially malicious software to appear trustworthy. Be alert to unexpected system time changes, and if you're managing an organization, use tools that flag and log these types of configuration shifts.",
      "5) Keep systems updated and patch known vulnerabilities:\u00a0The Medusa ransomware campaign has a track record of exploiting unpatched systems. That means old software, outdated drivers and ignored security updates can all become entry points. Regularly\u00a0installing updates for your OS, applications and drivers is one of the most effective ways to stay protected. Don't put off those system notifications; they exist for a reason.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Medusa attack is a good example of how cybercriminals are shifting tactics. Instead of relying on traditional methods like brute force or obvious exploits, they are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function. In this case, it is something as simple as the system clock. This kind of strategy challenges the way we think about security. It is not just about building stronger defenses but also about questioning the default assumptions built into the technology we use every day.",

      "What is SPROUT?",
      "SPROUT, short for Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit, is a flexible, vine-like robot developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratory in collaboration with the University of Notre Dame. Unlike rigid robots or static cameras, SPROUT can \"grow\" into tight, winding spaces that are otherwise inaccessible, giving first responders a new way to explore, map and assess collapsed structures.",

      "How does SPROUT work?",
      "SPROUT is made of an airtight fabric tube that inflates with air, allowing it to extend from a fixed base. As it grows, it can flex around corners and squeeze through narrow gaps, mimicking the movement of a plant vine. Operators control SPROUT using a joystick, steering it through debris while watching a live video feed from a camera mounted at the tip. This setup lets responders see and map hidden void spaces without entering dangerous areas themselves.",
      "Three pouch motors along the vine\u2019s length enable SPROUT to bend and turn, while an internal reel system allows the robot to be compactly stored and precisely deployed as needed.

      "What you need to know",
      "Blue Shield of California just admitted to a major data privacy slip that went on for almost three years, from April 2021 to January 2024. It was using Google Analytics to track how people used its member websites. This is totally normal since every business does it. But the tool was accidentally sharing sensitive info with Google Ads because it wasn\u2019t set up properly.",
      "What I find extremely shocking is that it took the company three years to realize it was sharing its user data with Google to run ads. This says a lot about how much these healthcare giants care about protecting your data.",
      "The shared data included a broad array of protected health information (PHI), including names, zip codes, gender, medical claim dates, online account numbers, insurance plan names, group numbers, family data and even search criteria used in its \"Find a Doctor\" feature.",
      "\"Google may have used this data to conduct focused ad campaigns back to those individual members. We want to reassure our members that no bad actor was involved, and, to our knowledge, Google has not used the information for any purpose other than these ads or shared the protected information with anyone,\"\u00a0the company\u00a0said in a notice on its website.",
      "This incident is not isolated. Over the past few years, healthcare and tech companies have come under scrutiny for similar missteps. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have already issued warnings about the use of tracking technologies in healthcare, especially those that might expose patient data to third parties without adequate transparency or safeguards.",

It\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone else will gain access to it, so the chances of the data being misused are slim. Google says it doesn\u2019t allow ads to be served based on sensitive information like health, so there\u2019s a good chance your data wasn\u2019t even used for advertising.",

      "It baffles me how careless most companies are when it comes to protecting user data. Blue Shield \"mistakenly\" shared your data with Google, which then used it to show personalized ads. It took the company three years to realize this. While most cyber incidents involve an attacker, this breach didn\u2019t need one. We need accountability in data practices, especially when human error or tech oversight can cause damage at scale.",

      "The RockYou2024 leak, which exposed almost 10 billion passwords in July of last year, might seem like old news, but its impact is still felt today.",
      "It's considered the largest password compilation ever released.\u00a0With such a vast collection of breached credentials circulating, the risk of credential stuffing, identity theft and unauthorized access to online accounts and systems remains high. For anyone still reusing passwords, the dangers are real \u2014 and growing.",

      "Username and password on tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why does password strength matter?",
      "Think of weak passwords as an open door for hackers. Recent reports show that many common passwords can be cracked in literally seconds. Simple or reused passwords are especially vulnerable to automated attacks, and once one account is breached, others are often quickly compromised.",
      "If a company you\u2019re signed up with experiences a\u00a0data breach and your login info is leaked, attackers can try that same password on other platforms, potentially unlocking a lot more than just one account.",
      "Strong passwords act as your first line of defense. They\u2019re long, complex and unique, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess or force their way in. When every account has its own strong password, even if one gets leaked, the rest stay safe.",
      "Think of it this way. A weak password is like using the same key for your house, car and office and leaving it under the doormat. A strong password? It\u2019s like a unique, high-security key for every door in your digital life.",

Grab a pen (or just keep a mental tally) and score yourself based on this 7-point password strength test.\u00a0Each \"yes\" earns you a point.\u00a0So, let\u2019s see how your password holds up in today\u2019s threat landscape.",
      "Length is your first line of defense. Short passwords \u2014 think six or eight characters \u2014 can be cracked in minutes by modern hacking tools. At 12 characters or more, you\u2019re making it exponentially harder for attacks to succeed.",
      "Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters strengthens your password by increasing complexity. For example, instead of using something like \"t8g5k9w2,\" use \"T8g5K9w2\" \u2014 same characters, just more variety. Mix it up.",
      "Adding numbers makes your password harder to crack. Instead of sticking to just letters \u2014 like \"Trkplmsh\" \u2014 try something like \"Tr8k5Plm2sh.\" Randomly placed numbers increase complexity and make your password much more secure.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Symbols like !, @, #, and $ add another layer of security. For example, a password like \"T8g5K9w2\" becomes even stronger as \"T8g5#K9w2!.\" Special characters increase complexity and help defend against attacks.",
      "Reusing passwords is like handing hackers a master key. If one account gets breached, and you\u2019ve reused that password elsewhere, you\u2019re toast. One password, one purpose. No exceptions.",
      "Your name, birthday or \"Fluffy1990\" (your dog\u2019s name and birth year) might feel clever, but they\u2019re goldmines for attackers who can scrape social media or breached data. Keep it impersonal and unpredictable.",
      "Even good passwords can go stale. It\u2019s a smart move to update them every 90 days, or sooner if a site you use has a security issue.",

      "What should I do if my password strength is low?",
      "If your score didn\u2019t quite hit that seven out of seven mark, no worries. The good news? You\u2019ve already taken the first step by identifying the weak spots. Now, you\u2019ve got two options:",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To keep your passwords secure, use ones that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common patterns. Always use a different password for each account, and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication whenever it's available.",
      "While you can build a strong password on your own, let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s not always easy. Coming up with something that\u2019s at least 12 characters long, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and isn\u2019t based on anything personal? That\u2019s a tall order. And even if you do manage to craft the perfect one, you\u2019ve still got to remember it, especially if you\u2019re using a different strong password for every account (which you absolutely should be).",
      "This is the easier, faster and frankly smarter route. A password generator creates long, complex, completely random passwords for you \u2014 no guesswork or mental gymnastics required. These tools are designed to pump out passwords that check all the boxes, making them far harder to crack. If you want an easy and secure option, many password managers include built-in password generators that follow best practices for maximum strength.",
      "Either way, the key takeaway is this: Don\u2019t settle for weak or recycled passwords. Whether you go DIY or use a tool, upgrading your password strength is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself online.",
      "Illustration of online banking login on laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the best password manager?",
      "Password security can seem like a tough thing to maintain manually. The good news is that password managers take the hassle out of it by generating, storing and autofilling strong, unique passwords for you.",
      "We recommend a password manager that is secure, user-friendly and includes features like a password health tool, data breach monitoring and a built-in password generator to help you create strong, unique passwords. Essentially, they are a digital safe designed to encrypt and store your login credentials, passkeys, credit card details, personal information and even sensitive files. It remembers everything for you, organizes your credentials neatly and fills in login forms with a single click. When you sign up for a new site, it autosaves the password with no effort required.",
      "The best part? A password manager puts an end to password reuse. Instead of leaning on that tired old \"Fluffy1990\" for every account, it generates strong, unique passwords tailored to each site, boosting security for both your personal and professional life. So, with a password manager, you\u2019ll no longer have to ask yourself, how secure is my password?",

    "story": [
      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "Most companies use different vendors to run different parts of their business, such as customer management, finances, payroll and social media. To do this, they share access to customer data with these platforms. The issue is that not all vendors take cybersecurity seriously, and hackers are well aware of that.",
      "More and more, attackers are going after these weaker links in the digital supply chain. These kinds of breaches often happen quietly, exposing large amounts of customer information without touching a company\u2019s main systems. It\u2019s becoming a serious concern for both businesses and their customers.",
      "One of the latest cases involves Hertz, the car rental giant, which recently confirmed that customer data was exposed because of a cyberattack on one of its software vendors.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":\u00a0Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free\u00a0\"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"\u00a0when you sign up!",
      "Hertz rental location (Hertz)",
      "What happened at Hertz?",
      "Hertz, the global car rental company that also operates Dollar and Thrifty, has\u00a0disclosed a data breach affecting thousands of its customers. The incident stems from a cyberattack on one of its third-party vendors, software provider Cleo, in October 2024 and December 2024. The breach did not compromise Hertz\u2019s internal systems directly but involved data that had been shared with the vendor as part of its operational workflow.",
      "The compromised data varies by region but includes sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact details, driver\u2019s license numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and other government-issued IDs. Certain financial information, including payment card details and workers\u2019 compensation claims, was also among the stolen records.",
      "In the U.S., disclosures were filed with regulatory bodies in California, Texas and Maine. Specifically, 3,457 individuals were affected in Maine and 96,665 in Texas. The total global impact, however, is believed to be far greater. Customers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand and the U.K. were also notified via breach notices on Hertz\u2019s regional websites.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach is believed to be the work of the Clop ransomware gang, a well-known Russia-linked hacking group. Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Cleo\u2019s enterprise file transfer software, technology used by many large organizations to securely transmit sensitive business data. In 2024, the gang launched a mass-hacking campaign targeting Cleo users, ultimately stealing data from more than 60 companies, including Hertz.",
      "Interestingly, while Hertz was named on Clop\u2019s dark web leak site in 2024, the company initially stated it had \"no evidence\" its systems or data had been compromised.",
      "When contacted by CyberGuy, a Hertz spokesperson said, \"At Hertz, we take the privacy and security of personal information seriously. This vendor event involves Cleo, a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. Importantly, to date, our forensic investigation has found no evidence that Hertz's own network was affected by this event. However, among many other companies affected by this event, we have confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo's platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\"",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "What does this mean for customers?",
      "While Hertz\u2019s internal systems were not breached, the exposure of personal data, including driver\u2019s license numbers, contact details and government-issued IDs, poses serious risks. Affected individuals may be vulnerable to identity theft, fraudulent account openings and targeted\u00a0phishing attempts. If Social Security numbers were involved, the potential for harm increases significantly. Anyone who rented from Hertz, Dollar or Thrifty between October and December 2024 should be on high alert.",

      "1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Hertz breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Hertz breach, including Social Security numbers, driver's license and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cyber risk doesn\u2019t always come from a company\u2019s own network. It often originates in unseen corners of the digital supply chain. Even as companies double down on internal cybersecurity, they must be equally rigorous in how they vet and monitor third-party vendors. For consumers, it\u2019s no longer enough to trust the big brand on the label. The data trail is wider, the attack surface larger and the consequences far more opaque.",

      "Browser extensions can be a great way to boost your productivity while browsing. Chrome, which is the most popular browser out there, supports a wide range of extensions, and so do other Chromium-based browsers. However, these extensions are not always beneficial. While many are helpful for blocking ads, finding the best deals or checking grammar errors, some can end up doing more harm than good.",
      "I recently\u00a0reported on a group of malicious extensions that were stealing user data, and now a new report has flagged 35 more suspicious ones. These browser extensions request unnecessary permissions and have been reported to collect and share everything you do online.",

      "Sketchy extensions in the wild",
      "A recent\u00a0investigation by John Tuckner, founder of Secure Annex, revealed concerns about 35 Chrome extensions, posing potential privacy and security risks. These extensions, many unlisted on the Chrome Web Store, were collectively installed over 4 million times.",
      "Many of these sketchy extensions presented themselves as tools for search assistance, ad-blocking, security monitoring or extension scanning but shared a connection to a single, unused domain, suggesting coordinated behavior. They all use the same code patterns, connect to some of the same servers and require the same list of sensitive systems permissions, including the ability to interact with web traffic on all URLs visited, access cookies, manage browser tabs and execute scripts.",
      "What\u2019s more concerning is that at least 10 of these extensions carried Google\u2019s \"Featured\" badge, implying vetting for trustworthiness. This raises questions about Google\u2019s review process, as the badge suggests compliance with high standards for user experience, privacy and security.",

      "Why are these extensions bad?",
      "The main concern is the level of access these extensions quietly request and how they use it. With permissions to read tabs, access cookies, intercept web requests and inject scripts into pages, they can monitor nearly everything you do in your browser. This includes tracking your browsing activity, observing login sessions and altering the content of websites you visit, all without your knowledge.",
      "These extensions are not simply misconfigured tools. They appear to be intentionally designed with surveillance in mind. Many store their configuration data locally, which allows remote servers to update their behavior at any time. This setup is commonly seen in spyware, where changes can be made after installation without alerting the user. The code is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult for researchers to understand what the extensions are actually doing.",
      "In some cases, the extensions appear to do nothing at all when clicked. However, they continue to send data in the background. For instance, the Fire Shield Extension Protection remained inactive until the researcher manually triggered it with a specific extension ID. Only then did it begin to transmit browsing activity and other data, revealing behavior that would be hard for an average user to detect.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from sketchy extensions",
      "If you\u2019re worried about the above extensions, here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1)\u00a0Keep your browser up to date: Chrome gets regular updates that get rid of most security issues. Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2) Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",
      "3) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0A good antivirus can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5) Change your passwords and do it safely: If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via Chrome\u2019s built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer, where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then consider switching to a\u00a0password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward. I\u2019ve reviewed the top options in my\u00a0best password managers of 2025 guide. See which one fits your needs best.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The fact that several of these extensions carried Google\u2019s own \"Featured\" badge should serve as a wake-up call. It points to a serious lapse in oversight and raises concerns about how thorough Chrome\u2019s extension review process actually is. When millions of users unknowingly install spyware under the impression that it has been vetted and approved, the issue is no longer just about bad actors. It reflects a deeper failure within the platform itself. Google needs to take stronger responsibility by improving transparency and tightening its review standards.",

It\u2019s one of the first truly autonomous AI agents, able to do its own research, make decisions and even carry out plans, all with barely any human oversight.",
      "Sounds impressive, right? But here\u2019s the thing: While all this innovation opens up exciting possibilities, it also brings some serious privacy and security questions. Whether you\u2019re eager to try out the latest AI or you\u2019d rather steer clear, it\u2019s worth understanding what Manus could mean for your personal data and digital safety.",

      "Your data could be used to train AI, even if you go nowhere near it",
      "This has already been happening for a while with other AI models. There have been\u00a0several class-action lawsuits against tech companies for scraping personal data for\u00a0use in AI training, with one lawsuit claiming that OpenAI uses \"stolen private information, including personally identifiable information, from hundreds of millions of internet users, including children of all ages, without their informed knowledge or consent.\"",
      "Many companies also sell or share data with third parties, including for the purposes of AI training. For example, X has been using personal data to train its AI, Grok, and is also sharing user data with third parties to train AI models. So whether you use AI (including\u00a0Manus AI when it\u2019s released to the public) or not, there\u2019s still a good chance that they have your personal information.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN",
      "Why should you care if AI has your data?",
      "It boils down to data privacy and security. When AI companies collect personal information \u2013 things like your name, email address, home location, social media posts and even photos \u2013 they often store it in large databases to train their models. If those databases aren\u2019t properly secured, they can become gold mines for hackers. Think of them as digital \"honey pots\": sweet and tempting to cybercriminals because of all the personal data inside.",
      "This isn\u2019t just a theoretical risk. Just this year, another AI company,\u00a0DeepSeek, experienced a major leak that exposed more than a million sensitive records. When this kind of information gets out, it can end up on the dark web where scammers and identity thieves are more than happy to scoop it up. That\u2019s how people end up dealing with everything from identity theft and impersonation to tons of spam calls, phishing emails and targeted scams.",
      "But data leaks aren\u2019t the only danger. Even when the information is secure, it can be misused or manipulated in ways that are hard to detect. One of the biggest new threats is something called a prompt injection attack.",
      "In simple terms, prompt injection is a way for attackers to trick an AI into doing something it wasn\u2019t supposed to. Researchers recently found that attackers can embed hidden commands in seemingly harmless text, like a website bio, email signature or even a social media post. When the AI reads that text during training or browsing, it can accidentally follow the hidden instructions, which might tell it to leak information, change how it behaves or give unauthorized access to private data.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DANGERS OF OVER-SHARING WITH AI TOOLS",
      "Manus AI poses even bigger risks",
      "Unlike most AI tools that respond to commands you give them directly, Manus is autonomous, meaning it can act on its own, follow links, read content and make decisions without human approval. While that sounds pretty cool, it\u2019s also what makes it a lot harder to spot when something goes wrong.",
      "If Manus encounters malicious content, it could unknowingly follow a hidden prompt, compromise your data or alter its behavior, and there may be no obvious sign that anything has happened until it\u2019s too late. There are also some concerns about where Manus sends and stores data. Security researchers have traced data back to servers in Shenzhen, China, raising red flags about surveillance, jurisdiction and who might ultimately have access to your information.",
      "So even if Manus isn\u2019t scraping anything too sensitive today, the combination of weak oversight, powerful automation and questionable data practices makes it far riskier than your average AI assistant.",

      "GENAI, THE FUTURE OF FRAUD AND WHY YOU MAY BE AN EASY TARGET",
      "So, how can you protect yourself?",
      "As I\u2019ve mentioned, whether you use Manus AI or not, your personal information will still likely end up in its datasets, so the best way to protect yourself is to make your information difficult to find. Here are some things you can do.",
      "1) Be cautious about using Manus: With that level of autonomy, especially since it\u2019s a very new AI (not to mention the inconsistency in its privacy policy regarding governance), I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it quite yet. There\u2019s just too much damage it can do if it malfunctions or is subject to a prompt injection attack.",
      "2) Keep your personal information under wraps: With so many companies selling and trading personal information, many of them to tech companies to train AI, it\u2019s a good idea to withhold your data unless you absolutely can\u2019t avoid sharing it.",
      "3) Actively remove your personal information from the internet so your data can\u2019t be scraped by AI models like Manus: Set your social media to private, limit data collection through privacy settings and remove your information from data brokers and people-search sites. Autonomous cloud-based agents such as Manus are designed to extract and analyze vast amounts of online data, and your publicly available information can be swept into their training datasets without your knowledge or consent.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software to help defend against the broader attack surface created by autonomous AI systems: Manus\u2019 ability to act independently and interact with external systems increases the risk of adversarial attacks and malware transmission, so robust endpoint security is essential to protect your devices and data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Use privacy-focused products and services: Whenever you cannot avoid sharing personal information, opt for companies that prioritize your privacy. For example, use the DuckDuckGo browser instead of Chrome and Brave or Proton Mail instead of Gmail.\u00a0Check out the best private and safe browser alternatives to Google.",
      "6) Keep all software updated, including your operating system, browsers and security tools, to patch vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit: As AI agents like Manus operate in the cloud and may interact with your systems, unpatched software can become an easy target for exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's always a good idea to keep software, operating systems, browsers and security tools\u00a0updated at all times.",
      "7) Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all your accounts: As AI-driven attacks and automated data extraction become more common,\u00a0MFA adds a crucial layer of defense, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your accounts, even if an AI system leaks or scrapes your credentials.",
      "8) Use strong, unique passwords for every account: As cloud-based AI agents like Manus can interact with external systems and potentially access sensitive data, unique passwords help prevent a breach of one account from leading to a broader compromise. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "As we move forward with AI like Manus, it\u2019s exciting to think about the possibilities, but it's also important to keep our eyes open about what it means for our personal data. Even if you never use Manus yourself, your info could still end up in its training data.",
      "So what can you do? Stay informed, take charge of your digital footprint and choose tools that prioritize your privacy. As AI keeps evolving, being proactive about your data is the best way to enjoy the benefits of innovation while keeping your personal info safe.",

      "Tevel\u2019s Flying Autonomous Robots (FARs) are redefining fruit harvesting by combining artificial intelligence with advanced computer vision. These drones navigate through orchards, identifying and picking only the fruit that has reached peak ripeness. Their ability to maneuver carefully around branches allows them to harvest without bruising or harming the trees. Unlike human pickers, these drones can operate continuously, working day and night to get the job done faster and more consistently.",
      "Farmers benefit from detailed, real-time information about the harvest, including the size, color and ripeness of each fruit, all accessible through a mobile app. This data helps optimize harvesting schedules and reduce waste. FARs have already been deployed in orchards across the United States, Italy, Chile and Israel, where they have helped reduce labor costs by up to 30% while improving harvest accuracy. Multiple drones work together from a mobile platform, covering large orchard areas efficiently.",

      "\"When Donald Trump is in the news saying 51st-state stuff, that brings the focus back to the major issue that the Liberals lead on, which is dealing with him,\" said Bricker.",

      "The irony, in Reid\u2019s view, is that \"Trump imperiled the campaign of an individual who could be in many ways his stepbrother in Canada,\" he said about Poilievre, who he called \"mini-Trump,\" and his \"anti-woke,\" smaller-government stance \u2013 \"Trump-esque policies that the American right might want to see in Canada and certainly a lot of Canadians on the right want to see.\"",

      "The former head of Project 2025 believes an \u201cunchained\u201d President Donald Trump has made immense progress during the first 100 days of his second term toward undoing liberal gains dating back to Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
      "But Paul Dans \u2014 who led the effort to produce a detailed conservative transition plan and policy blueprint that was at the center of last year\u2019s presidential election \u2014 believes the president needs an influx of new attorneys to fight for his policies in court. Those battles, Dans told NBC News, will shape the next 100 days.",
      "\u201cIf Roosevelt had the New Deal, this is what I would think of as Trump\u2019s real deal,\u201d Dans said. \u201cThis is deconstructing the administrative state and walking back a lot of this progressive architecture that had been built up by FDR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s coming next is really a squaring off with the courts,\u201d Dans said, adding, \u201cThis is going to reach, certainly, a boiling point, and so look to that getting resolved.\u201d",
      "The Dans-led Project 2025 was an effort overseen by the Heritage Foundation ahead of the 2024 campaign, which began with the basic premise of setting up a future right-wing administration to govern on Day 1 with more preparation and planning than Trump had for his first term. Much of Project 2025 centered on plans for radically restructuring the civil service, as well as providing a database of potential MAGA-inspired hires in a new administration.",
      "But it was a 900-plus-page memo, outlining many policy positions a future administration should consider, that garnered the most attention, as Democrats put it at the center of their campaign. Even though many of the policies included in the document mirrored policies Trump pledged to enact in his own plan, Agenda47, the president and his campaign distanced themselves from Project 2025 on the trail. And Dans, who worked in Trump\u2019s first administration, was forced out of his position over the summer as anger from the campaign intensified.",
      "After Trump won, however, he hired multiple authors of the report to key positions, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, immigration czar Tom Homan, top trade adviser Peter Navarro and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, among others. NBC News reported during the transition that the transition team was utilizing the Project 2025 database of potential hires, too.",
      "The blueprint ultimately foreshadowed plenty of what Trump has enacted or attempted once in power. An independent tracker found that the administration has completed or taken action on roughly 40% of the material in Project 2025\u2019s blueprint. That includes everything from cutting research grants to universities to readying cuts for climate research, stripping some immigrants of Temporary Protected Status, and an all-out assault on diversity programs in government.",
      "With that in the foreground as Trump hits the 100-day mark, Dans spoke with NBC News in a pair of interviews in recent days. He doesn\u2019t believe measuring Trump\u2019s actions against Project 2025\u2019s plan \u201cis really accurate,\u201d adding, \u201cthese are, to be sure, President Trump\u2019s own policies, many of which were embodied in Project 2025.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s with great excitement that I read what\u2019s going on every day and see a new step that they\u2019re taking,\u201d Dans said. \u201cBut to be sure, this has to get implemented. At this point, a lot of the executive orders and the like are policy pronouncements, and the real rubber is going to meet the road when it comes to implementing all these directives.\u201d",
      "With a tightly divided Congress passing few new laws, though, a number of Trump\u2019s executive initiatives \u2014\u00a0whether they be on immigration, the civil service or federal funding \u2014\u00a0are tied up in court battles that will be key in determining just how far the president is able to go.",
      "\u201cMany of us always saw this as the ultimate end game, that this is where the two sides would meet,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIt comes down to having the right people. Ultimately, you need to have zealous advocates for MAGA in position and ready to face off with their counterparts. \u2026 To be sure, this is where all the eyes are going to go next.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe needs additional reinforcements on his team,\u201d Dans said, \u201cas this kind of slows down into a war of attrition with the deep state, particularly on the legal front.\u201d He added: \u201cAs much as he can continue to get his team on the field, that\u2019s imperative.\u201d",
      "Personnel is policy",
      "On his Truth Social platform Monday, Trump posted that his administration has so far hired to fill more than 80% of political appointee positions in some of the largest agencies, including the departments of Justice, State, Defense and Treasury. Those positions make up a small number of the jobs in each agency, but Trump recently moved to reclassify a whole host of federal workers to make them easier to replace.",
      "The administration has already suffered some setbacks in court. The fallout over Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s deportation to El Salvador began when the administration said in court filings that he was deported because of an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d Last week, the administration replaced its lawyers in a case challenging New York City\u2019s congestion pricing, after the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan said it mistakenly filed a memo that detailed weaknesses in the administration\u2019s argument and strategy.",
      "\u201cThis is where the worry comes in,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIs there enough of a MAGA elite among the top legal minds to meet\u201d the administration\u2019s needs?",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really incumbent on the administration to get a lot of these good lawyers who are out in the 50 states, get them to Washington and press them into service,\u201d Dans continued.",
      "Enhancing MAGA staffing has been front of mind for Dans for a long time, given how central deconstructing the existing federal bureaucracy was to Project 2025. That mission has been carried out by Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser who\u2019s overseen the effort dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s elementally important is that Project 2025 identified the administrative state as the major blockade to effectuating change for the better,\u201d Dans said.",
      "The Trump administration hasn\u2019t \u201cfired enough people, to be sure,\u201d he added, describing how difficult it is to do so under existing regulations. With Trump recently moving on the policy known as Schedule F \u2014 the reclassification of some career government employees to make them easier to remove \u2014 Dans said he expects to see \u201ca lot more of this taking place.\u201d",
      "Dans had plenty of praise for Musk and his effort, as the tech titan announced this month that he will soon dedicate more time to his business interests and decrease how much time he\u2019s spending in government.",
      "\u201cWithout DOGE, I don\u2019t believe any of this would be able to be accomplished at the pace it has been,\u201d Dans said, adding its structure remains necessary to achieve Trump\u2019s goals in the months to come. \u201cThis is a great 100-day mark, a watershed moment in history. This is the slamming of the door on the progressive era.\u201d",
      "But Dans did offer some caution on artificial intelligence policy, as Trump has sought to loosen restrictions around AI via executive orders while Musk and DOGE have implemented AI programs at some federal agencies.",
      "\u201cAI has produced this MRI of the blob, and now we can actually make connections that would have been impossible before, in a matter of a weekend, that might have taken two years of study,\u201d Dans said, adding, \u201cBut I do believe that AI needs to be carefully policed by the administration.\u201d",
      "\u2018Short-term pain, but all for long-term gain\u2019",
      "As Trump hits the 100-day mark of his administration, polling is flashing several warning signs for him on signature issues, like immigration and the economy, as deportations to a prison in El Salvador and the president\u2019s global tariffs garner headlines.",
      "Dans, though, says Trump is on target and maintains a mandate for \u201csweeping change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is Trump, unchained and able to do what he promised the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no playbook out there for restoring the country. Much of this is intuitive to him and to others. There are going to be ups and downs. It\u2019s a long-term proposition. So there will be some short-term pain, but all for long-term gain.\u201d",
      "Moving forward, Dans said he\u2019s eager to see more reforms at the Defense Department, including a \u201clarge repurposing\u201d of the agency as it sharpens its focus on Asia, which he believes is coming once there\u2019s a settlement in Ukraine. He also wants to see Trump take action on a policy he proposed during the campaign but has gotten little attention in recent months: the construction of 10 \u201cfreedom cities\u201d on federal land.",
      "\u201cI always thought that was an intriguing Trump idea,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIt captures the imagination of everybody to build something new. He\u2019s a builder. So the first part of building is demolition, but he\u2019s going to get on to the construction phase pretty soon.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead to 2028, Dans said there won\u2019t be a need for a Project 2029.",
      "\u201cWe have President Trump in power now, he has a team,\u201d Dans said. \u201cThe premise of Project 2025 was that we needed, as conservatives, to get together. We were a herd of cats, often scratching at one another, and we needed to kind of start marching in the line. And that\u2019s what Project 2025 did.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I think, not only our initiative, but other presidential transition projects really put this forward that time was of the essence,\u201d Dans continued. \u201cAnd President Trump has certainly come out and played with an urgency that is 100% correct.\u201d"

Daryl Campbell, D-Fl., said during the session. \"But for everyday Floridians, the people who clock in at 6 a.m., who can\u2019t take time off \u2014\u00a0off for their dental visits, who rely on water from their taps to protect their kids, this bill takes a safe and proven and affordable public health tool and rips it away.\"",
      "In a statement, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, D-Fl., said she was \"deeply disappointed\" by the legislature's decision to ban fluoride, which she says \"disregards the overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors, and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health.\"",
      "\"No studies have shown that fluoridation at low levels is unsafe for our communities, including babies and pregnant women \u2014 in fact, it is vitally important for the health of developing teeth in infants and children,\" Cava said, adding that decisions like these should be left to local communities to decide. \"Ending fluoridation will have long-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.\"",
      "Major public health groups, including the\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics, the\u00a0American Dental Association\u00a0and the\u00a0CDC\u00a0\u2014 which says drinking fluoridated water keeps teeth strong and reduces cavities \u2014 support adding the mineral to water.",
      "The anti-fluoridation movement seems to be gaining popularity, especially with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services, who has said there is no \"systemic advantage\u201d to drinking fluoridated water.",
      "Legislation banning fluoride has circulated in\u00a0Kentucky,\u00a0Massachusetts,\u00a0Nebraska, Wisconsin and North Carolina.",
      "Hawaii, which has never mandated water fluoridation, has the \u201chighest prevalence of tooth decay in the United States\u201d among its children, with only 11% of its residents served by a fluoridated community water system, according to\u00a0a 2015 study\u00a0done by the health department on third graders throughout the state."

    "story": [
      "Thousands of people who fled Haiti could be forced back to a country dealing with vast gang violence and political turmoil if a judge clears the runway for the Trump administration to end a Biden-era immigration program.",
      "Kevinson Jean, 28, said receiving a letter from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services informing him that he needed to self-deport was terrifying. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. It felt like a nightmare,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2023, the Jeans were granted entry under Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela (CHNV) Humanitarian Sponsorship Program, which provided temporary legal status for more than 500,000 people to stay in the U.S. An executive order from President Donald Trump revoking the program was to go into effect April 24, with the administration describing the program as a \u201cbroad abuse\u201d of the immigration parole system. A judge temporarily blocked Trump\u2019s order earlier this month. The Trump administration appealed the ruling, and the First Circuit court could rule on the program\u2019s status imminently.",
      "The Jeans\u2019 home country, however, is in the middle of a security and humanitarian crisis. Gangs now control most of Port-au-Prince and violence displaced more than 60,000 people in February alone, according to the United Nations.",
      "Trump told NBC News on April 21, that if the Jeans came to the U.S. \u201clegally, then they\u2019re going to be in good shape\u201d to remain. A statement to NBC News from the Department of Homeland Security described the CHNV program as \u201can unlawful scheme.\u201d",
      "The couple\u2019s journey to the U.S. began in 2019 when Jean befriended Kimberly Snelgrooes, the founder of the nonprofit Christian ministry Hills of His Grace, during a short-term mission trip to Haiti. He began working for the organization, overseeing ministry activities, handling funds and supporting community outreach and humanitarian aid efforts.",
      "The job, though, put a target on his back. Jean said he was held at gunpoint in Port-au-Prince by people demanding cash he had collected for Hills of His Grace\u2019s operations in 2021.",
      "Overall, Jean described the security situation in Haiti as chaotic, citing incidents of gang violence and armed robberies, leaving bodies in the streets. Drone strikes intended to target gangs sometimes hit civilians.",
      "Pierre Esperance, a human rights activist in Haiti, said the country has always had problems, but the current levels of violence are unprecedented.",
      "\u201cGangs are occupying 95% of the capital,\u201d Esperance said. \u201cThey have guns; they have a large presence. They attack whenever they want. They set fire to whatever they want. The police have been weakened, and the government has collapsed.\u201d",
      "The violence led Snelgrooes to help Jean and his wife, Sherlie, apply for the CHNV Humanitarian Sponsorship Program to enter the U.S. The couple made their way to Panhandle, Texas, where the community has rallied around them.",
      "Joshua Light, the pastor of First Baptist Church Panhandle, met Jean in 2020 during a mission trip to Haiti, where Jean worked as a translator. The couple\u2019s kindness left a lasting impression on the pastor.",
      "His church also helped bring the Jeans to the U.S. under humanitarian parole. Now, Light and the congregation are concerned about the possibility of their deportation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. They\u2019ve contributed positively to society, and they want to do everything right,\u201d Light said. \u201cTo target people who have broken no laws for political points is unfair.\u201d",
      "Panhandle is in Carson County, where 90% of voters chose Trump in the 2024 election. Despite the town\u2019s conservative leanings, Light has been vocal in his support for the couple.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a Republican, but I understand that Kevinson and Sherlie are good people who deserve to stay,\u201d he said, emphasizing that compassion should transcend political boundaries.",
      "Without work authorization or a green card, the couple lives in constant fear of deportation. \u201cGoing back to Haiti is like a death sentence,\u201d Jean said, citing the threats he faced due to his former job. \u201cI\u2019ll be a target the moment I land.\u201d",
      "The ongoing instability has made flying to Port-au-Prince, the capital, nearly impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous and very expensive to return,\u201d Jean said. \u201cHow can we self-deport when we don\u2019t even have the means to get back?\u201d",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration suspended U.S. airline flights to Haiti in late 2024 after gangs shot at multiple planes near the airport, including a Spirit Airlines flight. JetBlue and American Airlines also reported their planes were hit by gunfire. Humanitarian flights are limited, and the United Nations has redirected some aid flights to other airports, making it nearly impossible for most people to return to Haiti.",
      "The couple has also expressed concerns about being sent to a third country like El Salvador. \u201cWe don\u2019t know the language or culture. It would be worse than going back to Haiti,\u201d Jean added.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, the Department of Homeland Security said that Haitians in the U.S. who have been ordered to return can go to the northern part of the country, instead of Port-au-Prince, as well as other countries that have agreed to take Haitian migrants.",
      "Light said he worries about the couple\u2019s safety, if forced to return to Haiti. \u201cThey\u2019ve worked so hard to build a life here,\u201d he said, \u201cand for them to be sent back is heartbreaking.\u201d",
      "The Jeans say the thing they want is simple. \u201cWe just want to stay safe,\u201d Jean said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to a war zone.\u201d"

      "Maddock responded on social media later that day, saying Brixie \"keeps trying to get my attention and I keep telling her I\u2019m married.\"",
      "The penalties mean that Brixie cannot deliver official addresses or remarks on the House floor for the time being, and has to park much farther away.",

      "\"I can forgive her for pranking my car, but she should really be sorry for her awful votes that have been ruining Michigan,\" he added.",

      "Jordon Hudson, the 24-year-old who drew national attention Sunday after CBS aired an awkward interview with her boyfriend, 73-year-old former NFL coach Bill Belichick, added another layer of intrigue to the relationship on Tuesday with a post on Instagram.",
      "Hudson posted what appeared to be a screenshot of an email sent by Belichick on April 10. In the email, Belichick expresses frustration with the media tour accompanying the release of his memoir, \u201cThe Art of Winning: Lessons from My Life in Football,\u201d and takes issue with an unspecified news article that highlighted a professional mistake he mentions in the book.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is fantastic, but it probably will hype the book, which is clearly the ongoing theme here,\u201d Belichick wrote. \u201cThis is about what I expected from the media.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis book is about how I did my job, and lessons from my 50 years in and around the NFL \u2014 not a bathroom book that highlights my mistakes,\u201d Belichick added. \u201cI hope we can get on the same page in promoting the book authentically.\u201d",
      "Belichick's email does not specify the professional mistake or the news publication that highlighted it in coverage of his book.",

      "Belichick\u2019s book tour evidently included the interview with \u201cCBS Sunday Morning\u201d that aired on Sunday. In the interview, CBS News journalist Tony Dokoupil asked Belichick how he met Hudson. Hudson, seated off-camera, immediately interjected: \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about this.\u201d",
      "Dokoupil replied: \u201cNo?\u201d",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Hudson said.",
      "The interview quickly went viral online, driving speculation about the origins of the relationship and the nature of Hudson\u2019s role in Belichik\u2019s professional life. In a voiceover track, Dokoupil told viewers that \u201cJordan was a constant presence during our interview.\u201d He quoted Belichick describing Hudson in his memoir as his \u201cidea mill and creative muse.\u201d",
      "Dokoupil also asked Belichick about photos of the couple on Instagram, including a post from October featuring the coach in fisherman\u2019s gear and Hudson dressed like a mermaid. In response, the famously taciturn Belichick said: \u201cI\u2019m on some of those social media platforms, but I honestly don\u2019t follow them.\u201d",
      "CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "NBC Sports has reported that Hudson has \u201ca very active role\u201d in Belichick\u2019s professional life and is \u201cexerting a very high degree of influence.\u201d",
      "Belichick is best known for leading the New England Patriots to six Super Bowl championships. He left the NFL after the 2023 season and, late last year, signed a deal to coach the football team at the University of North Carolina. NBC News has reached out to a spokesman for UNC team."

      "Unlike\u00a0Tesla\u00a0and\u00a0Enphase, Base doesn\u2019t sell home backup batteries. Rather, it rents the batteries to homeowners, providing the hardware, software, installation, operations and electricity. Essentially, it\u2019s a battery-based energy company.",
      "\u201cWe own and operate it,\u201d Dell said. \u201cWe handle all the maintenance. We take care of the system like it\u2019s ours.\u201d",
      "That control allows Base to manipulate how the battery is used, specifically accessing cheaper power and passing that savings on to the consumer. Base charges the battery from the grid when demand is low, typically during overnight hours. When demand is at its peak \u2014 summer evenings and winter mornings \u2014 Base sells power, discharging the battery to support the grid.",
      "For an upfront fee of $595 and then about $19 a month, homeowners get access to reliable power, provided by Base. That power is generated by several sources, including wind, solar, natural gas and coal. About half of Base\u2019s customers have solar, according to the company, which lowers their costs even more and allows them to sell that power back to Base.",
      "A company spokesperson said Base compensates customers for the power they sell back, calculated as the real-time wholesale energy price plus an additional 3 cents per kilowatt hour. Buyback rates may vary depending on market conditions and other factors.",
      "Base is now serving one of the nation\u2019s largest homebuilders,\u00a0Lennar, which is also an investor. Base installs batteries during the construction process in roughly 20 Lennar outage-prone communities in Texas.",
      "Stuart Miller, Chairman and co-CEO of Lennar, said it\u2019s not just about making money.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s, are we going to be able to improve the overall stature of the home building business, as it seeks to address the markets that are stressed and having problems?\u201d he said. \u201cUtilities and electricity is a part of that.\u201d",
      "Base has raised a total of $268 million from investors including Lennar, Thrive Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Andreesen Horowitz.",
      "Base recently announced its first utility partnership near San Antonio. Dell said the company hopes to soon expand outside of Texas. However, the batteries are made in China, and Dell said he expects to see an impact from tariffs.",

    "summary": "The former head of Project 2025 believes an \u201cunchained\u201d President Donald Trump has made immense progress during the first 100 days of his second term toward undoing liberal gains dating back to Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
    "story": [
      "The former head of Project 2025 believes an \u201cunchained\u201d President Donald Trump has made immense progress during the first 100 days of his second term toward undoing liberal gains dating back to Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
      "But Paul Dans \u2014 who led the effort to produce a detailed conservative transition plan and policy blueprint that was at the center of last year\u2019s presidential election \u2014 believes the president needs an influx of new attorneys to fight for his policies in court. Those battles, Dans told NBC News, will shape the next 100 days.",
      "\u201cIf Roosevelt had the New Deal, this is what I would think of as Trump\u2019s real deal,\u201d Dans said. \u201cThis is deconstructing the administrative state and walking back a lot of this progressive architecture that had been built up by FDR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s coming next is really a squaring off with the courts,\u201d Dans said, adding, \u201cThis is going to reach, certainly, a boiling point, and so look to that getting resolved.\u201d",
      "The Dans-led Project 2025 was an effort overseen by the Heritage Foundation ahead of the 2024 campaign, which began with the basic premise of setting up a future right-wing administration to govern on Day 1 with more preparation and planning than Trump had for his first term. Much of Project 2025 centered on plans for radically restructuring the civil service, as well as providing a database of potential MAGA-inspired hires in a new administration.",
      "But it was a 900-plus-page memo, outlining many policy positions a future administration should consider, that garnered the most attention, as Democrats put it at the center of their campaign. Even though many of the policies included in the document mirrored policies Trump pledged to enact in his own plan, Agenda47, the president and his campaign distanced themselves from Project 2025 on the trail. And Dans, who worked in Trump\u2019s first administration, was forced out of his position over the summer as anger from the campaign intensified.",
      "After Trump won, however, he hired multiple authors of the report to key positions, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, immigration czar Tom Homan, top trade adviser Peter Navarro and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, among others. NBC News reported during the transition that the transition team was utilizing the Project 2025 database of potential hires, too.",
      "The blueprint ultimately foreshadowed plenty of what Trump has enacted or attempted once in power. An independent tracker found that the administration has completed or taken action on roughly 40% of the material in Project 2025\u2019s blueprint. That includes everything from cutting research grants to universities to readying cuts for climate research, stripping some immigrants of Temporary Protected Status, and an all-out assault on diversity programs in government.",
      "With that in the foreground as Trump hits the 100-day mark, Dans spoke with NBC News in a pair of interviews in recent days. He doesn\u2019t believe measuring Trump\u2019s actions against Project 2025\u2019s plan \u201cis really accurate,\u201d adding, \u201cthese are, to be sure, President Trump\u2019s own policies, many of which were embodied in Project 2025.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s with great excitement that I read what\u2019s going on every day and see a new step that they\u2019re taking,\u201d Dans said. \u201cBut to be sure, this has to get implemented. At this point, a lot of the executive orders and the like are policy pronouncements, and the real rubber is going to meet the road when it comes to implementing all these directives.\u201d",
      "With a tightly divided Congress passing few new laws, though, a number of Trump\u2019s executive initiatives \u2014\u00a0whether they be on immigration, the civil service or federal funding \u2014\u00a0are tied up in court battles that will be key in determining just how far the president is able to go.",
      "\u201cMany of us always saw this as the ultimate end game, that this is where the two sides would meet,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIt comes down to having the right people. Ultimately, you need to have zealous advocates for MAGA in position and ready to face off with their counterparts. \u2026 To be sure, this is where all the eyes are going to go next.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe needs additional reinforcements on his team,\u201d Dans said, \u201cas this kind of slows down into a war of attrition with the deep state, particularly on the legal front.\u201d He added: \u201cAs much as he can continue to get his team on the field, that\u2019s imperative.\u201d",
      "Personnel is policy",
      "On his Truth Social platform Monday, Trump posted that his administration has so far hired to fill more than 80% of political appointee positions in some of the largest agencies, including the departments of Justice, State, Defense and Treasury. Those positions make up a small number of the jobs in each agency, but Trump recently moved to reclassify a whole host of federal workers to make them easier to replace.",
      "The administration has already suffered some setbacks in court. The fallout over Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s deportation to El Salvador began when the administration said in court filings that he was deported because of an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d Last week, the administration replaced its lawyers in a case challenging New York City\u2019s congestion pricing, after the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan said it mistakenly filed a memo that detailed weaknesses in the administration\u2019s argument and strategy.",
      "\u201cThis is where the worry comes in,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIs there enough of a MAGA elite among the top legal minds to meet\u201d the administration\u2019s needs?",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really incumbent on the administration to get a lot of these good lawyers who are out in the 50 states, get them to Washington and press them into service,\u201d Dans continued.",
      "Enhancing MAGA staffing has been front of mind for Dans for a long time, given how central deconstructing the existing federal bureaucracy was to Project 2025. That mission has been carried out by Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser who\u2019s overseen the effort dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s elementally important is that Project 2025 identified the administrative state as the major blockade to effectuating change for the better,\u201d Dans said.",
      "The Trump administration hasn\u2019t \u201cfired enough people, to be sure,\u201d he added, describing how difficult it is to do so under existing regulations. With Trump recently moving on the policy known as Schedule F \u2014 the reclassification of some career government employees to make them easier to remove \u2014 Dans said he expects to see \u201ca lot more of this taking place.\u201d",
      "Dans had plenty of praise for Musk and his effort, as the tech titan announced this month that he will soon dedicate more time to his business interests and decrease how much time he\u2019s spending in government.",
      "\u201cWithout DOGE, I don\u2019t believe any of this would be able to be accomplished at the pace it has been,\u201d Dans said, adding its structure remains necessary to achieve Trump\u2019s goals in the months to come. \u201cThis is a great 100-day mark, a watershed moment in history. This is the slamming of the door on the progressive era.\u201d",
      "But Dans did offer some caution on artificial intelligence policy, as Trump has sought to loosen restrictions around AI via executive orders while Musk and DOGE have implemented AI programs at some federal agencies.",
      "\u201cAI has produced this MRI of the blob, and now we can actually make connections that would have been impossible before, in a matter of a weekend, that might have taken two years of study,\u201d Dans said, adding, \u201cBut I do believe that AI needs to be carefully policed by the administration.\u201d",
      "\u2018Short-term pain, but all for long-term gain\u2019",
      "As Trump hits the 100-day mark of his administration, polling is flashing several warning signs for him on signature issues, like immigration and the economy, as deportations to a prison in El Salvador and the president\u2019s global tariffs garner headlines.",
      "Dans, though, says Trump is on target and maintains a mandate for \u201csweeping change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is Trump, unchained and able to do what he promised the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no playbook out there for restoring the country. Much of this is intuitive to him and to others. There are going to be ups and downs. It\u2019s a long-term proposition. So there will be some short-term pain, but all for long-term gain.\u201d",
      "Moving forward, Dans said he\u2019s eager to see more reforms at the Defense Department, including a \u201clarge repurposing\u201d of the agency as it sharpens its focus on Asia, which he believes is coming once there\u2019s a settlement in Ukraine. He also wants to see Trump take action on a policy he proposed during the campaign but has gotten little attention in recent months: the construction of 10 \u201cfreedom cities\u201d on federal land.",
      "\u201cI always thought that was an intriguing Trump idea,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIt captures the imagination of everybody to build something new. He\u2019s a builder. So the first part of building is demolition, but he\u2019s going to get on to the construction phase pretty soon.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead to 2028, Dans said there won\u2019t be a need for a Project 2029.",
      "\u201cWe have President Trump in power now, he has a team,\u201d Dans said. \u201cThe premise of Project 2025 was that we needed, as conservatives, to get together. We were a herd of cats, often scratching at one another, and we needed to kind of start marching in the line. And that\u2019s what Project 2025 did.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I think, not only our initiative, but other presidential transition projects really put this forward that time was of the essence,\u201d Dans continued. \u201cAnd President Trump has certainly come out and played with an urgency that is 100% correct.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Ed Martin, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia on a permanent basis, dodged questions about his views on Jan. 6 and his prior criticism of Republican politicians in written answers to the Senate Judiciary Committee as part of his confirmation process.",
      "Martin, a longtime conservative activist who became a \"Stop the Steal\" advocate after the 2020 election, was named by Trump as acting U.S. attorney in D.C. on Inauguration Day. Senate Democrats as well as career federal prosecutors have raised alarms about Martin\u2019s nomination to the post, citing his lack of experience, his past controversial comments and the politicized approach he has taken since taking over the job on an interim basis.",
      "If Martin is still the interim U.S. attorney on May 20 and hasn\u2019t been confirmed by the Senate, the federal court in Washington will appoint someone to fill the role until Trump\u2019s nominee for the position is confirmed.",
      "A copy of Martin\u2019s answers to questions for the record in his confirmation process was obtained by NBC News. In the document, Martin also distanced himself from Jan. 6 defendant Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, a man the government portrayed as Nazi sympathizer during the course of his case. He was sentenced to four years in prison in 2022 and was among those pardoned by Trump this year.",
      "Martin called Hale-Cusanelli an \"extraordinary leader\" when giving him an award last year. Martin has interviewed him four times, though the Trump nominee said in his written answers he could only recall one interview with Hale-Cusanelli and declined to say when he last spoke with him.",
      "Martin also declined to answer a question on whether he'd ever stated or suggested the Jan. 6 attack was \"deliberately planned, premeditated, or organized by the FBI,\" citing an investigation he launched into his predecessors\u2019 handling of an obstruction charge used against Jan. 6 defendants and Justice Department policy against commenting on ongoing matters. Martin previously represented Jan. 6 defendants and was a board member of an organization founded by Hale-Cusanelli's aunt. Multiple Jan. 6 prosecutors have been fired and others were demoted in the time since he took over the U.S. attorney's office.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that Martin had repeatedly avoided answering the questions from the committee.",
      "\u201cOverall, these responses, which are under oath, leave me with even more questions and further underscore the need to hear live testimony from Ed Martin at a hearing,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cMr. Martin makes a number of false statements that are easily debunked and dodges at least 80 questions outright, stating he doesn\u2019t \u2018recall\u2019 the answer to a question more than 39 times, \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 more than 21 times, and some variation of \u2018can\u2019t discuss this matter\u2019 more than 20 times.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said the committee will not be holding a confirmation hearing for Martin, citing \u201clongtime committee precedent.\u201d The spokesperson said once all of Martin\u2019s background materials are in, the committee would move to list him on the agenda for a committee vote, a process that typically takes weeks with controversial nominees.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.,\u00a0has placed a hold on Martin\u2019s nomination and said he\u2019ll \u201cblock attempts to jam through his appointment at every stage.\u201d",
      "Martin did not respond to a request for comment on Durbin\u2019s criticism of his answers to the committee.",
      "Ahead of the May 20 deadline, when Martin's interim status will expire, some of the questions sent by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee seemed specifically designed to pick off Republican votes. The questions pointed out that Martin has called for primary challenges against GOP Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and John Curtis of Utah, and has criticized Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and his wife, former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, claiming they enriched themselves during their service in government. Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate.",
      "Curtis told NBC News that he found Martin's comments \u2014 that Curtis was one of the \"traitors to the life position\" in Congress who should be challenged in a primary \u2014 \"almost funny,\" adding that they wouldn't influence his vote. \"But his qualifications will,\" Curtis said.",
      "Curtis said that he'd be spending time looking at Martin's interactions with Jan. 6 defendants and that Martin's background for the position gave him pause.",
      "\u201cPause is a good word,\" Curtis said. \"But look, I\u2019m just spending a little bit more time with it, to see what it was, what it wasn\u2019t.",
      "Relationship with Jan. 6 defendant under scrutiny",
      "Martin was a member of the Patriot Freedom Project, which supported Jan. 6 defendants, and received $30,000 for being on the board, according to his financial filing. The group was founded by Cynthia Hughes, Hale-Cusanelli's aunt.",
      "Martin said in response to questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee that he did not recall when he first made contact with Hale-Cusanelli and said he was \"not close\" with him and did not have \"close, consistent interactions\" with the man. Martin said he condemned Hale-Cusanelli's remarks \u201cin the strongest terms possible\u201d and that he was not aware of Hale-Cusanelli's comments and views until after Hale-Cusanelli received his award.",
      "During an interview with Hale-Cusanelli in June 2024, Martin referenced photos that came up in Hale-Cusanelli's criminal case, in which he had a mustache that made him resemble Adolph Hitler. Martin said in the interview that Hale-Cusanelli was \"making jokes about it\" and that it was not his best moment but it was not illegal.",
      "The photo of Hale-Cusanelli was referenced throughout his criminal case, and the evidence about Hale-Cusanelli's other comments has long been public. In a 2021 filing just days after the Jan. 6 attack, the Justice Department called Hale-Cusanelli \"an avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer,\" and noted that federal agents recovered a copy of Hitler's manifesto and a novel written by a white nationalist leader.",
      "At his sentencing hearing after a jury trial, a federal judge dismissed the defendant's attempts to downplay the photo, saying the broader evidence of Hale-Cusanelli's beliefs were clear. Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden called Hale-Cusanelli's testimony \"highly dubious\" and dismissed Hale-Cusanelli's attempts to portray a photo of him wearing a Hitler mustache as a joke, that the \"evidence shows otherwise\" and that it was abundantly clear the defendant had \"sexist, racist and antisemitic\" views."

      "President Donald Trump has moved with remarkable speed in his first 100 days, issuing more than 100 executive orders and pushing an agenda that has the potential to rapidly remake America.",
      "That effort comes from some big promises he made on the campaign trail, including to implement tariffs, carry out mass deportations and end major international conflicts.",
      "Here's a look at many of those promises and whether or not he's followed through:",
      "Promise: End war in Ukraine on or before Day 1",
      "During his 721-day campaign, Trump consistently promised to end the war in Ukraine.\u00a0At times, he even went as far as to add that he would end the conflict in 24 hours.",
      "\u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the disastrous war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\u201d he told a rally crowd in Waco, Texas in March 2023, adding, \u201cI will have that settlement done within 24 hours.\u201d",
      "In an interview with former Navy SEAL Shawn Ryan\u2019s podcast in August 2024, he said, \u201cI will have that war settled when I\u2019m president-elect, meaning before I get to office on Jan. 20.\u201d",
      "One-hundred days into Trump's second term, the conflict grinds on. In a recent interview with Time magazine, Trump claimed that his campaign rhetoric about the conflict was an \u201cexaggeration and \"was said in jest.\"",
      "In one of the more memorable days of this administration, Trump and Vice President Vance berated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, calling him ungrateful and saying he \u201cdisrespected\u201d the U.S.",
      "Still, the president acknowledged during that meeting that ending the war in Ukraine, which has waged for over three years, would be \u201ca very great achievement if we could get this war stopped, and get them back to normalization.\u201d",
      "Promise: End the war in Gaza",
      "Since Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Trump maintained that the attack would not have taken place had he been president at the time. Throughout the campaign, he kept in contact with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even hosting him at his home in Mar-a-Lago last July.\u00a0And on several occasions, especially when speaking to predominantly Jewish audiences, he promised he would \u201cbring peace back to the Middle East.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get it to work out,\u201d he told the Israeli-American Council in Washington, D.C. in September. \u201cI\u2019m the candidate of those who want to defend Western civilization, defend Israel and defend the United States of America. When I return to the White House, we will quickly restore stability in the Middle East, and we will return the world to peace.\u201d",
      "The beginning of 2025 showed promise; before President Trump was sworn in, he dispatched his special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, to work with President Joe Biden\u2019s chief negotiator, Brett McGurk. A three-phase ceasefire deal was agreed to on Jan. 15, with Trump, then the president-elect, taking a victory lap.",
      "The deal lasted until March 18, when Israel launched a surprise attack on Gaza and Netayahu announced that Israel had \u201cresumed combat in full force\u201c against Hamas.",
      "On April 7, during an event with Netanyahu, Trump indicated that the negotiators were close to a deal saying, \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to see the war stop, and I think the war will stop at some point. That won\u2019t be in the too distant future. Right now, we have a problem with hostages. We\u2019re trying to get the hostages out. We got quite a few of them out, but it\u2019s a long process. It shouldn\u2019t be that long.\u201d",
      "Thirty-three Israeli hostages and 1,800 Palestinians were returned during the ceasefire earlier this year; 59 Israelis taken since the start of the Oct. 7 conflict remain in captivity. The Palestinian death toll since the start of the Israel-Hamas war stands at 52,243, according to the Gaza Health Ministry; the Israeli death toll is roughly 1,200 people killed, according to Israeli Foreign Ministry, and 251 people taken hostage.",
      "Promise: Close the border",
      "Immigration has long been one of Trump\u2019s top issues in his campaigns. Throughout the 2024 race, Trump laid out various initiatives aimed at decreasing illegal immigration and the number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. But largely, his agenda started with sealing the border \u2014 particularly the southern border with Mexico.",
      "Trump held more events focused on immigration than any other one topic, including the economy. At a rally in Aurora, Colo. on Oct. 11, he said, \u201cWe will close the border. We will stop the invasion of illegals into our country. We will defend our territory. We will not be conquered. We will not be conquered. We will reclaim our sovereignty.\u201d",
      "According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, illegal crossings are at a historic low, dropping from 211,896 in March 2022 to 8,193 in March 2025, a 96% decrease, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.",
      "Most recently, Trump took to Truth Social to highlight his accomplishment, writing, \u201cTHE SOUTHERN BORDER IS NOW THE STRONGEST AND SAFEST IN USA HISTORY. IT WILL REMAIN SO!!!\u201d and noting \u201cI beat my own record\u201d during an event on April 22, 2025.",
      "Promise: Carry out the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history",
      "Carrying out mass deportations was a cornerstone of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, even though he never provided any specifics on how such an operation would be implemented or paid for.",
      "\"I will send Congress a bill to ban all sanctuary cities in our country, including Denver, and we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States,\" Trump said at a rally in Aurora, Colo. in October.",
      "On Oct. 27, just days before the election, Trump reiterated during a rally in New York City, \u201cOn day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out.\u201d",
      "While the administration did begin deportation operations almost immediately, Trump\u2019s deportation numbers have been lower than that of both Biden and Barack Obama during the same time period in their presidencies. But that is largely because the number of border encounters has been significantly lower.",
      "According to Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, the administration has deported approximately 139,000 people as of April 28.",
      "Trump is also facing multiple legal challenges to his deportation orders, many of which have been stayed by the Supreme Court or other federal courts.",
      "Homan told NBC News on April 28 that he needs more funding from Congress to carry out the president\u2019s vision.",
      "\u201cWe need more, more money for beds. We need more money for more officers. We need more money for contractors that come in and do non enforcement jobs and release the law enforcement officers to the street. We need more plane flights. So Congress needs to come through and fund us to keep President Trump\u2019s promise to the American people,\u201d Homan said.",
      "Promise: End birthright citizenship",
      "In 2023, the president put out a video proposing an end to birthright citizenship and banning what he called \u201cbirth tourism.\u201d",
      "\u201cOn Day One of my new term in office,\u201d he promised, \u201cI will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward, the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic U.S. citizenship.\u201d",
      "The president signed an executive order ending birthright citizenship on his first day in office. But the order almost immediately faced legal challenges, three of which have made it to the Supreme Court. Arguments will be presented on May 15.",
      "Still, the president has expressed confidence that the order will ultimately be upheld.",
      "\u201cI just think that we\u2019ll end up winning that court, in the Supreme Court. I think we\u2019re going to win that case, and I look forward to winning it,\u201d he said in the Oval Office in late January. \u201c We\u2019re the only country in the world that does this. There\u2019s no other country at this level. There\u2019s no other country in the world that does it. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d",
      "At least four lower-court judges have blocked Trump\u2019s plan.",
      "Promise: Impose tariffs and improve the economy",
      "Trump thinks \u201ctariff\u201d is a beautiful word. He said so, repeatedly, during the campaign.",
      "\u201cThe word tariff, properly used, is\u2026 one of the most beautiful words I\u2019ve ever heard. It\u2019s music to my ears,\u201d he said at a rally in Savannah, Ga. on Sept. 24.",
      "It was part of his effort to convince voters that imposing tariffs would help bring back American manufacturing and create jobs.",
      "\u201cAnd it will not cause inflation, by the way,\u201d he often added, like he did at during the speech in Savannah.",
      "Trump often oscillated on specifics of his tariff plan, at times promising he would impose an 100% tariff on all cars from Mexico, while at other times proposing 10%-20% tariffs across the board.",
      "At a speech in York, Pa. on Aug. 19, 2024, Trump claimed that imposing tariffs \u2014 \u201ca small 10% tariff\u201d \u2014 on foreign imports would \u201callow massive tax cuts for working families, create more than three million American jobs and raise household incomes by 6%.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs have been a rollercoaster. Trump imposed tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China.\u00a0Then he imposed more tariffs on steel and aluminum. Then he paused the tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Then he unpaused them. Then he imposed reciprocal tariffs. Then he rolled them back but increased the tariffs on China.",
      "During his address to Congress in early March, he acknowledged that there would be some pain before the economy adjusted to the tariffs: \u201cTariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again, and it\u2019s happening, and it will happen rather quickly. There\u2019ll be a little disturbance, but we\u2019re okay with that. It won\u2019t be much.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s been more than a \"little disturbance\"; his first 100 days have been the worst for the stock market since Richard Nixon\u2019s presidency, with a cliff dive around April 2, Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d",
      "Promise: End inflation and lower prices",
      "Flanked by groceries on either side of the podium, Trump summoned the campaign press corps and a small group of supporters to his club in New Jersey in August to tell them: \u201cWhen I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One.\u201d",
      "Just a few days later, in York, Pa., he told a large rally crowd that \u201cthis will help us quickly defeat inflation and make America affordable again.\u201d",
      "It was a promise he made in most of his economic-focused speeches, especially towards the end of the campaign when many voters said the economy and prices were their main concern.",
      "During his 100 days in office, inflation has cooled from 3% to 2.4%.\u00a0 However, the tariffs and unruly markets have made economists jittery. Prices, especially at the grocery store, have continued to rise, especially due to the tariffs on imported foods. Consumer confidence hit a 12-year low in March.",
      "Trump nevertheless projected confidence at a Rose Garden event on April 2, the day he imposed reciprocal tariffs.",
      "\u201cGroceries went through the roof and I campaigned on that. I talked about the word groceries for a lot. And energy costs now are down. Groceries are down. Gasoline is way under $3 and people are beginning to be able to buy things and live again. We brought prices way down,\u201d he said.",
      "The numbers tell a different story.\u00a0The rate of inflation has decreased from 3% in January to 2.4% in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prices, however, have either increased or stayed relatively the same. The average price of eggs increased from $4.95 in January to $6.22 in March.\u00a0The average price of bacon dropped $0.70 from January 2025 to March. And the price of gas has stayed relatively flat, increasing just $0.20 from January-March.",
      "Promise: Making government more efficient",
      "At a speech to the Economic Club of New York in September, Trump announced that he would create a government efficiency commission \u2014 an idea first floated by billionaire tech executive Elon Musk \u2014 that would be \u201cconducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs the first order of business,\u201d he added, \u201cthis commission will develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months. This will save trillions of dollars trillions.\u201d",
      "The commission became a reality with DOGE (the Department of Government Efficiency), which was one of the splashiest and most attention-grabbing initiatives of Trump\u2019s first 100 days. The savings, however, have been far from the $2 trillion initially promised.",
      "According to DOGE\u2019s website, it estimated $160 billion in savings, just 8% of its original goal. But that estimate may be inflated, given that DOGE\u2019s reporting has been riddled with errors and misleading claims.",
      "Those figures also don\u2019t take into account the expenses associated with DOGE\u2019s work, including legal fees, salaries and money spent on carrying out some of the massive changes \u2014 such as when the U.S. Department of Agriculture accidentally fired and tried to rehire workers who were crafting the response to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak.",
      "The cuts also don\u2019t factor in that Musk\u2019s basket of policy proposals would actually add to the deficit, according to budget experts.",
      "Musk\u2019s sledgehammer approach to restructuring the government through layoffs and the elimination of entire agencies within departments has created significant confusion and uncertainty, with workers\u2019 job status and mission often changing.\u00a0Many of DOGE\u2019s actions have been challenged and are awaiting rulings in courts.",
      "During a press conference in the Oval Office, in which Trump claimed billions had been found in savings through DOGE, Musk defended his department\u2019s actions saying, \u201cThe people voted for major government reform. There should be no doubt about that. That was on the campaign. The president spoke about that at every rally, the people voted for major government reform, and that\u2019s what people are going to get. They\u2019re going to get what they voted for.\u201d",
      "Promise: Banning transgender athletes in women's sports",
      "Every time Trump declared, \u201cI will keep men out of women\u2019s sports,\u201d at his campaign rallies, it was his largest applause line.",
      "In early February, Trump signed an executive order banning transgender women and girls from competing in women's sports. It was the fourth executive order targeting transgender people he signed after he was inaugurated.",
      "The NCAA \u2014 a nonprofit organization that regulates student athletics among 1,100 colleges and universities across the U.S. \u2014 quickly complied with the order.",
      "\u201cNo matter how many surgeries you have or chemicals you inject, if you\u2019re born with male DNA in every cell of your body, you can never become a woman. You\u2019re not going to be a woman. And that\u2019s why last month, I proudly signed a historic executive order to ban men from competing in women\u2019s sports and it was very popular \u2014 very, very popular,\u201d he said at a Women\u2019s History Month event in March.",
      "The order, however, is facing legal challenges after the state of Maine refused to comply with it. When the administration pulled educational funding due to the state\u2019s refusal, the governor sued the administration. The lawsuit is still pending.",
      "Promise: Eliminating the Department of Education",
      "\u201cReturning education to the states\u201d and giving more control to parents was a policy Trump often repeated on the campaign trail.",
      "\u201cI want to close the Department of Education and move education back to the states with the law, and where parents have total control of their children\u2019s lives,\u201d Trump said at a Turning Point Action summit in West Palm Beach in July 2023.",
      "The president has slashed the Department of Education \u2014 implementing mass layoffs, pulling funding and cutting programs \u2014 but it requires an act of Congress to eliminate the department fully.",
      "While Trump claimed that he signed an executive order \u201celiminating the Department of Education once and for all,\u201d he later couched the statement saying, \u201cAnd I think it won\u2019t be that long before the states will be really running the Department of Education...So I think you\u2019re going to see a tremendous change very quickly, having to do with education.\u201d",
      "Promise: IVF coverage",
      "Trump told NBC News in August that he was going to provide government coverage for IVF treatments.",
      "\u201cWe are going to be, under the Trump administration, we are going to be paying for that treatment,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be mandating that the insurance company pay.\u201d",
      "He failed to provide any specifics on how this policy would be implemented or how it would be paid for.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order directing his policy team to provide policy recommendations on how to protect IVF and reduce out-of-pocket costs for the treatment within 90 days. But he has yet to announce any of the recommendations to implement a plan. Those lack of specifics didn\u2019t stop him from referring himself as \u201cthe fertilization president\u201d at a Women\u2019s History Event at the White House in March.",
      "Promise: Pardoning Jan. 6 rioters",
      "The first indication that President Trump would pardon convicted Jan. 6 rioters was in March 2023, when he played a version of the \u201cStar Spangled Banner\u201d recorded by the \u201cJ6 choir\u201d \u2014 a group of Jan. 6 defendants who were incarcerated and awaiting trial \u2014 at his rally in Waco, Texas.",
      "For a few months, he and his campaign hedged on the topic, saying they would consider each individual case. But then roughly a year later, Trump confirmed his commitment to pardons, posting on Truth Social, \u201cMy first acts as your next President will be to Close the Border, DRILL, BABY, DRILL, and Free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!\u201d",
      "In July, at a panel hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists, Trump also said, \u201cI absolutely would\u201d when asked if he would pardon the Jan. 6 rioters.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re innocent, I would pardon them,\u201d he continued. One of the moderators, ABC News\u2019 Rachel Scott, pushed back saying, \u201cThey\u2019ve been convicted.\u201d",
      "On his first day in office, Trump issued roughly 1,500 pardons and commutations of his supporters in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Promise: Ending DEI in government",
      "In an early campaign video, Trump claimed that Biden was \"weaponizing every tool of government power to push this racism and this Communism and Marxism.\"",
      "\"I will instruct the Department of Justice to make clear that any such discrimination is completely and totally illegal,\" he added, \"and to investigate the unlawful domination and discrimination and civil right abuses carried out by the Biden administration.\u201d",
      "Trump bashed diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, promising to end related hiring practices and trainings in government.",
      "Trump has signed various executive orders eliminating DEI programs at different agencies. One order directed \u201call departments and agencies to take strong action to end private sector DEI discrimination, including civil compliance investigations.\"\u00a0The administration has targeted nearly 50 companies that it deemed to be in violation of its anti-DEI rules, according to a Bloomberg report.",
      "Most recently, on March 18, he directed the Department of Education to end all its DEI initiatives.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve ended all of the so-called Diversity Equity and Inclusion programs across the entire federal government and the private sector and notified every single government DEI officer that their job has been deleted. They\u2019re gone. They\u2019re fired,\u201d he boasted at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February.",
      "Trump has also issued executive orders taking aim at private institutions \u2014 including universities and law firms \u2014 and pressuring them to end DEI practices.",
      "A number of companies have complied with his orders."

    "story": [
      "The owner of an Idaho bar and restaurant plans to host a two-day \u201cHetero Awesome Fest\u201d outside of the state Capitol in Boise in June to coincide with LGBTQ Pride Month.",
      "Mark Fitzpatrick, the owner of the Old State Saloon in Eagle, a suburb of Boise, said the event was inspired by the restaurant\u2019s inaugural \u201cHeterosexual Awesomeness Month,\u201d held last June in response to Pride celebrations.",
      "Hetero Awesome Fest will be held June 20 and 21 in Cecil D. Andrus Park, directly across the street from the Capitol, and will feature live music, speakers \u201cwho are on the front lines defending traditional family values\u201d and local food and drink vendors, according to a social media video promoting the event.",
      "\u201cThis festival is more than just an event,\u201d a voiceover on the video said. \u201cIt\u2019s a declaration that faith, family and freedom are worth protecting.\u201d",
      "The event is seeking bands, volunteers, vendors and sponsors \u201cwho share our visions.\u201d",
      "\"The Hetero Awesome Fest and Heterosexual Awesomeness Month aim to celebrate the traditional family unit and address concerns about cultural trends influenced by liberal progressivism,\" Fitzpatrick, who has owned the bar for two years, told NBC News in an email. \"Our event is not about targeting any group but about raising awareness of practices we find troubling, such as the encouragement of 'gender transitions' among children or their exposure to inappropriate content.\"",
      "He added, \"We believe the traditional family is vital to society and deserves recognition and protection.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick, 47, said he has six children, including one adopted child, with his wife of 22 years.",
      "Fitzpatrick has said on social media that Pride Month exists \u201cso LGBTQ can march down the street doing disgusting and criminal activities while demanding to be celebrated,\u201d and that the community \u201cencourages children to cut off their sex organs.\u201d",
      "He said in a video shared last week on the bar\u2019s Instagram account that he had reached out to a number of corporations who have donated to LGBTQ Pride celebrations over the years to ask if they would support the event, and they told him they typically only donate to registered nonprofits. As a result, he said, he created the nonprofit Heterosexual Awesomeness Inc., which will host the festival, though he hasn\u2019t heard back from any major donors yet.",
      "Fitzpatrick received international attention and backlash last year in response to \u201cHeterosexual Awesomeness Month,\u201d which he said at the time involved \u201cno hate at all, it\u2019s a love thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always going to side with what God says,\u201d Fitzpatrick told KTVB-TV, an NBC affiliate in Boise, last year. \u201cIf the Bible says that it\u2019s a sin to act out in homosexuality, then I\u2019m going to agree with what the Bible says. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love homosexuals, and that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love people. But just because you love somebody, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to jump behind them and support them in every single decision they make in life. It\u2019s not a requirement.\u201d",
      "Fitzpatrick said on social media that he was inspired to create Heterosexual Awesomeness Month last year when he and his family were discussing how they would celebrate his daughter\u2019s birthday in June.",
      "\u201cCan\u2019t go downtown to Boise during that time because of Pride Fest and everything that happens with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI got off track from the birthday, and I was thinking to myself, \u2018What could we do to celebrate in June that would be different than what\u2019s going on downtown? Can we be different than what Pride has been celebrating every June? What if we celebrated God\u2019s design for sexuality? What would that look like?\u2019 And within a few seconds, I thought, \u2018Man, heterosexuality is awesome.\u2019\u201d",
      "Fitzpatrick said last year that he had never been to Boise Pride. The festival hasn\u2019t been held in June since 2020, when organizers rescheduled it for September due to the pandemic and decided to permanently adopt the change due to better weather, among other factors.",
      "Regardless, Fitzpatrick said he had decided that the Old State Saloon would celebrate heterosexuality throughout June with a variety of specials. On Mondays, straight men can get a free beer during \u201cBeers for Breeders.\u201d On Tuesdays, straight women can buy drinks all day at happy hour pricing, and on Wednesdays, straight couples can receive a discount on their bill.",
      "After last year\u2019s Heterosexual Awesomeness Month went viral, Fitzpatrick said he received death threats, but that the positivity was \u201coverwhelmingly more powerful.\u201d",
      "Boise Pride told KGW-TV, an NBC affiliate based in Portland, Oregon, that it has no official statement regarding this year\u2019s Hetero Awesome Fest, but wished the organizers \u201cthe best of luck with their new festival.\u201d",
      "\u201cStraight pride\u201d supporters organized events in Boston and Modesto, California, in 2019, and last year several businesses in Santa Rosa, California, were vandalized with anti-LGBTQ flyers that provided a link to a rap song about \u201cstraight pride.\u201d",
      "LGBTQ Pride events, which trace their roots to 1970, have faced intense backlash in recent years. GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization, recorded 110 anti-LGBTQ incidents during June 2024, though the nonprofit noted that number was down 25% when compared to Pride 2023. Organizers of some of the country\u2019s largest Pride parades have also reported that some of their biggest sponsors have pulled back this year amid the Trump administration\u2019s policies targeting DEI initiatives."

      "A new private membership club in Washington, D.C., co-founded by Donald Trump Jr., is charging a $500,000 membership fee \u2014 and there\u2019s already a waiting list.",
      "The club, called Executive Branch, held a launch party on Saturday night that included at least a half dozen members of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration as well as wealthy CEOs, tech founders and policy experts, according to people familiar with the club who declined to be named speaking about it publicly.",
      "Executive Branch was founded by Donald Trump Jr., along with Omeed Malik and Christopher Buskirk of 1789 Capital, the investment firm that made Trump Jr. a partner last year. Other founders include Alex Witkoff and Zach Witkoff, the sons of billionaire real estate developer Steve Witkoff, a longtime friend of the President\u2019s and the current Middle East envoy.",
      "Founding members include White House crypto czar David Sacks, crypto investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya, the people familiar told CNBC.",
      "In addition to the $500,000 membership fee, the club will charge annual dues, which have yet to be disclosed.",
      "Executive Branch will open sometime in the next month or so at a location in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., those people said.",
      "Executive Branch is the latest in a wave of private membership clubs that have opened since the Covid pandemic in cities like New York, Miami and Los Angeles. The clubs offer exclusive restaurants and bars, along with meeting spaces, gyms and spas and typically come with membership fees of roughly $4,000 to $10,000. Some, like the Aman Club in New York, for example, run as high as $200,000.",
      "Executive Branch, at more than double the Aman Club\u2019s cost, will be far and away one of the most expensive membership clubs in the U.S. And unlike popular membership clubs in New York, like Zero Bond, Core Club, ZZ\u2019s or Casa Cipriani, Executive Branch will likely have a select and smaller membership, according to people familiar with the club.",

      "Lawmakers in Florida gave final passage to a bill banning fluoride in public water systems on Tuesday, with the state House voting 88 yay and 27 nay.",
      "SB 700, also known as the Florida Farm Bill, doesn't mention the word \"fluoride,\" but would effectively ban the chemical compound by preventing \"the use of certain additives in a water system.\" The bill now awaits Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 signature.",

      "During a Florida House session Tuesday, lawmakers in support of the bill argued that fluoride does not improve water quality and removing it from water systems could save local governments money. Opponents of the bill argued that everyday Floridians rely on fluoride for dental health.",
      "\"This bill doesn\u2019t hurt the wealthy. They\u2019ll keep seeing private dentists, getting their expensive treatments and flashing their perfect smiles,\" Rep. Daryl Campbell, D-Fl., said during the session. \"But for everyday Floridians, the people who clock in at 6 a.m., who can\u2019t take time off \u2014\u00a0off for their dental visits, who rely on water from their taps to protect their kids, this bill takes a safe and proven and affordable public health tool and rips it away.\"",
      "In a statement, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, D-Fl., said she was \"deeply disappointed\" by the legislature's decision to ban fluoride, which she says \"disregards the overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors, and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health.\"",
      "\"No studies have shown that fluoridation at low levels is unsafe for our communities, including babies and pregnant women \u2014 in fact, it is vitally important for the health of developing teeth in infants and children,\" Cava said, adding that decisions like these should be left to local communities to decide. \"Ending fluoridation will have long-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.\"",
      "Major public health groups, including the\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics, the\u00a0American Dental Association\u00a0and the\u00a0CDC\u00a0\u2014 which says drinking fluoridated water keeps teeth strong and reduces cavities \u2014 support adding the mineral to water.",
      "The anti-fluoridation movement seems to be gaining popularity, especially with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services, who has said there is no \"systemic advantage\u201d to drinking fluoridated water.",

      "What followed was a six-year long court battle between the two in which Brinkley publicly called Cook a narcissist, which she writes inspired others moms to leave their own narcissistic husbands.",

He admitted he's a narcissist, saying it \"makes you focus attention on something\" which helped him be a better dad. He also claimed that Brinkley lied about \u201cvirtually everything\u201d she said on the show.",

      "It\u2019s all in the title: This new show will take a completely different approach to wardrobe transformation. This time around, there\u2019s no secret filming of unwitting style offenders, no ambush makeovers and zero outfit shaming.",
      "Instead, the new show is about empowering people to discover and embrace their unique style, even if their dream looks don\u2019t follow any conventional fashion guidelines.",
      "\u201cWe are no longer applying rules that come from our perspective,\u201d London tells TODAY.com. \u201cWe are asking our clients what their dream style is, why they haven\u2019t been able to achieve it and really help them along the way and guide them, rather than make it about geometry or looking thinner.\u201d",
      "A new premise...",
      "London says she and Kelly don\u2019t see themselves as style experts but as \u201cfairy godmothers,\u201d helping people express themselves through fashion.",
      "That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s anything wrong with some good old color, texture, pattern and shine \u2014 or that \u201cWhat Not to Wear\u201d standby, the pointy-toe shoe.",
      "It\u2019s just that now, London and Kelly are digging a little deeper.",
      "\u201cLike, pointy-toe shoes do make your legs look longer, but why do you want to wear a pointy-toe shoe? What\u2019s the style that you\u2019re going for? What do you want to communicate to other people?\u201d London says. \u201cSo we talk to them pretty significantly about what\u2019s holding them back psychologically.\u201d",
      "Eight clients from all walks of life nominated themselves for the show\u2019s first season, which premiered on Prime Video April 29, including a young mom hoping to reclaim her style identity, a grandmother and breast cancer survivor discovering her \"inner diva\u201d and a young transgender man exploring style identity.",
      "In each episode, the client puts together their own dream outfits from a curated closet, then road tests the looks at an event in the real world. All the while, Kelly and London are rooting them on without judgment.",
      "\u201cOur job was to make it as safe as possible, and we were there every step of the way,\u201d Kelly tells TODAY.com.",
      "After clients try out their initial fantasy looks, they have the opportunity to refine their style further and to brainstorm with Kelly and London what outfits might work for them in their daily lives.",
      "This process of collaboration with each client is \u201ca lot closer to what stylists do in real life,\u201d Kelly says.",
      "... And a long-awaited reunion",
      "With their bubbly on-screen chemistry, the co-hosts seem to be picking up right where they left off from their \u201cWhat Not to Wear\u201d days.",

      "\u201cFor the first five years we worked together, I either adored her or despised her, and never anything in between,\u201d he wrote at the time.",

      "The same year, London blocked Kelly on Twitter, which Kelly said at the time felt like \u201cgetting a little slap in the face.\u201d",
      "But all that is clearly behind them now. The pair announced their reconciliation in 2023 and said they had worked through any sticking points in their relationship.",
      "\u201cSo I reached out to Stacy and I was like, \u2018Can we put this behind us? Let\u2019s talk it out.\u2019 And we had a really emotional conversation. It was during the pandemic, sort of as the pandemic was ending. And we just talked through it all,\u201d Kelly said during a joint visit to TODAY with London in September 2023.",

      "Kody Brown's ex-wives have long considered Robyn Brown to be his strongest relationship. But in a recent episode of \"Sister Wives,\" he shared that he once considered leaving her amid struggles in their marriage.",
      "The father of 18 made the confession in the April 27 episode of \"Sister Wives\" while discussing the impact his breakups with his first three wives had on his marriage with Robyn Brown, his fourth wife.",
      "\u201cBecause I\u2019d been in plural marriage for so long and it was a sole focus of marriage for me, when we failed at it, I was sabotaging myself,\u201d he said in a confessional interview.",
      "\u201cThere were days, unfair to\u00a0Robyn,\u00a0that I thought about just walking away from our relationship too. And that was just because I was so broken, I became self-destructive.\u201d",
      "Kody Brown was once married to Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn Brown and maintained a plural family with 18 children. His breakup with Christine Brown in 2021 ushered in a period of discord in his plural family. His marriages with Janelle and Meri Brown later ended.",
      "Throughout Season 19 of \"Sister Wives,\" Kody and Robyn Brown have spoken candidly about the new monogamous dynamic in their relationship. Kody Brown has also said he wouldn't consider polygamy again.",
      "During the latest episode of the TLC series, Robyn Brown asked her husband how he was feeling about monogamy. He replied, \"At peace.\"",
      "\"And I\u2019m sad because the difficulties of the past three years, I feel like have affected us. I want to apologize for the dark space I went through and how it harmed you because it wasn\u2019t fair to you,\" he said.",
      "Kody Brown continued, explaining why he misdirected his anger towards Robyn Brown.",
      "\"Because I was angry, you were withdrawing from me. And because you were withdrawing from me, I was experiencing not just the anger from the rejection and the anger from our failures in plural marriage and everything that I was experiencing there \u2014 it was causing me to literally have bad thoughts about us,\" he said.",
      "Robyn Brown said she understood why her husband had difficulty processing the end of his other three marriages, but observed he had been \"very, very angry.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m sorry to you. I\u2019m sorry to them,\" he replied.",
      "In a confessional interview, Kody Brown said he \"failed to recognize what a struggle (plural marriage) would be for my wives.\"",
      "He also acknowledged his feelings for Meri, Janelle and Christine, which he spent many episodes denying.",
      "\"I tried to convince myself that I did this on purpose because I didn\u2019t love them. As much as I said I hated them or that I didn\u2019t love them, I loved them. This situation, what we experienced, is over. If it could be friendly, I would be very happy,\" he said.",
      "Back in his conversation with Robyn Brown, Kody Brown told his wife he's happy that they're only married to each other now.",
      "\"I\u2019m very pleased and happy at this point from the experience that I\u2019ve had to be in a monogamous marriage with you,\" he said."

    "summary": "How accurate is the movie Conclave compared to the real election of the pope? Here's what to know",
    "story": [
      "Following Pope Francis' death on April 21, all eyes are on the College of Cardinals who are set to start a conclave soon to elect a new pope.",
      "The process has remained largely secretive over the eight centuries that conclaves have been used to elect new popes as cardinals sequester themselves during the voting process.",
      "The conclave following the death of Pope Francis will begin May 7, Vatican officials announced. In the meantime, people have turned to the 2024 Oscar-winning film \"Conclave\" to get an inside look at the process. In fact, \"Conclave\" viewing rose 283% in the week following Pope Francis' death, \"coming in at nearly 7 million minutes watched across streaming platforms,\" Carson Daly said on TODAY.",
      "But how accurate is \"Conclave\" to the actual papal conclave? Let's get into it.",
      "What parts of 'Conclave' were spot-on?",
      "While the process of selecting a new pope is extremely secretive, certain things are known, which the film shows.",
      "Much of the film unfolds in a re-creation of the Vatican's famous Sistine Chapel, where the conclave takes place in real life.",
      "The Sistine Chapel is sealed off until voting has closed \u201cso that total secrecy may be ensured with regard to everything said or done there in any way pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the election of the Supreme Pontiff,\u201d the\u00a0Apostolic Constitution states.",
      "The film accurately depicts the behind-the-scenes political conversations that occur between cardinals during a papal conclave, according to a Vatican expert.",
      "\u201cKeep in mind that cardinals are human beings. They\u2019re political animals as well. They will be meeting in various places,\u201d Philip Pullella, a Vatican expert and author, said in a segment that aired on TODAY April 21. \u201cYou know, Cardinal X will say to Cardinal Y, I\u2019ve been talking about this to Cardinal Z.\u201d",
      "Despite the drama and revelations, the voting in \"Conclave\" is fairly efficient. The cardinals take three days to elect a new pope in the film.",
      "Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI were both elected slightly faster \u2014 in two days. The longest conclave in the 20th century was in 1903, when the election of Pope Pius X took five days.",
      "The new pope accepts the position using Latin phrase laid out by the Apostolic Constitutions.",
      "Once a new pope has been selected, the dean of the College of Cardinals will ask the candidate-elect in Latin, \"Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?\"",
      "The candidate-elect needs to respond with \"Accepto,\" which is Latin for \"I accept.\"",
      "\"Conclave\" displays this exact conversation.",
      "What parts of 'Conclave' were semi-accurate?",
      "Other scenes in \"Conclave\" are partially correct.",
      "After the late pope dies, the cardinals gather around his body. Cardinal Tremblay (John Lithgow) removes his ring. Then Tremblay immediately breaks it, delivering the line, \u201cThe throne of the Holy See is vacant.\u201d",
      "As \"Conclave\" shows, the pope's signet ring, called Ring of the Fisherman, is destroyed after his death to signify the papal vacancy and to ensure that no forgeries can be made in the pope's name as the ring serves as a seal for letters, too.",
      "Traditionally the ring is removed from the pope's body, then it is held by the camerlengo (a Vatican official) until it is ceremoniously destroyed, according to the Vatican News.",
      "So, while the film got across the point that the ring needs to be removed and destroyed, it modified the process, depicting a private, quick ceremony.",
      "In the movie, cardinals burn their votes and send a signal to the outside world through the Sistine Chapel chimney. Black smoke signifies no choice has been made. White smoke signifies a new pope has been chosen.",
      "The colors are right but the number of burning sessions is not. In the film, the ballots are burned after each vote, whereas during a real conclave the ballots are burned after each voting session.",
      "According to the Vatican News, there are two voting sessions per day, and each session has two ballots.",
      "What parts of 'Conclave' were inaccurate?",
      "Here's what an expert said was the \"biggest mistake\" in the movie.",
      "Perhaps the biggest plot hole in the film was the movie's addition of Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz), the archbishop of Kabul.",
      "As the papal conclave is preparing to sequester themselves, Cardinal Benitez arrives with paperwork explaining that the previous pope had appointed him a cardinal \"in pectore,\" which means in secret.",
      "Cardinal Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) tells Cardinal Bellini (Stanley Tucci), \"I don't think we have any choice but to admit him,\" allowing him into the conclave.",
      "\"The biggest mistake in the movie was the admission of a cardinal in pectore into the conclave,\u201d Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior analyst with the Religion News Service and a Vatican expert told the AP. \u201cIf the name is not announced publicly by the pope in the presence of the College of Cardinals, he has no right to attend a conclave.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Benitez's age would probably prevent some from voting for him. While his age is not specified in the film, Diehz is 54 years old.",
      "\u201cThe Vatican is a very strange place because someone who is 65 or 70 is considered too young,\u201d Pullella said on TODAY. \u201cVery few cardinals want another papacy to last another 30 years.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Lawrence also breaks multiple rules himself, including busting into the sealed off quarters of the deceased pope to investigate other cardinals and telling another cardinal something that was told to him in confessional.",
      "According to the Code of Canon Law, the penalty for breaking the seal of confession is ex-communication.",
      "And while there's no specific punishment stated for breaking into the deceased pope's personal chambers, it is also unlikely that Cardinal Lawrence would be able to get away with that and even still be a favorable contender for the papacy himself."

      "On Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of hotel onto a crowd watching Jason Aldean perform at the\u00a0Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas. Police reported at least 58 people were killed in the shooting and more than 500 people were injured.",
      "Church, who performed at the venue just two days before the massacre, tells Sunday Sitdown host Willie Geist that he was never the same after he heard what had happened.",
      "\"I mean, we've all had bad years, but,\u00a02018 was a really bad year for me and it started with Vegas,\" he said. \u201cThere\u2019s certain indelible things that you just don\u2019t get over, and I think that was one for me.\u201d",
      "\"And after that, right after that, I had a health scare. I had a blood clot and thought I was going to die,\" Church continued. \"And then, my brother died, you know? So all this happened, within a matter of months.\"",
      "In 2018, Church revealed to Rolling Stone that he underwent an emergency surgery for a blood clot in his chest that was due to a birth defect. That was also the same year that his brother, Brandon, died.  The country star explained that those events humbled him in more ways than one.",
      "\"I think, up until that point, you can listen to the music, maybe, and you can see that I was brash, arrogant, in a lot of ways,\" he told Geist. \"But it changes, when you have those things happen to you. And I think it made the music more humble and, maybe, more observant.\"",
      "Church also opened up about how the Las Vegas shooting affected him, explaining that the bond between an artist and their fans is \"sacred,\" but that bond was \u201cshattered\u201d when gunman Stephen Paddock decided to cut some of those lives short.",
      "\"I had a lot of fans die,\" Church said. \"And I played the (Grand Ole) Opry right after that, and didn\u2019t want to be there. But I remember, there were a number of fans that had went to the Vegas show that were then going to fly across the country to come to the Opry show, to see me play the Opry.\"",
      "\"That was a part of their travel and some of \u2018em got shot,\" he said. \"They died. And I remember being at the Opry, that night and... it\u2019s still raw in a lot of ways, but just not something that affects you. And it broke me, in a way.\"",
      "Church performed at the Grand Ole Opry just days after his performance in Vegas. While onstage, he paid tribute to the victims with a new heartfelt song called \u201cWhy Not Me.\"",
      "In the song, he says, \"And when the morning sun hits the mountain / And a glorious still calms the breeze / I\u2019ll ask the God of infinite wisdom / Why you and why not me?\""

    "summary": "President Donald Trump injected himself into the race with his tariffs on Canadian imports and repeatedly saying Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
    "story": [
      "Canadian voters backed Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s Liberal Party on Monday, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. projects, in a national election strongly influenced by President Donald Trump.",
      "The CBC said it was too early to know whether the Liberals would win enough seats to form a majority government, but it projected another term for the party, which has governed Canada for almost a decade.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s ready to stand up for Canada with me?\u201d Carney told cheering supporters early Tuesday. He said that Trump\u2019s repeated comments about making Canada the 51st U.S. state were \u201cnot idle threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is trying to break us, so that America can own us. That will never, that will never, ever happen,\u201d he said.",
      "Carney said it was important to recognize that \u201cour world has fundamentally changed,\u201d and that Canada\u2019s old relationship with the United States, its longtime ally and trading partner, is \u201cover.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to look out for ourselves.\u201d",
      "Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, conceded defeat earlier Tuesday and congratulated Carney, describing the Liberals\u2019 projected victory as a \u201crazor-thin minority government\u201d and saying his party would hold them accountable.",
      "Only a few months ago, Poilievre \u2014 who is in danger of losing his seat in Parliament as votes continue to be counted \u2014 seemed poised to be the next leader of Canada amid public frustration with soaring inflation, rising immigration and what was criticized as then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s overly conciliatory approach to Trump, then the president-elect.",
      "Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, two weeks before Trump was inaugurated, after polls showed him struggling with voters.",
      "Since he returned to office, however, Trump has enraged Canadians with his behavior toward one of his country\u2019s closest allies. His policies and rhetoric \u2014 including imposing steep tariffs on Canadian imports and the \u201c51st state\u201d comments \u2014 became the central issue in the Canadian election and helped the Liberals make a remarkable turnaround, closing an almost 20-point gap with the Conservatives in a matter of weeks. The Liberals were also boosted by a candidate, Carney, who may be uniquely positioned to respond to Trump and the global economic uncertainty his tariffs have created.",
      "Like Trump, Carney had never held elected office before becoming his country\u2019s leader and spent much of his life in the private sector. He became prime minister last month after he was elected leader of the Liberal Party, then quickly called a snap election in the hope of securing a full term.",
      "Carney, 60, is also a former central banker used to dealing with economic crises, having run the Bank of Canada after the 2008 global financial crisis and the Bank of England during the Brexit process.",
      "He touted that experience during the campaign, which lasted 37 days.",
      "\u201cMark offers the proven leadership and real plan we need to deliver change for our party and our country, and to build the strongest economy in the G7,\u201d his campaign said, referring to the Group of Seven industrialized nations.",
      "Poilievre had been on a rising trajectory until earlier this year, with his \u201cTrump light\u201d style embraced by the populist wing of his party. As anger in Canada grew, however, his similarities with Trump began to work against him.",
      "Poilievre ran on job opportunities and on promises that Gen Z voters would be able to afford housing, leveraging public fatigue with the Liberal government. At a rally Sunday, the CBC quoted him as calling the Trudeau government \u201cthe lost Liberal decade of rising crime, chaos, drugs and disorder.\u201d",
      "Trump continued goading Canada on Monday as voters went to the polls, saying again that it should become the \u201ccherished\u201d 51st U.S. state.",
      "\u201cALL POSITIVES WITH NO NEGATIVES. IT WAS MEANT TO BE!\u201d he said on his Truth Social platform.\u00a0Both Carney and Poilievre rebuked Trump over such comments and others he has made about the Canadian election.",
      "\u201cThey can become divided and weak,\u201d Carney said in a video on social media Monday, speaking of the U.S. \u201cBut this is Canada. And we decide what happens here.\u201d",
      "Poilievre wrote Monday on X: \u201cPresident Trump, stay out of our election.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCanada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state.\u201d",
      "One voter said he voted Liberal because Poilievre \u201csounds like mini-Trump to me.\u201d Reid Warren, of Toronto, told The Associated Press that tariffs were also a concern.",
      "\u201cCanadians coming together from, you know, all the shade being thrown from the States is great, but it\u2019s definitely created some turmoil, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Warren said.",
      "Trump did not appear to have publicly commented on the election result as of late Monday, but his predecessor congratulated Carney and the Liberals.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m confident Mark will be a strong leader for the fundamental values and interests Canadians and Americans share,\u201d former President Joe Biden said in a post on X."

      "All 6.4 million electricity consumers in Portugal were once again receiving power, the country's government said Tuesday, adding that while trains and airports had resumed operations, there was still \u201csome recovery to be done\u201d at Lisbon\u2019s main airport.",
      "In Spain, the other country on the Iberian Peninsula, grid operator Red Electrica said in a post on X that more than 99% of the peninsula\u2019s demand was being served and that all of its substations were operational again.",
      "Power failures of this scale are rare in Europe, and when the outage hit around noon Monday (6 a.m. ET), airports were disabled and shops and offices were plunged into darkness.",
      "It took the better part of a day to restore full power to at least two major European economies \u2014 the tiny principality of Andorra in the Pyrenees Mountains was also hit.",

      "At the opening of the hearings at the U.N.\u2019s top court, the U.N.\u2019s legal counsel said Israel had a clear obligation as an occupying force to allow and facilitate humanitarian aid for the people in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIn the specific context of the current situation in the occupied Palestinian Territories, these obligations entail allowing all relevant U.N. entities to carry out activities for the benefit of the local population,\u201d Elinor Hammarskjold said.",
      "Palestinian representative Ammar Hijazi said Israel was using humanitarian aid as \u201ca weapon of war\u201d, while people in Gaza were facing starvation.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel had submitted its position in writing to the hearings, which he described as a \u201ccircus\u201d.",
      "Speaking in Jerusalem on Monday, Saar said the court was being politicized, while the U.N. was failing to root out employees of its Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA who are members of Gaza militant groups.",
      "\u201cThey are abusing the court once again to try and force Israel to cooperate with an organization that is infested with Hamas terrorists,\u201d Saar said. \u201cThe goal is to deprive Israel of its most basic right to defend itself.\u201d",
      "The U.N. said in August that nine UNRWA staff may have been involved in Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 assault and had been fired. Another Hamas commander, confirmed by UNRWA as one of its employees, was killed in Gaza in October, according to Israel.",

      "Israel has repeatedly said it would not allow the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza until Hamas releases all remaining hostages. It has accused Hamas of hijacking humanitarian aid, which the militant group denies.",
      "\u201cThis case is about Israel destroying the fundamentals of life in Palestine, while it blocks the U.N. and other providers of humanitarian aid from providing life-saving aid to the population,\u201d Hijazi, the head of the Palestinian mission to the Netherlands, told the hearing.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he had\u00a0pushed\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow food and medicine into Gaza. Germany, France and Britain last week\u00a0called\u00a0to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.",

      "While the U.S. military had no immediate comment, the strike in Yemen\u2019s Saada governorate, a stronghold for the Houthis, would  renew questions from activists about the American campaign, known as \u201cOperation Rough Rider,\u201d which has been targeting the rebels as the Trump administration negotiates with their main benefactor, Iran, over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "The U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, in a statement early Monday before news of the alleged strike broke, sought to defend its policy of offering no specific details of its extensive airstrike campaign. The strikes have drawn controversy in America over Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s use of the unclassified Signal messaging app to post sensitive details about the attacks.",
      "\u201cTo preserve operational security, we have intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations,\u201d Central Command said. \u201cWe are very deliberate in our operational approach, but will not reveal specifics about what we\u2019ve done or what we will do.\u201d",
      "It did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press about the alleged strike in Saada.",
      "Graphic footage aired by the Houthis\u2019 al-Masirah satellite news channel showed what appeared to be dead bodies and others wounded at the site. The Houthi-run Interior Ministry said some 115 migrants had been detained at the site.",
      "The rebels\u2019 Civil Defense organization said at least 68 people had been killed and 47 others wounded in the attack.",

      "It's morning in Khan Younis, and the Al-Zurai family wakes up in a tent pitched on the rubble of the cement house they once shared. The tiles that used to be the floor of their home are loosely laid across the sandy ground, marking the space of what is now a makeshift outdoor kitchen.",
      "\u201cToday, God sends us cans, so we\u2019re cooking them for the children,\u201d Suad Al-Zurai, 57, said of the canned beans that she stirs in a simmering pot. It's the 558th day of the war, and the children, along with the adults, are hungry, covered in dust, haunted by death and facing another day of scraping together a life from the ruins of the Gaza Strip.",
      "NBC News' crew on the ground spent a day with the Al-Zurai family, from early morning to sunset, to see how they, and thousands of families across the enclave, are living after the ceasefire broke, and Israel began a blockade in early March, barring the entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies into the enclave.",
      "There are 16 members of the Al-Zurai family to share the single pot of beans, eight of them children. At least five more should be there with them, Suad says. One of her sons was killed along with two of her grandchildren, while another, Khaled Al-Zurai,\u00a0has been missing for days after an explosion that killed one of his sons. Suad is now taking care of his wife, who has cancer, and their four surviving children. Her third son, Hamed Al-Zurai, and his four children also live with her. Other relatives are displaced to other parts of Gaza.",
      "Suad's exhaustion is palpable as she stirs the pot under a blazing sun.",
      "For her, enduring survival has begun to feel like death. \u201cWe all die 100 times, every day,\u201d she said, \u201cwe die 100 times daily from fear and horror.\u201d",
      "Her slain loved ones are among more than 51,000 people who have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local health ministry, since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks. Some 1,200 people were killed during the attacks in southern Israel and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Throughout the course of the day, worries over food, water and other necessities dominate the family's discussions, and finding those supplies takes up much of the rest of their time as humanitarian groups warn that aid is running out.",
      "At one point, Hamed Al-Zurai's 3-year-old daughter, Anwar, throws herself to the floor, crying out for rice, but there isn\u2019t any more to give her.",
      "\u201cMy children are constantly crying,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to eat. And I answer them, \u2018How? There are no open crossings, so how can I get you food, my love?\u2019\u201d",
      "Before the war, most of the children spent their mornings at school. Now, they dedicate hours each day to trying to find food and water.",
      "Pushing their fears for their missing father aside, Khaled Al-Zurai's children, Mohammed, 13, and Suad, 12, dutifully pick up their pots and pans and head to the soup kitchen with their cousin, Shadi, 7, taking NBC News' crew with them on the roughly 30-minute walk. At the soup kitchen, there's already a crowd of other children, along with some women and men, waiting for food under the hot sun. The younger Suad stands with her empty pot in her hands, gazing into the distance, bored and exhausted, as she waits, later joining her brother and sister and sitting in a ditch in the shade before they try again.",
      "On offer is rice \u2014 and after waiting for an hour, they fill their pots, carrying it back to their tent.",
      "While they're getting food, Hamed and young Anwar are out to get water for the family. Anwar walks swiftly as she carries two water jugs, each nearly half the size of her small body.",
      "Before the war, Hamed Al-Zurai had a cart and a donkey that he would use to rent out transportation services, but after the donkey died in the war and he lost his cart, he no longer has a way to make money. Unable to buy food or water, the family is left dependent on swiftly dwindling aid.\u201cThe situation is dire,\u201d he said.",
      "But even at a time of incredible darkness, there are moments of light for the Al-Zurais: smiles as they gather together in their tent, finally sharing their hard-won lunch.",
      "After eating, Mohammed gives his younger siblings and cousins old rubber tires to play with. Anwar grins as she wheels one across the sandy ground.",
      "As the sun goes down, the children huddle in a circle outside, laughing as they play hand-clapping games. And for a moment, they look just like any other children anywhere else in the world.Then, they return to their makeshift tent to eat a meager dinner of more rice and beans, before eventually settling down for bed, huddling together on the ground, wrapped in blankets.",
      "\u201cWe hate the nighttime,\u201d Suad Al-Zurai said. And, she added, \u201cthe daytime.\u201d"

      "Militants armed with rifles had descended on tourists in the meadow from the surrounding woods, identifying non-Muslims and then separating the men from the women and children.",
      "One of the militants \u201cshot six to seven men in front of me,\u201d Kalthia said, before shooting her husband, Shailesh.",
      "\u201cMy husband died in my lap, and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she told reporters Thursday at his funeral in their hometown of Surat in the Indian state of Gujarat.",
      "Twenty-six people were killed in the Tuesday attack, which took place in one of Kashmir\u2019s top tourist destinations, the Baisaran Valley, whose lush green meadows, dense pine forests and snowcapped mountains have led it to be called India\u2019s \u201cmini Switzerland.\u201d",
      "It was the deadliest attack on Indian civilians in almost two decades, and took place while Vice President JD Vance and his family were visiting another part of India. All but one of those killed were Indian nationals; the other was from Nepal.",
      "The attack near the town of Pahalgam in Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region that is the only Muslim-majority part of India, has devastated the local tourism industry on which many rely for their livelihood. It also undermined Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s insistence that the security situation had stabilized after a decadeslong separatist insurgency.",
      "New Delhi has responded with fury, immediately downgrading ties with neighboring Pakistan, which it has long accused of supporting cross-border terrorism. Indian officials say the gunmen had ties to militant groups based in Pakistan, which denies any involvement.",
      "Relations between the two nuclear powers, which both rule parts of Kashmir and have fought two wars over the region, are now at their lowest point in years after tit-for-tat treaty suspensions and the expulsion of diplomats and civilians. On Saturday, Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged gunfire for the second day in a row along the Line of Control that divides the two parts of Kashmir.",
      "Modi, a Hindu nationalist who has overseen a crackdown on dissent in Kashmir, vowed retribution for the attack. The family homes of several suspects have been demolished.",
      "\u201cI say to the whole world, India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers,\u201d he said Thursday.",
      "President Donald Trump, who is close with Modi, said the Indian leader has his \u201cfull support.\u201d",
      "For Indians watching Modi\u2019s speech, it was an echo of 2019 when a convoy of Indian security forces was blown up in Kashmir and he responded by launching aerial strikes on Pakistan.",
      "Six years later, Indian nationalism is higher than ever, the Pakistan military\u2019s grip on power has weakened, and the U.S. is no longer in Afghanistan, which analysts say historically deterred violence between India and Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThat perhaps gives India a bit of a blank check to do whatever it pleases,\u201d said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "A region simmering with rage",
      "Resentment between India and Pakistan dates to 1947, when Hindu-majority India gained independence from British colonial rule and Muslim-majority Pakistan was established as a separate state in a deadly partition in which at least an estimated million people were killed while migrating across the newly formed border.",
      "The border lines were clearly defined and accepted except for the mountainous state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is among the most militarized places in the world. Both Pakistan and India lay full claim to it, but most of it is Indian-administered, while Pakistan controls a small chunk to the west.",
      "Tensions have escalated since Modi revoked Kashmir\u2019s semiautonomous status in 2019, effectively putting the region under direct control of the federal government in a move that was criticized by rights groups and raised fears that Kashmir\u2019s ethnic and religious identity would be diluted by Hindu settlers.",
      "Modi\u2019s government said the move ended decades of armed rebellion in the region. Elections were held last year and hailed as a sign of normalcy.",
      "\u201cOne indicator of normalcy that the government was always giving out was, look, there are so many tourists visiting,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Deependra Singh Hooda, former head of the Indian Army\u2019s Northern Command, who was stationed in Jammu and Kashmir from 2012 to 2016.",
      "Praveen Donthi, a New Delhi-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the attack was a \u201ccolossal intelligence failure.\u201d",
      "Modi\u2019s narrative of peace and stability \u201cled to complacency, which is why they did not see this coming,\u201d he said.",
      "'Bodies lying on the ground'",
      "Pallavi Rao and her husband, Manjunath, had taken their son to Kashmir to celebrate his near-perfect score on his high school diploma exams. They had enjoyed a boat ride on the popular Dal lake in Kashmir\u2019s main city of Srinagar before heading to Pahalgam about 30 miles away.",
      "The militants found them in the meadow.",
      "After her husband was shot in the head, Rao told reporters, she and her son asked the militants to kill them too. They refused, saying, \u201cWe won\u2019t kill you. Go tell Prime Minister Modi.\u201d",
      "A local pony handler, Syed Adil Hussain Shah, was also killed while trying to save the tourists.",
      "\u201cHe used to earn 300 rupees [$3.50] in a day, our only source of income in the family,\u201d Ravisa Hussain Shah, his younger sister, told NBC News in an interview at their home in the village of Hapatnur.",
      "Among the first to reach the scene was Sajad Ahmad Bhat, 31, a shawl seller and tour guide.",

      "Bhat carried one of the victims almost 2.5 miles to safety, video of which went viral online.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who the boy was. But he was crying and seeking help. His hands and sweater were soaked in blood,\u201d he said.",
      "Since the attack, India has suspended a 1960 water treaty with Pakistan and closed the only functional land border crossing. Pakistan, which said any disruption to its water supply would be considered an \u201cact of war,\u201d has closed its airspace to Indian airlines and halted all trade with its neighbor.",
      "Analysts inside Pakistan say the government may use the situation to bring the Kashmir issue back into global discussions.",

      "Even in death, Pope Francis\u2019 moral voice rang out across the world.",
      "With 40,000 packed into Vatican City\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square, another 250,000 in the surrounding streets and millions more watching on TV and online, world leaders, including President Donald Trump, were reminded of Francis\u2019 central messages during his funeral Saturday.",
      "\u201c\u2018Build bridges, not walls\u2019 was an exhortation he repeated many times,\u201d Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re said during the homily for the late pope. \u201cHis gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.\u201d",
      "And war \u201calways leaves the world worse than it was before: It is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone,\u201d Re said.",
      "Francis often railed against the geopolitical tides. He urged more compassion for immigrants and refugees at a time when the White House and other governments are cracking down. He called for an end to the war in Gaza and denounced climate change and exploitative capitalism \u2014 when those crises have only intensified.",
      "Under warm, blue skies with the world watching, the homily was a reminder of Francis\u2019 often lonely voice in a world characterized by economic and military hard power. It also brought to mind the unspoken questions, on this day at least, about whether the late pontiff\u2019s replacement will continue these progressive notes or revert to a more conservative bent.",
      "The relatively simple funeral for Francis, who died at age 88 on Monday, was attended by some 170 heads of state and other dignitaries. Trump sat among Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Britain\u2019s Prince William.",
      "Francis\u2019 casket was taken on a final journey in the so-called popemobile through the streets of Rome, past landmarks such as the Colosseum, to St. Mary Major Basilica, where he had chosen to be buried.",
      "The people lining the streets had come from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI could not have been anywhere else today. For me, Pope Francis was a wonderful pope, a gift that the lord gave us,\u201d said Katherine Gilligan, 59, who was visiting Rome last week from Jacksonville, Florida, and decided to postpone her return journey when Francis died. \u201cHe has loved us and taught us piety. It will be difficult for there to be another pope like him.\u201d",
      "At St. Mary Major Basilica, his casket was met, according to his wishes, by dozens of Rome\u2019s impoverished and needy, including prisoners, migrants, homeless and transgender people.",
      "It was just one reflection of a pope who did things a bit differently. He had even adjusted his own funeral plans: Whereas previous popes have been entombed in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead and oak, Francis requested he be buried in a single, simple wooden casket lined with zinc.",
      "Even so, this was an event of epic majesty. From the arcing dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, one of the largest churches in the world, to the striking image of a square divided between a mass of red on one side \u2014 the cardinals and bishops \u2014 and black on the other \u2014 attending dignitaries.",
      "In life, Francis had declined to live in the Vatican\u2019s gilded Apostolic Palace, choosing instead its far more plebeian guesthouse, Casa Santa Marta, where he died after a period of well-publicized illness.",
      "Francis had plenty of critics, both conservatives who believed he focused too much on progressive causes, and more liberal audiences who felt he did not go far enough with his reforms.",
      "Either way, the absence of his frequent and outspoken interjections on world affairs will leave a void to be filled. And though he spoke with a freedom unafforded to more prominent global figures, his funeral was still a deeply political event.",
      "Re\u2019s reminder that Francis preferred bridges over walls conjured the late pope\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s first-term promise to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "One day before his death, Francis met with Vice President JD Vance after sharply rebuking the Trump administration for cracking down on immigration and slashing international aid. In February, he said a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d was taking place in the United States, referring to \u201ca program of mass deportations.\u201d",
      "Perhaps inevitably with so many powerful figures in attendance, the funeral served as a forum for real-world geopolitics. Trump was seen locked in a sit-down discussion with Zelenskyy, two of the parties who say they are trying to negotiate a peace deal alongside Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said on X afterward that it was a \u201cgood meeting.\u201d But there was little immediate sign that Francis\u2019 death would solve a crisis he was unable to affect in life.",
      "Nevertheless, despite scandal within the church and uncertainty without, there was plenty of Francis\u2019 platform that few would disagree with.",
      "Re reflected this while closing the homily: \u201cEmbrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.\u201d"

      "Yunice Abbas, perhaps the best-known defendant in the trial, said that despite a yearslong criminal history, this was the first time he had truly come to recognize the \u201ctrauma\u201d he had caused his victim.",
      "\u201cI regret it, not because I got caught, but because ... there was a trauma,\u201d Abbas, 72, said before a jury Tuesday as proceedings against the 10 people charged in connection with the 2016 robbery resumed after launching Monday afternoon.",
      "The first of several defendants set to testify in the trial, Abbas had previously confessed to his role in the heist, detailing the robbery in his 2021 book, \u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian.\u201dThe matter of the book came up during the testimony, with Abbas saying that he was not responsible for the title and that he disputes his alleged role in the heist. He added that he was not involved in tying up Kardashian, who was staying in Paris for the city's Fashion Week, instead staying downstairs to keep watch.",
      "Abbas and nine others, dubbed the \u201cgrandpa robbers\u201d in local media due to their ages \u2014 some of the accused are in their 70s and 80s \u2014 are alleged to have played a range of roles in the heist including holding Kardashian, 44, at gunpoint and being complicit in that crime.",
      "During questioning, Abbas described his criminal past \u2014 he has spent a total of almost 20 years in jail for various crimes \u2014 including the armed robbery of a bank in Belgium. He said that as a young man, he was fiercely opposed to theft, but had turned to a life of crime due to the bad influence of friends and money difficulties, in the hope it would prove an easier path.",
      "Abbas said his family had suffered because of his crimes, adding that he had \u201cnever had a role model\u201d himself and he had done what he thought was needed to try to provide for his children.",
      "The accused spoke rapidly during his testimony, his arm shaking throughout, possibly due to the fact he is now suffering from Parkinson's disease. At one point, the shaking was violent enough for him to hold one hand in the other.",
      "In the years since the 2016 robbery targeting Kardashian, Abbas said he now felt \u201cvery uneasy\u201d with what happened that day. But, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything besides apologize.\u201dKardashian had been staying at a private apartment complex in the French capital when five of the accused are alleged to have gained entry into the building and robbed her at gunpoint, taking items including her engagement ring from her then-husband Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. The five other defendants are accused of related offenses, including planning and giving tipoffs on Kardashian's whereabouts.",
      "In the years since, one defendant has died, while the case of another, age 80, has been separated from that of the other defendants due to medical issues.",
      "In addition to Abbas, those standing trial will include Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as \u201cOld Omar,\u201d who is alleged to have masterminded the robbery; his son, Harminy, 37, accused of being the getaway driver; Didier \u201cBlue Eyes\u201d Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian\u2019s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35,\u00a0who is accused of tipping the others off on Kardashian's whereabouts. Christiane Glotin, 78, is also among the accused, with authorities alleging she was an accomplice in the heist.",
      "At least four defendants were expected to be questioned in court Tuesday.",
      "Kardashian herself is expected to appear in court May 13. The reality star and businesswoman has previously detailed her experience during the robbery, at one point tearing up in an interview with David Letterman as she described how she feared she would be sexually assaulted and\u00a0possibly killed during the attack.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, this is the time I\u2019m going to get raped ... just prepare yourself,\u201d she said in the interview, wiping away tears, later describing how she feared her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, would find her dead.",

      "SANTA ANA, El Salvador \u2014 The sprawling penitentiary where Kilmar Abrego Garcia was last known to be held offers a sharp contrast to the supermax mega-prison to which he was first deported.",
      "As opposed to tattooed gang members in brightly lit, crowded cells, the inmates at the Centro Industrial prison in Santa Ana wear yellow T-shirts and move more or less freely. Some spend much of their time outdoors raising dairy cows and growing vegetables. Others work in factories making uniforms for the armed forces or desks for public schools.",
      "The government calls them \u201ctrusted inmates\u201d: They have exhibited good behavior and are in the final years of their sentences. And the prison categorically excludes anyone accused of belonging to a gang.",
      "\u201cWe only house the common population,\u201d said Samuel Diaz, the prison\u2019s director and warden. \u201cNo gang members work here.\u201d",
      "NBC News obtained access Monday to the Centro Industrial in Santa Ana in a carefully choreographed tour. Officials did not provide access to Abrego Garcia, and they would not answer questions about his location, the conditions of his detention or any other aspects of his case. But they facilitated interviews with other inmates, who described the conditions in the prison as \u201cexcellent.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the Justice Department has acknowledged should not have been sent to a prison in his native El Salvador because of an immigration judge\u2019s 2019 order barring such action.",
      "For human rights advocates in El Salvador and the United States, the details of Abrego Garcia\u2019s transfer \u2014 from the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a supermax prison specifically designed for gang members, to a low-security prison from which gang members are excluded \u2014 contradicts a central claim made by both governments: that Abrego Garcia is a dangerous member of MS-13 and a terrorist. (His wife and his attorney deny those allegations.)",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s precise whereabouts and condition remain unknown. Since he was deported, Abrego Garcia has been allowed no contact with his family or his lawyers. In a meeting with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., on April 17 (the only time he has been seen since he was deported), Abrego Garcia said he had been transferred out of CECOT to a different facility. Documents the Justice Department filed in federal court on April 20 subsequently confirmed that facility to be the Centro Industrial in Santa Ana. There have been no updates since then.",
      "From that perspective, Abrego Garcia\u2019s transfer out of CECOT is worrisome, said Gabriela Santos, director of the Human Rights Institute at the Central American University in San Salvador.",
      "\u201cWhy was he moved?\u201d Santos said. \u201cAnd where are all the other migrants that were brought here \u2014 are they in CECOT, or are they being put in different prisons in El Salvador?\u201d",
      "Santos said there is no evident legal basis for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele\u2019s agreement with Trump to receive and imprison deportees from the United States.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal point of view, there is no reason for [Abrego Garcia] to be here,\u201d Santos said. And because Bukele has consolidated power over all branches of government, she said, there is no viable avenue to challenge the policy.",
      "\u201cThere is no rule of law here in El Salvador. There is no respect for the principle of legality,\u201d she said.",
      "Like Abrego Garcia and others the Trump administration deported directly to CECOT, all inmates in the Salvadoran prison system are cut off from contact with lawyers, loved ones and\u00a0others on the outside. The policy is the result of a \u201cstate of exception\u201d that Bukele declared in 2022 after a particularly brutal wave of gang violence, in which he suspended many constitutional protections to quickly imprison tens of thousands without due process.",
      "About 85,000 people were imprisoned under the state of exception, according to Salvadoran human rights groups. Many were subjected to mass trials of a hundred or more defendants with no access to counsel. Advocates have documented numerous stories of people with no proven affiliation with gangs who were incarcerated indefinitely with virtually no recourse to appeal.",
      "Moreover, rights groups in El Salvador and abroad have harshly criticized prison conditions in the country, alleging systematic torture, malnutrition and other abuses. The nongovernmental legal organization Socorro Jur\u00eddico Humanitario has documented 370 deaths in Salvadoran prisons since the state of exception was declared, a number the group says is most a likely undercount.",
      "\u201cFor three years, we have lost all human rights and constitutional guarantees in El Salvador,\u201d said Ingrid Escobar, a lawyer for the organization.",
      "Bukele has acknowledged that some innocent people have been arrested under the state of exception.",
      "\u201cObviously, our operations are not perfect, and without the intention of hurting anyone innocent, some innocents have been arrested, in the same way they have been in France, Germany, Japan and every country in the world,\u201d Bukele said in November. \u201cAnd we are freeing them \u2014 we have freed 8,000 people, and we will free 100% of innocents.\u201d",
      "The Bukele administration says holding prisoners incommunicado was a necessary measure to break the control that gangs had over El Salvador\u2019s prisons, which involved regularly organizing murders, extortion and other criminal activity from inside penitentiaries.",
      "Since the state of exception was declared, public safety has improved dramatically in El Salvador. Numerous people interviewed on the streets of San Salvador said they feel free to move around the city and go about their business without fear of harassment, extortion or violence from gangs. Those improvements have made Bukele one of the most popular heads of state in the world.",
      "But human rights advocates say that the improvements have come at a heavy cost to Salvadoran democracy \u2014 and that Bukele\u2019s popularity is no justification for authoritarianism.",
      "\u201cPopularity cannot be a blank check for him to do anything he wants,\u201d Santos said. \u201cHistory has taught us that just because someone is popular, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d"

      "\"The Yemeni Armed Forces will persist to target and pursue the aircraft carrier and all enemy warships in the Red and Arabian Seas until the aggression against Yemen is halted,\" the Houthi statement said.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Four former Hong Kong lawmakers were freed from prison Tuesday after serving more than four years for their convictions under a Beijing-imposed security law that crushed a once-thriving pro-democracy movement.",
      "Claudia Mo, Jeremy Tam, Kwok Ka-ki and Gary Fan were among 47 activists arrested in 2021 for their roles in an unofficial primary election. They were the first of the convicted activists to reunite with their families and friends following years of separation.",
      "Only vehicles involved in the release were seen leaving the three prisons in remote areas of Hong Kong. Security was tight and curtains on the vehicles were closed.",
      "Mo\u2019s husband, Philip Bowring, told reporters he was pleased Mo had returned home, saying she was \u201cwell and in good spirits.\u201d But he said she would not give interviews for the time being. \u201cShe has to get used to life again in the outside world,\u201d he said at their door, adding that they probably would go to England to see their grandchildren later.",
      "In a video posted by local online media HK01, Fan thanked Hong Kongers and the media for their concern. He added he was going to reunite with his family.",
      "The 2020 unofficial primary drew 610,000 voters, and its winners had been expected to advance to the official legislative election. Authorities postponed that, however, citing public health risks during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "During the trial, prosecutors said the activists aimed to paralyze Hong Kong\u2019s government and force the city\u2019s leader to resign by aiming to win a legislative majority and using it to block government budgets indiscriminately. The judges said in their verdict last year that the activists\u2019 plans to effect change through the unofficial primary would have undermined the government\u2019s authority and created a constitutional crisis.",
      "Only two of the 47 original defendants were acquitted. The remaining activists received prison terms ranging from four years and two months to 10 years on a charge of conspiracy to commit subversion. Mo, Tam, Kwok and Fan pleaded guilty and received reduced sentences.",
      "Their years of separation have pained the activists and their families. The case involved democracy advocates across the spectrum. They include legal scholar Benny Tai, who got a 10-year prison term, and former student leader Joshua Wong, who has to serve four years and eight months.",
      "Fourteen of the convicted activists have appealed, and prosecutors appealed the acquittal of one activist. All of the appeals are pending.",
      "Critics of the court actions brought against the activists said their convictions illustrated how authorities crushed dissent following the massive anti-government protests in 2019, while also cracking down on media freedoms and reducing public choice in elections. They said the drastic political changes reflect the shrinking of the Western-style civil liberties in Hong Kong that Beijing promised to retain in the former British colony for 50 years after the 1997 handover to China.",
      "The Beijing and Hong Kong governments insisted the national security law was necessary for the city\u2019s stability. China defended the judicial decisions, despite criticism from foreign governments."
