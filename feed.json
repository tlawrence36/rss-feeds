      "\u201cOn some days, I\u2019m like that was just a blink away. But for the most part, yeah, it feels like a long time because I\u2019ve been waiting. I felt stagnant, I felt stuck for a while, and conflicted,\u201d said the two-time Grammy-nominated artist. \u201cI\u2019m very much approaching this like I\u2019m starting over because that\u2019s how it feels to me. I\u2019ve lived nine lives since I last released \u2026 I\u2019m a whole different person.\u201d",
      "Hilson, the 42-year-old R&B star known for late 2000s hits like \u201cKnock You Down,\u201d featuring Kanye West and Ne-Yo. and \u201cPretty Girl Rock,\u201d released \u201cWE NEED TO TALK: LOVE\u201d on Friday. It's her third album, following 2010\u2019s \u201cNo Boys Allowed,\u201d and is the first of a trilogy set for release this year. Led by the sultry single \u201cBae,\u201d the nine-track album delves into romance and introspection.",
      "\u201cI feel resolved, both with the art and within about stepping back into the light. So, I think that resolve kind of had to be found before I felt confident enough to release the body of work and also unleash myself to the world again,\u201d explained Hilson, who said she\u2019s never stopped recording. \u201cThere were songs in my past that I felt were political moves, songs I didn\u2019t really love that I had to sing \u2026 I didn\u2019t want to feel like that this time around.\u201d",
      "One of those songs was a leaked remix to her popular 2009 single \u201cTurnin Me On\u201d featuring Lil Wayne, which peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard Hot 100. Lyrics included a diss fans perceived to be aimed at Beyonc\u00e9.",
      "Hilson, who had yet to drop her introductory album, \u201cIn A Perfect World,\u201d which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard Top 200 and No. 1 on Top R&B albums, claimed that she was forced to sing the lines, \u201cShe can sing / But she need to move it to the left, left,\u201d assumed to reference Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cIrreplaceable.\u201d She says she was threatened her album might not be released if she refused.",
      "Last week, Hilson trended on social media following an interview with iHeartMedia\u2019s \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d after recalling the incident. While she has talked about it several times in the past, during that interview, the singer publicly named those involved, including producer Polow Da Don who she was signed to. She did not name singer-songwriter Ester Dean. However, after social media users tagged Dean in posts, she later identified herself.",
      "The ending of a decadelong relationship, a lack of control over her career and the intense, never-ending backlash from the BeyHive triggered depression and led to her retreat from music.",
      "During her time away, the Georgia native embarked on a journey of healing that included therapy, journaling and spiritual retreats.",
      "\u201cThere were some perspectives that I needed to uncover ... untruths, beliefs that I kind of picked up or inherited about myself,\u201d said Hilson, who shifted to acting.",
      "Her comeback has included very selective press, avoiding what she describes as \u201cnew media\u201d outlets such as social media-driven platforms, saying monetization can reward the promotion of gossip or incentivize the creation of lies. The salacious blog culture of the 2010s was a driving force in fanning the flames of her perceived beef with Beyonc\u00e9, who has never publicly commented on the situation.",
      "Hilson \u201ccan definitely operate and navigate within the realm of R&B. She has a fan base,\u201d said Keithan Samuels, founder of the popular website RatedRnB.com. \u201cHer core fan base has matured \u2026 she can navigate within this new era of R&B where there\u2019s a lot of diversity and sound.\u201d",
      "Crafted with unofficial writing camps and records created throughout the years, \u201cWE NEED TO TALK: LOVE\u201d finds Hilson delivering vulnerable and flirty lyrics over a wide range of R&B sounds. Writing on all but one song, she avoided current R&B trends that developed during her absence, citing individuality as a key to her early success. She also believes algorithms have created a culture of musical homogeny, rather than creativity.",
      "There are quintessential \u201cMs. Keri Baby\u201d songs like the fun, Pop&B styled \u201cSomethin (Bout U),\u201d but there\u2019s also the introspective \u201cNaked (Love),\u201d and \u201cSay It,\u201d in which she expresses, \u201cI won\u2019t say I love you / \u2018til you say you love me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very \u2018girl boss\u2019 in my life, right? When it comes to relationships, I prefer to be a lady. I prefer to be approached. \u2026 I prefer for the man to say \u2018I love you\u2019 first. I just prefer for a man to lead,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI\u2019m really a damsel \u2013 without the distress.\u201d",
      "The bedroom mood is set on the sexy slow jam \u201cScream,\u201d while the bright \u201cWhatever\u201d floats with beautiful stacked harmonies.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s something I would have written for Whitney. And I actually wrote a song for Whitney that she never was able to record,\u201d said Hilson, who began her career as an in-demand writer whose credits include songs for Chris Brown, Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Lopez and Britney Spears. \u201cThis reminds me of a Whitney Houston record, where I think she would be now.\u201d",
      "Samuels of RatedRnB.com says this project is evident of the newfound control Hilson has over her career.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not, to me, an attempt to have this commercial comeback \u2026 it feels more personal,\u201d said Samuels. \u201cThe other two albums, I feel like were more catered to what was current then.\u201d",
      "Hilson says she\u2019s still open to writing for other artists and giving away songs that may not fit her current musical era. She also has a new Lifetime movie, \u201cFame: A Temptations Story,\u201d co-starring Keshia Chant\u00e9, premiering April 26 at 8 p.m. EDT. Hilson says acting is now an equal part of her career.",
      "Though Hilson may be cautiously re-emerging musically, fans are welcoming her return. After The Breakfast Club interview, fans flooded her with sympathy and positivity, possibly due to a combination of her finally telling her side of the story in detail, as well as the passing of time. Some fans said they forgot about the incident or were too young to know about it.",
      "\u201cI just control what I can control \u2026 I control what I allow to bring me up or down. These are realizations that I\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been away,\u201d said Hilson. \u201cI feel unburdened \u2026 I\u2019m not projecting too much of the past onto now, and all of that is freeing.\u201d",

      "Judge Paul Goetz late Thursday ordered that Weinstein be immediately relocated from the city\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail complex to the prison ward at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan so he can receive necessary medical treatment.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers lobbied for the move as jury selection got underway this week.",
      "They argued in court papers that being locked up in a sometimes freezing jail cell was exacerbating the Oscar-winning producer's health issues, which include chronic myeloid leukemia, diabetes and walking difficulties that require a wheelchair to get in and out of court.",
      "Goetz\u2019s order will remain in effect at least until next Thursday, when he is set to hold a hearing to discuss the matter further.",
      "A different judge, Curtis Farber, is presiding over Weinstein's retrial. The case will resume Monday with more jury selection after nine jurors were picked this week. In all, 12 jurors and six alternates need to be seated.",
      "Weinstein is being tried again on rape and sexual assault charges after New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, last year overturned his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial, finding that improper rulings and prejudicial testimony tainted the original one.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Weinstein has been back and forth numerous times to Bellevue in recent months for treatment of various maladies. At a pretrial hearing in January, he railed against his treatment at Rikers, telling Farber he wanted to \u201cget out of this hellhole as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Weinstein's lawyers filed a legal claim against New York City last November, alleging he was receiving substandard medical treatment in unhygienic conditions at Rikers. The claim, which seeks $5 million in damages, argues that Weinstein has been returned to Rikers each time before fully recovering at the hospital.",
      "The troubled jail complex has faced growing scrutiny for its mistreatment of detainees and dangerous conditions. Last year, a federal judge cleared the way for a possible federal takeover, finding the city had placed inmates in \u201cunconstitutional danger.\u201d",

      "Hip hop superstar Drake is now complaining about rival rapper Kendrick Lamar's performance of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d at this year's Super Bowl, adding it to his defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over the diss track and its allegations of pedophilia against Drake.",
      "\u201cThe Recording was performed during the 2025 Super Bowl and broadcast to the largest audience for a Super Bowl halftime show ever, over 133 million people, including millions of children, and millions more who had never before heard the song or any of the songs that preceded it,\" says the amended lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "It adds, \"It was the first, and will hopefully be the last, Super Bowl halftime show orchestrated to assassinate the character of another artist.\u201d",
      "Although Lamar removed the word \u201cpedophile\u201d that's in the track during the halftime show, the fact that it was omitted showed that \u201cnearly everyone understands that it is defamatory,\u201d the suit says. It also alleges Universal Music used financial benefits and leveraged business relationships to secure the headliner spot for Lamar at the Super Bowl, and promoted the performance.",
      "\u201cDrake\u2019s amended complaint makes an already strong case stronger,\u201d his lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, said in a statement. \"Drake will expose the evidence of UMG\u2019s misconduct, and UMG will be held accountable for the consequences of its ill-conceived decisions.\u201d",
      "This year's Super Bowl and its halftime show were the most-watched ever, according to Nielsen.",
      "In a statement responding to the court filing, Universal Music, the parent record label of both artists, continued to deny Drake's allegations.",
      "\u201cDrake, unquestionably one of the world\u2019s most accomplished artists and with whom we\u2019ve enjoyed a 16-year successful relationship, is being misled by his legal representatives into taking one absurd legal step after another,\" the company said. \u201cIt is shameful that these foolish and frivolous legal theatrics continue.\u201d",
      "The amended lawsuit also adds that defamatory portions of \u201cNot Like Us\" were played at the Grammy Awards in February, when the single won five awards, including song and record of the year. The suit claims that Universal Music also helped secure the Grammy nominations and allowed the song to be played at the ceremony.",
      "Drake sued Universal Music, but not Lamar, for undisclosed damages in January, saying the company published and promoted \u201cNot Like Us\u201d despite its false pedophilia allegations and suggestions that listeners should resort to vigilante justice.",
      "The result, the suit says, was intruders shooting a security guard at Drake\u2019s Toronto home and two attempted break-ins there, online hate and harassment, a hit to his reputation and a decrease in his brand\u2019s value before his contract renegotiation with UMG this year. The amended lawsuit also adds more online comments indicating people believe the pedophilia allegations.",
      "Drake, a 38-year-old Canadian rapper and singer and five-time Grammy winner, and Lamar, a 37-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner with 22 Grammy wins, have been beefing for years. The feud is among the biggest in hip hop in recent years.",
      "The two were occasional collaborators more than a decade ago, but Lamar began taking public jabs at Drake starting in 2013. The fight escalated steeply last year, as both launched diss tracks at each other, including Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cSay, Drake, I hear you like \u2019em young / You better not ever go to cell block one,\u201d Lamar raps.",
      "In its motion to dismiss the lawsuit, Universal Music says Drake helped fuel the beef with his own inflammatory diss tracks aimed at Lamar.",
      "\u201cPlaintiff, one of the most successful recording artists of all time, lost a rap battle that he provoked and in which he willingly participated,\" the motion says. \"Instead of accepting the loss like the unbothered rap artist he often claims to be, he has sued his own record label in a misguided attempt to salve his wounds.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Attorneys for hip-hop producer Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs asked a federal judge in New York on Wednesday to delay his May 5 sex-trafficking trial by two months so they can better prepare a defense.",
      "The lawyers said in a letter to Judge Arun Subramanian that prosecutors have been slow to turn over some potential evidence for review, making it difficult to be ready in three weeks.",

      "Pending the conference, the judge wrote, both sides should proceed as if the early May trial remains in place.",
      "Combs, 55, has been held without bail since his September arrest. He has pleaded not guilty to multiple crimes that prosecutors say occurred over a two-decade period.",
      "In their letter, defense lawyers cited a failure by prosecutors to turn over potential trial evidence in a timely matter, including materials relating to a superseding indictment returned by a grand jury earlier this month.",
      "For instance, the lawyers wrote, prosecutors have said they will not meet a Wednesday deadline to turn over exhibits and a witness list.",
      "Some evidence yet to be turned over includes materials related to a count in the indictment that carries a 15-year mandatory minimum prison sentence if a conviction is secured, the lawyers said.",
      "As a result, they wrote: \u201cWe cannot, in good conscience, go to trial on the scheduled date.\u201d",
      "They added: \u201cThis is a problem that the government has created, yet it opposes our reasonable request.\u201d",

      "Before Swedish slow TV hit \u201cThe Great Moose Migration\u201d began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals. She doesn't want to miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.",
      "\u201cSleep? Forget it. I don\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said.",
      "Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called \u201c Den stora \u00e4lgvandringen \u201d in Swedish and sometimes translated as \u201cThe Great Elk Trek\u201d in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play, the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.",
      "The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.",
      "From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the \u00c5ngerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.",
      "Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.",
      "\u201cI feel relaxed, but at the same time I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a moose, oh! What if there\u2019s a moose? I can\u2019t go to the toilet!\u2019\u201d said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.",
      "\u201cThe Great Moose Migration\" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.",
      "The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a \u201c fish doorbell \u201d on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.",
      "Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.",
      "\u201cIt became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,\" she said. \"But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.\u201d",
      "As an expert and a fan of \u201cThe Great Moose Migration,\u201d Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,\u201d she said.",
      "The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for \u201cThe Great Moose Migration.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,\u201d he said.",
      "The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.",
      "The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT\u2019s control room in Ume\u00e5, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.",
      "SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's cheap when accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.",
      "Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as \u201cKing of the Forest.\u201d A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).",
      "Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.",
      "\u201cWe actually don\u2019t see it very often. You often see it when you\u2019re out driving maybe once or twice in your life,\u201d Erhag said. \u201cI think that\u2019s one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone\u2019s living room.\"",
      "Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.",
      "\u201cYou can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,\u201d she said.",
      "After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.",
      "The push alert hits SVT's app \u2014 \u201cF\u00f6rsta \u00e4lgarna i bild!\u201d which translates to \u201cFirst moose on camera!\u201d \u2014 as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.",
      "\u201dI would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: \u2018Go on! Yes, you can do it!\u2019\" Malmgren said.",
      "Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible.",
      "\u201cI was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, \u2018What, you saw moose in the city?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No, it\u2019s on the TV,\u2019\u201d Garp Liljefors said.",
      "Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move.",
      "\u201cWhen someone asks me, \u2018What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it\u2019s the great migration,\u2019\" she said. \"They know.\u201d",

      "Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the disgraced movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations",
      "NEW YORK -- Five years after Harvey Weinstein was convicted of rape and hauled to jail in handcuffs, the former movie mogul returns to a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday for a new trial covering the very same allegations \u2014 plus one that hasn't been tried before.",
      "It isn\u2019t double jeopardy, but rather a legal redo after a New York appeals court overturned the landmark #MeToo verdict a year ago.",
      "The state\u2019s Court of Appeals threw out Weinstein\u2019s convictions and 23-year prison sentence and ordered a new trial after finding that the original one was tilted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "Jury selection could take a few days. Opening statements and the start of testimony are expected next week. Judge Curtis Farber said that in addition to 12 jurors, six alternates will be picked. Prosecutors expect the retrial to last a month.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Weinstein\u2019s retrial:",
      "In some ways, the new trial will be two trials spliced into one.",
      "Weinstein, 73, faces charges involving two women from his original trial in 2020, Jessica Mann and Miriam Haley, and he\u2019s being tried for the first time on an allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t in the first case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies that he raped or sexually assaulted anyone. Prosecutors are not allowed to retry Weinstein on certain counts that he was acquitted of during his first trial, including charges of predatory sexual assault and one count of first-degree rape.",
      "The judicial reboot will play out in a different climate than Weinstein\u2019s first trial, which drew intense media attention and saw protesters chanting \u201crapist\u201d outside the courthouse.",
      "The #MeToo movement, spawned by scores of allegations in 2017 against the ex-studio boss, has evolved and ebbed over time, and Weinstein has since been convicted in a separate rape case in Los Angeles \u2014 a verdict he is also appealing.",
      "While some stars are still facing a legal reckoning for alleged sexual misconduct \u2013 like Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, who is set to go to trial next month \u2013 the drumbeat of allegations against powerful figures has abated from #MeToo\u2019s early days.",
      "Weinstein is being retried on two charges from his original trial: one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006 and one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Haley, a former production assistant on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway,\u201d testified at the 2020 trial that he pushed her onto a bed at his Manhattan apartment in June 2006 and forced oral sex on her, undeterred by her kicks and pleas of, \u201cNo, please don\u2019t do this, I don\u2019t want it.\u201d",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, acknowledged that she kept in touch with Weinstein, exchanged warm messages with him, and accepted an invitation to his hotel room two weeks after the alleged assault, where he pulled her into bed for sex. Under New York law applicable at the time, Weinstein has not being charged with rape in connection with Haley\u2019s allegations.",
      "Mann, who said she saw Weinstein as a \u201cpseudo father\u201d figure as she pursued an acting career after a rough upbringing, testified at the 2020 trial that he trapped her in a hotel room in March 2013, ordered her to undress as he loomed over her, and then raped her. She alleges that Weinstein raped her again eight months later at a Beverly Hills hotel, where she worked as a hairdresser.",
      "Mann also kept in touch with Weinstein after the alleged assault, testifying that she sent him flattering emails, because \u201chis ego was so fragile,\u201d she said, and it \u201cmade me feel safe, worshipping him in this sense.\u201d",
      "In addition to Haley and Mann, Weinstein is also charged with one count of criminal sex act for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006.",
      "That woman, who was not part of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, has not been named publicly. The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Prosecutors said that the woman came forward to them just days before the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial but was not part of that case. They said they did not pursue the women\u2019s allegations after Weinstein's conviction, but revisited them and secured a new indictment after the first verdict was thrown out.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers contend that prosecutors shouldn't have waited nearly five years to bring the additional charge.",
      "New York\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals, threw out Weinstein\u2019s conviction in April 2024.",
      "In a 4-3 decision, the court said then-Judge James Burke had denied Weinstein a fully fair trial by letting three women testify about allegations that weren\u2019t part of the case and his decision to let prosecutors confront Weinstein, if he had testified, over his history of brutish behavior.",
      "The court labeled the allegations against Weinstein \u201cappalling, shameful, repulsive conduct\u201d but warned that \u201cdestroying a defendant\u2019s character under the guise of prosecutorial need\u201d did not justify some trial evidence and testimony. Burke\u2019s term expired at the end of 2022, and he is no longer a judge.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Court of Appeals Judge Madeline Singas wrote that her colleagues in the majority were continuing a \u201cdisturbing trend of overturning juries\u2019 guilty verdicts in cases involving sexual violence.\u201d",
      "The ruling came at \u201cthe expense and safety of women,\u201d she wrote.",

      "SAN ANTONIO -- A Texas rapper who performed as Tay-K and was best known for his 2017 single \u201cThe Race\u201d was convicted of murder for a second time after a jury found him guilty of fatally shooting a San Antonio man.",
      "Taymor McIntyre faces up to life in prison with the possibility of parole for the killing of 23-year-old Mark Anthony Saldivar in 2017. McIntyre had already been been serving a 55-year sentence over a separate fatal shooting.",
      "Prosecutors said that McIntyre shot Saldivar after the rapper tried to rob him. Authorities said McIntyre had picked up Saldivar, who was a photographer, in a car after asking him to take photos of the rapper for a new song.",
      "McIntyre\u2019s attorneys had criticized the police investigation of the shooting, alleging the case relied too much on self-serving statements from witnesses in the car when the shooting happened.",
      "\u201cTaymor McIntyre is not guilty of capital murder, murder, or manslaughter, and the reason for that is very simple,\u201d John Hunter, one of McIntyre\u2019s attorneys, told jurors during closing arguments last week. \u201cYou have to do it right. You have to do the work. And this case clearly demonstrates the work wasn\u2019t done.\u201d",
      "The jury found McIntyre not guilty of capital murder, which would have meant a life sentence without the chance of parole. The jury will now hear evidence in the trial\u2019s punishment phase before deciding on a sentence.",
      "McIntyre was also convicted in 2019 for the shooting death of 21-year-old Ethan Walker during a home invasion in 2016 in Mansfield, southeast of Fort Worth, Texas.",

      "Where you live, what you\u2019re allergic to and your lifestyle can make a big difference when it comes to the severity of your allergies. Experts say climate change is leading to longer and more intense allergy seasons, but also point out that treatments for seasonal allergies have become more effective over the last decade.",
      "Here are some tips from experts to keep allergy symptoms at bay \u2014 maybe even enough to allow you to enjoy the outdoors.",
      "The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America issues an annual ranking of the most challenging cities to live in if you have allergies, based on over-the-counter medicine use, pollen counts and the number of available allergy specialists.",
      "This year, the top five cities are: Wichita, Kansas; New Orleans; Oklahoma City; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and Memphis.",
      "There are three main types of pollen. Earlier in the spring, tree pollen is the main culprit. After that grasses pollinate, followed by weeds in the late summer and early fall.",
      "Some of the most common tree pollens that cause allergies include birch, cedar, cottonwood, maple, elm, oak and walnut, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Grasses that cause symptoms include Bermuda, Johnson, rye and Kentucky bluegrass.",
      "Pollen trackers can help you decide when to go outside. The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology tracks levels through a network of counting stations across the U.S. Counts are available at its website and via email.",
      "The best and first step to controlling allergies is avoiding exposure. Keep the windows in your car and your home closed, even when it\u2019s nice outside.",
      "If you go outside, wearing long sleeves can keep pollen off your skin to help ward off allergic reactions, said Dr. James Baker, an allergist at the University of Michigan. It also provides some sun protection, he added.",
      "When you get home, change your clothes and shower daily to ensure all the pollen is off of you \u2014 including your hair. If you can\u2019t wash your hair every day, try covering it when you go outside with a hat or scarf. Don\u2019t get in the bed with your outside clothes on, because the pollen will follow.",
      "It's also useful to rinse your eyes and nose with saline to remove any pollen, experts said. And the same masks that got us through the pandemic can protect you from allergies \u2014 though they won\u2019t help with eye symptoms.",
      "Over-the-counter nasal sprays are among the most effective treatments for seasonal allergies, experts said.",
      "But the vast majority of patients use them incorrectly, irritating parts of the nose, said Dr. Kathleen Mays, an allergist at Augusta University in Georgia. She suggested angling the nozzle outward toward your ear rather than sticking it straight up your nose.",
      "Over-the-counter allergy pills like Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec are helpful, but may not be as effective as quickly since they're taken by mouth, experts said.",
      "Experts also said that if your allergy symptoms are impacting your quality of life, like causing you to lose sleep or a lack focus at work or school, it might be time to consider an allergist appointment for immunotherapies.",
      "Some remedies for allergy relief that have been circulating on social media or suggested by celebrities \u2014 like incorporating local honey into your diet to expose yourself to pollen \u2014 have been debunked.",
      "Dr. Shayam Joshi, an allergist at Oregon Health and Science University, said that's because the flowers that bees pollinate typically don't contain the airborne pollen that causes allergy symptoms.",
      "With climate change, winters are milder and growing seasons are longer, meaning there\u2019s more opportunity for pollen to stay in the air, resulting in longer and more severe allergy seasons.",
      "In many areas across the country, pollen counts have broken decades of records. In late March, the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Center measured a pollen count of over 14,000 grains per cubic meter, which is considered extremely high.",

      "WASHINGTON -- First the nation\u2019s top law firms. Then its premier universities. Now, President Donald Trump is leaning on the advocacy groups that underpin U.S. civil society.",
      "Trump said Thursday that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status not just of Harvard, but environmental groups and specifically the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. It could be a devastating financial blow to the nonprofit organizations \u2014 and his perceived political foes.",
      "The president\u2019s remarks, during an event at the White House, began to confirm what advocacy groups have been quietly warning: Trump\u2019s campaign of retribution is coming next for them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said about CREW, in particular. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have been working their way through the nation\u2019s institutions, threatening to chisel away at the independence and autonomy of the law firms, college campuses and now advocacy groups \u2014 or putting them at risk of losing their federal funds or professional livelihood.",
      "It's all coming quickly, not yet 100 days into the new administration, and in ways historically unheard of in this country for their speed and scope. And it's sending shock waves reverberating throughout the American system.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day in this country when organizations that provide critical services to their communities are under attack from their government,\u201d said Cole Leiter, executive director of the advocacy group Americans Against Government Censorship. \u201cNo administration, Republican or Democratic, should be able to weaponize the weight of the government against their political enemies.\"",
      "On their own, Trump's actions are an almost daily list of executive pronouncements from the White House. The Trump administration has issued orders against the law firms that had cases or attorneys perceived to be against him, and it has made demands of the universities over their rules around campus activism.",
      "Thursday brought potentially more to the stack: Trump singled out CREW, the watchdog group whose founder, Norm Eisen, played a pivotal role in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, and the environmental groups that largely stand at odds with his \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d agenda.",
      "\u201cTax exempt status \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s really a privilege, and it\u2019s been abused by a lot more than Harvard,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be making some statements. It\u2019s a big deal.\u201d",
      "But taken together, the executive orders and actions and memos are making one thing clear: The Trump administration is eager to test new ways to flex executive power, and dare the courts and Congress to intervene. And there\u2019s more expected to come.",
      "Environmental, immigration and civil society advocacy groups have been bracing for potential threats to their tax-exempt status, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss it. The person said some expect Trump might start taking action against the environmental groups on Earth Day, which is Tuesday.",
      "These are the largely nonprofit organizations and groups, many based in Washington, advocating for various communities, constituencies and causes.",
      "Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, said environmental groups have heard that the Trump administration is preparing executive orders targeting the tax status of environmental groups that work on climate change, as well as that of any foundations that fund their work.",
      "\u201cTrump is marshaling all the power of government to punish his perceived enemies,\" Suckling said. \"We\u2019ve got a crack legal team and will have him in court within 24 hours. We\u2019re ready and waiting for him to come at us.\u201d",
      "CREW has been a leading ethics group in Washington, with Trump long the subject of its probes.",
      "Ahead of the 2024 election, the group was part of the legal effort to disqualify Trump from regaining the White House under the 14th Amendment, in the aftermath of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. More recently, CREW sued over the firing of federal workers by Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cFor more than 20 years, CREW has exposed government corruption from politicians of both parties who violate the public trust and has worked to promote an ethical, transparent government,\" said Jordan Libowitz, the organization's vice president.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on civil society have created a climate that is potentially chilling for the organizations in question \u2014 but they have had mixed results.",
      "Five of the major law firms and Trump reached a deal in which they agreed to provide a combined hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono counsel to causes the administration says it supports. The firms are trying to avoid various sanctions, including terminated federal contracts, federal employment investigations over diversity hiring and others.",
      "While Columbia University agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s demands to overhaul its rules for public protests rather than risk billions of dollars in lost federal funds, Harvard rebuffed the administration and now faces a $2 billion federal funding freeze and the threat to its tax-exempt status.",
      "The tax-exempt status allows nonprofit organizations to receive donations that are crucial to their financial bottom line. Changing that could, in some situations, lead to calamity.",
      "\u201cGood governance groups are the heart of a healthy democracy,\" Libowitz said. \"We will continue to do our work to ensure Americans have an ethical and accountable government.\u201d",

      "Taking a mental health leave from work is becoming more of an option for people in the United States even thought most of them probably don't know it",
      "NEW YORK -- Her first panic attack came at a company-wide meeting, right before her scheduled presentation. Carolina Lasso had given many similar talks about her marketing team's accomplishments. When her name was called this time, she couldn\u2019t speak.",
      "\u201cI felt a knot in my throat,\u201d Lasso said. \u201cMy head, it felt like it was inside a bubble. I couldn\u2019t hear, I couldn\u2019t see, and it felt like an eternity. It was just a few seconds, but it was so profound, and in a way earth-shattering to me.\u201d",
      "Lasso was struggling after a cross-country move followed by a divorce. Her boss suggested a mental health leave, a possibility she didn\u2019t know existed. She worried whether taking time off would affect how her team viewed her or cost her a future promotion, but in the end she did.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thankful for that opportunity to take the time to heal,\" Lasso, 43, said. \u201cMany people feel guilty when they take a leave of absence when it\u2019s mental health-related. ... There is some extra weight that we carry on our shoulders, as if it had been our fault.\u201d",
      "Despite a fear of repercussions, more adults are recognizing that stepping back from work to deal with emotional burdens or psychological conditions that get in the way of their lives is a necessary choice, one that a growing number of employers recognize.",
      "ComPsych Corp., a provider of employee mental health programs and absence management services, encourages its business clients to make the well-being of workers a priority before individuals get to a breaking point while also having processes in place for those who require leaves of absence.",
      "\u201cSince the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, collectively we\u2019ve just been in this constant state of turmoil,\u201d Jennifer Birdsall, the senior clinical director at ComPysch, said. \u201cWe just have had this barrage of change and uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Depression, anxiety and adjustment disorder, which involves excessive reactions to stress, were the top three diagnoses of employees who took mental health leaves in the past two years among clients of Alight, a Chicago-based technology company which administers leaves and benefits for large employers.",
      "A mental health leave can last weeks or months. In some cases, workers get approval to work a reduced schedule or to take short periods of time off when needed, using an approach called \u201cintermittent leave.\u201d",
      "At most U.S. organizations with 50 or more employees, people can request leaves through the Family and Medical Leave Act. The federal law entitles workers with serious health conditions to paid or unpaid leaves of up to 12 weeks, depending on state and local laws.",
      "Some employers require people to use sick days or accumulated vacation days to continue receiving a paycheck while out. For longer leaves, workers can access short-term disability plans, if their employer offers one.",
      "Lasso's leave lasted six months, and included therapy and travel to India for additional treatment. She returned to her job but decided after a year to leave for good. She later launched a business to train people on fostering a more humane work culture.",
      "A mental health leave is \u201cnot only OK, but it can really unlock new possibilities once we have the time to do the work \u2014 therapy, medication, whatever it is \u2014 and have enough distance from work to be able to reconnect with ourselves,\u201d Lasso said.",
      "A social stigma around mental health challenges causes many people to avoid seeking treatment or requesting a leave of absence. Newton Cheng, director of health and performance at Google, hopes to change that by sharing his own struggles.",
      "His first self-disclosure happened during the pandemic, when a senior manager invited employees at a meeting to share how they were doing. When it was his turn, Cheng started crying.",
      "He explained he was struggling to live up to his expectations of himself as a father and didn't know how to turn things around.",
      "\u201cIt was just totally horrifying to me because, one, I had just cried in front of my coworkers and I was definitely taught as a professional \u2014 and as a man \u2014 you do not do that,\" Cheng recalled. \"And then two, I had never really articulated and said out loud those words. I hadn\u2019t even allowed myself to think that. But now they\u2019re out there and I had to face them.\u201d",
      "Colleagues responded by relaying their own struggles, but Cheng's difficulties continued. By February 2021, he couldn't get out of bed because he felt paralyzed by dread, he said. A therapist said he was showing symptoms of major depression and anxiety.",
      "\u201cI just realized, \u2018I\u2019m struggling a lot and this goes pretty deep. I don\u2019t think I can keep just putting duct tape on this. I probably need to take some leave,\u2019\u201d Cheng recalled.",
      "Hoping his decision would benefit others, he announced to 200 people at a conference that he planned to take mental health leave. Instead of derailing the gathering as he feared, his honesty inspired fellow conference attendees to open up.",
      "\"It was like a fireworks show,\u201d Cheng said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Wow, I can\u2019t believe he did that.\u2019 Then they forgot about me. But the tone was set. It was like \u2019Oh, this is what we\u2019re doing. Let me talk about what\u2019s going on with me, too.'\u201d",
      "While balancing classes and a full-time job during her last year of college, Rosalie Mae began struggling to get out of bed and crying uncontrollably. Yet she felt like she had \u201cto keep it together\u201d to avoid burdening her colleagues at the University of Utah bookstore, where Mae worked as an accounting clerk.",
      "Then she found herself calling a suicide hotline. \u201cOnce it reached that point, I knew, especially at the urging of my husband, we need to do something more,\u201d Mae, 24, said.",
      "In her case, that meant taking a five-week work leave to put her own health and well-being first. She recommends the same for others who find themselves in a similar position.",
      "\u201cTaking a mental health leave is not necessarily a cure-all, but it is important to give yourself a break and allow yourself to regroup, make a plan of how to proceed and take the steps to work towards feeling better,\" Mae said.",
      "Before broaching the subject of a mental health leave with a manager, consider the workplace culture and the strength of your professional relationships, Cheng said. He recalls saying, \u201cFor my health and well-being, and the sake of my family and what's best for the business, the least risky thing for me to do is to go on leave soon.\u201d",
      "Individuals who suspect an unsympathetic reception can simply say, \u201cI need to go on medical leave. I need time to recover,\u201d he advised.",
      "There's also no legal or ethical requirement to tell everyone you work with the nature of your leave.",
      "\u201cYour coworkers don't need to know why,\u201d said Seth Turner, co-founder of AbsenceSoft, a leave and accommodation management solutions provider. \u201cThey just need to know, 'I\u2019m going to be here at this time, and I'm going to be gone at this time, and I'll be back.'\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.K. Supreme Court has ruled that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition",
      "LONDON -- In a judgment with far-reaching implications, the U.K. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a woman is someone born biologically female and that transgender women are excluded from that legal definition.",
      "The ruling was cheered by some feminists who have campaigned to safeguard rights for women on the basis of biological sex. Trans rights campaigners were disappointed, and worry about the ruling's implications for transgender women.",
      "The court was asked to determine the definition of a woman under Britain\u2019s 2010 Equality Act, which sets out protections against discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, race, religion and other traits.",
      "The case stems from a 2018 law passed by the Scottish Parliament calling for 50% female representation on the boards of Scottish public bodies. Its definition of women included trans women whose gender is legally affirmed with a Gender Recognition Certificate.",
      "A feminist group, For Women Scotland, challenged that in court, saying the Scottish government had overstepped its powers by effectively redefining the meaning of \u201cwoman.\u201d",
      "The group lost a ruling in a Scottish court in 2022 but was later granted permission to take its case to the Supreme Court, which held hearings in November.",
      "Justice Patrick Hodge said he and four other judges ruled unanimously that \u201cthe terms woman and sex in the Equality Act refer to a biological woman.\u201d",
      "In the law, \u201cthe words \u2018sex,\u2019 \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018man\u2019 \u2026 mean (and were always intended to mean) biological sex, biological woman and biological man,\u201d the judges wrote.",
      "The judges argued that a broader definition that includes transgender people would make the Equality Act \u201cincoherent and unworkable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can identify no good reason why the legislature should have intended that sex-based rights and protections under the (Equality Act) should apply to these complex, heterogenous groupings, rather than to the distinct group of (biological) women and girls (or men and boys) with their shared biology leading to shared disadvantage and discrimination faced by them as a distinct group,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The ruling makes no mention of intersex people, who also are not explicitly protected under the Equality Act.",
      "As in other countries, the issue has polarized opinion, pitting transgender rights campaigners against \u201cgender critical\u201d feminists, who argue that trans women's rights should not come at the expense of those who are born biologically female.",
      "For Women Scotland said it was \u201cabsolutely jubilant\u201d at the ruling. \u201cHarry Potter\u201d author J.K. Rowling, a prominent supporter of the group, said the court victory had \u201cprotected the rights of women and girls across the U.K.\u201d",
      "But LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said there is \u201cdeep concern\u201d surrounding the ruling's consequences.",
      "Vic Valentine, manager of the group Scottish Trans, said the judgment \u201cseems to have totally missed what matters to trans people \u2014 that we are able to live our lives, and be recognized, in line with who we truly are.\u201d",
      "Amnesty International U.K. described the ruling as \u201cdisappointing,\u201d but said it is \u201cimportant to stress that the court has been clear that trans people are protected under the Equality Act against discrimination and harassment.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court judges stressed that their ruling should not be seen as an attack on transgender people. They said it \u201cdoes not remove or diminish the important protections \u2026 for trans people\u201d under the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender people.",
      "It\u2019s unclear what the ruling will mean in practice.",
      "The judgment highlights a range of spaces and services that could be intended just for women, including \u201crape or domestic violence counselling, domestic violence refuges, rape crisis centers, female-only hospital wards and changing rooms.\u201d The law already allowed for trans women to be excluded from single-sex spaces under certain circumstances, but Wednesday\u2019s ruling appears to make such a ban easier.",
      "The ruling could also see transgender female athletes excluded from participating in women\u2019s and girls sports, and there could also be ramifications in workplaces.",
      "But much depends on how the ruling is interpreted and implemented.",
      "Hannah Ford, an employment partner at law firm Stevens & Bolton, told the BBC that because of the ruling, ensuring workplaces are welcoming places for trans people will be \u201can uphill battle.\u201d",
      "She said one positive aspect was that \u201cat least we have simplicity and clarity. So it is in one sense a triumph of sense over legal incoherency and legal fiction.\u201d",

      "The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, estimates in a report released Tuesday that the overall number of clinician-provided abortions in states where it's legal rose by less than 1% from 2023 to 2024.",
      "But the number of people crossing state lines for abortions dropped by about 9%.",
      "The report, based on a monthly survey of providers, is the latest look at how the abortion landscape in the U.S. has evolved since the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022 in a ruling that eliminated a national constitutional right to abortion and opened the door to state bans and restrictions.",
      "Guttmacher estimates there were 1.04 million abortions in 2024, up about 1% from its total the previous year.",
      "Multiple studies have found that the total number of abortions in the U.S. has risen since Dobbs, despite some states implementing bans.",
      "Twelve states currently enforce abortion bans with limited exceptions at all stages of pregnancy. Four more have bans that kick in after about six weeks, which is before many women know they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "Guttmacher's tally does not capture self-managed abortions such as people obtaining abortion pills from community networks, foreign pharmacies or through telehealth from medical providers in states that have laws intended to protect those who send pills into places with bans. There\u2019s a court battle over the constitutionality of such laws. But another survey found that the number of telehealth pills being sent into states with bans has been growing and accounted for about 1 in 10 abortions in the U.S. by the summer of 2024.",

      "A working paper released in March provided different insight into the impact of the bans.",
      "It found that birth rates rose from 2020 to 2023 in counties farther from abortion clinics. Rates rose faster for Black and Hispanic women, those with lower education levels, and people who are unmarried.",
      "\u201cThe takeaway is that distance still matters,\u201d said Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economic professor and one of the authors of the working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cIt really wasn\u2019t obvious that that would be the case.\u201d",

      "For older people with dementia, boarding can be especially dangerous, Chicago-based geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Shafi Siddiqui said. One research letter published in June 2024 in the Journal of the American Medical Association looked at more than 200,000 patients and found long ER stays could be linked to a higher risk of dementia patients developing delirium \u2014 a temporary state of mental confusion and sometimes hallucinations.",
      "\u201cPeople need to be enraged about (boarding),\u201d said Dr. Vicki Norton, president-elect of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine.",
      "National emergency physician groups have lobbied for years to keep boarding under control. While they\u2019ve made some progress, nothing substantial has changed, despite concerns that it leads to worse patient outcomes.",
      "Dr. Alison Haddock, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians, said that\u2019s because boarding is a failing of the entire health care system that manifests in the ER, so solving it demands a systemic approach.",
      "Federal and state policy decisions made nearly 40 years ago limited the number of hospital beds, said Arjun Venkatesh, who studies emergency medicine at Yale. People are now living longer, he said, resulting in more complicated illnesses.",
      "In 2003, there were 965,000 staffed hospital beds compared to 913,000 in 2023, according to the American Hospital Association. And another JAMA research letter published in February shows there are 16% fewer staffed beds in the U.S. post-pandemic.",
      "The ones available may be prioritized for \u201cscheduled care\u201d patients who need non-urgent procedures, like cancer care or orthopedic surgeries. Insurance companies pay hospitals more for those surgeries, Haddock said, so hospitals aren\u2019t likely to move patients into those beds \u2014 even as emergency rooms fill up.",
      "Though long stays in the emergency department are common, there isn\u2019t good data that tracks the extremes, emergency medicine experts said.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently ended a requirement that hospitals track the \u201cmedian\u201d wait times in their emergency departments. An advisory group that develops quality measures for CMS recommended that the agency try to more accurately capture long emergency department stays. That measure has recently been submitted to CMS, which can choose to adopt it.",
      "Patients\u2019 families worry that long emergency room stays may make things worse for their loved ones, forcing some to search for limited alternatives to turn for support and care.",
      "Nancy Fregeau lives in Kankakee, Illinois, with her husband Michael Reeman, who has dementia.",
      "Last year, she said he visited the Riverside Medical Center emergency department several times, often staying more than four hours and in one case more than 10, before finally getting access to a behavioral care bed. Riverside declined to comment on Reeman\u2019s case.",
      "During long waits, Fregeau doesn\u2019t know what reassurance she can offer her husband.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard enough for anyone to be in the ER but I cannot imagine someone with dementia being in there,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just kept saying \u2018When am I going? What\u2019s happening?\u2019\u201d",
      "Since November, Reeman has been going to the MCA Senior Adult Day Center in Kankakee. Fregeau said Reeman treats the day center like it\u2019s his job, offering to vacuum and clean, but comes home happier after having time around other people and away from the house.",
      "In Illinois, there are fewer adult day centers than there are counties, and other resources for people with dementia are shrinking, too. A report from the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living found that 1,000 nursing homes in the U.S. closed between 2015 and 2022. At least 15 behavioral health centers, which are facilities that specialize in treating mental health issues, closed in 2023.",
      "With fewer places for patients to go after being discharged, hospital beds are being used for longer, exacerbating the boarding problem. It\u2019s becoming more difficult to get a specialty hospital bed, especially when patients\u2019 dementia causes aggression.",
      "That was the case for Balhan\u2019s father, who became increasingly agitated during his ER stay. Hospital staff told Balhan the behavioral care unit wasn\u2019t taking dementia patients, so Speer was stuck in the ER for 24 hours until they found a behavioral health facility, separate from the health system, that would take him.",
      "While the hospital couldn\u2019t comment on Speer\u2019s specific situation, Endeavor Health spokesperson Spencer Walrath said its behavioral care unit typically admits geriatric psychiatry patients, including those with dementia, but it depends on factors like bed availability and the patient\u2019s specific medical needs.",
      "Balhan feels that the U.S. health care system failed to treat her dad as a human being.",
      "\"It didn\u2019t feel to me like he was being treated with any dignity as a person,\u201d she said. \u201cIf anything could change, that would be the change that I would want to see.\"",

      "A man has been arrested near UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters after threatening violence",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A man was arrested near UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters in Minnesota after threatening violence, months after the company's CEO was killed, authorities said Monday.",
      "The man was spotted around 11 a.m. in a parking lot outside of the UnitedHealthcare corporate campus in the Minneapolis suburb of Minnetonka. City spokesman Andy Wittenborg said the man contacted the FBI's field office in Minneapolis once he arrived, and an FBI negotiator made contact with him by phone.",
      "\u201cWhile the investigation is still in its early stages, there is currently no indication that the individual had specific grievances against UnitedHealthcare,\u201d Wittenborg said in a statement.",
      "City police and the FBI coordinated their response and had steady contact with the man, successfully encouraging him to peacefully surrender to authorities after about an hour with no threat to the public, Wittenborg said. The man, who'd had previous contacts with Minnetonka police, had showed up at a security checkpoint where he was not supposed to be.",
      "Wittenborg said the incident had nothing to do with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot to death in New York City on Dec. 4 as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan. The man accused of killing him, Luigi Mangione, 26, pleaded not guilty in December to state murder and terror charges.",
      "News helicopter video of the aftermath showed over a dozen law enforcement vehicles from multiple agencies at the scene, as well as an ambulance that was standing by. There were no reports of injuries.",
      "The CEO\u2019s killing and ensuing manhunt leading to Mangione\u2019s arrest rattled the business community, with some health insurers hastily switching to remote work or online shareholder meetings. It also galvanized health insurance critics \u2014 some of whom rallied around Mangione as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills.",
      "Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind. Police say the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims.",
      "Mangione also faces federal charges, and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said earlier this month she has directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty.",

      "A private plane that crashed in upstate New York over the weekend was carrying six members of a close-knit family of physicians and distinguished student-athletes on a trip to the Catskills for a birthday celebration and the Passover holiday.",
      "The twin-engine Mitsubishi MU-2B went down shortly after noon Saturday in a muddy field in Copake, New York, near the Massachusetts line, killing everyone on board, according to authorities and a family member who spoke to The Associated Press.",
      "Shortly before the crash, the pilot had radioed air traffic control at Columbia County Airport to say he had missed the initial approach and requested a new approach plan, officials with the National Transportation Safety Board said at a Sunday briefing. While preparing the new coordinates, air traffic controllers attempted to relay a low altitude alert three times, with no response from the pilot and no distress call, officials said.",
      "Investigators obtained video of the final seconds of the flight, which \u201cappears to show that the aircraft was intact and crashed at a high rate of descent into the ground,\u201d NTSB official Todd Inman told reporters.",
      "Among the victims were Karenna Groff, a former MIT soccer player named the 2022 NCAA woman of the year; her father, a neuroscientist, Dr. Michael Groff; her mother, Dr. Joy Saini, a urogynecologist; her brother, Jared Groff, a 2022 graduate of Swarthmore College who worked as a paralegal; Alexia Couyutas Duarte, Jared Groff's partner who also graduated Swarthmore and planned to attend Harvard Law School this fall; and Karenna Groff's boyfriend, James Santoro, another recent MIT graduate, according to a family statement Sunday.",
      "\u201cThey were a wonderful family,\u201d James' father, John Santoro, told AP. \u201cThe world lost a lot of very good people who were going to do a lot of good for the world if they had the opportunity. We\u2019re all personally devastated.\u201d",
      "Santoro said his son first met Karenna Groff as a freshman studying at MIT. Groff, who grew up in Weston, Massachusetts, was an All-American soccer player studying biomedical engineering. Santoro, a math major from New Jersey, played lacrosse for the school.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Karenna Groff co-founded openPPE, helping to create a new design of masks for essential workers. In 2023, she received the prestigious NCAA woman of the year award for the previous year for her on- and off-field accomplishments.",
      "\u201cReally, this recognition is a testament to my MIT women\u2019s soccer family and all of the guidance, support, and friendship they have provided for me over the years,\u201d she said in an interview at the time.",
      "After graduating, Santoro and Groff moved to Manhattan, where Groff enrolled in medical school at New York University and Santoro worked as an investment associate for Silver Point, a hedge fund based in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "India-born Saini was an accomplished pelvic surgeon and the founder of Boston Pelvic Health and Wellness, according to the family statement. She trained in medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, where she met Michael Groff, who became a distinguished neurosurgeon and experienced pilot, the statement said.",
      "On Saturday morning, they all headed to Westchester County Airport in White Plains, a suburb of New York City, where they boarded Michael Groff's private plane, according to John Santoro.",
      "They were set to land at Columbia County Airport but crashed roughly 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the south. The plane was \u201ccompressed, buckled and embedded in the terrain\u201d of a muddy agricultural field, Inman said.",
      "The pilot was flying under instrument flight rules, rather than visual flight rules, but it was too soon to determine if reduced visibility from weather conditions were a factor, he said.",
      "The plane had been sold a year ago and had an upgraded cockpit with newer technology that was certified to Federal Aviation Administration standards, according to the NTSB.",
      "Investigators expect to be at the crash site for about a week and a full accident report could take between 12 and 24 months to complete, Inman said.",
      "Funeral arrangements were underway, Santoro said.",
      "\u201cThe 25 years we had with James were the best years of our lives,\u201d he added, \u201cand the joy and love he brought us will be enough to last a lifetime.\u201d",

      "Land mines and other unexploded remnants of war continue to pose a deadly threat across Syria, causing widespread casualties and long-term harm",
      "IDLIB, Syria -- Suleiman Khalil was harvesting olives in a Syrian orchard with two friends four months ago, unaware the soil beneath them still hid deadly remnants of war.",
      "The trio suddenly noticed a visible mine lying on the ground. Panicked, Khalil and his friends tried to leave, but he stepped on a land mine and it exploded. His friends, terrified, ran to find an ambulance, but Khalil, 21, thought they had abandoned him.",
      "\"I started crawling, then the second land mine exploded,\u201d Khalil told The Associated Press. \u201cAt first, I thought I'd died. I didn\u2019t think I would survive this.\u201d",
      "Khalil\u2019s left leg was badly wounded in the first explosion, while his right leg was blown off from above the knee in the second. He used his shirt to tourniquet the stump and screamed for help until a soldier nearby heard him and rushed for his aid.",
      "\u201cThere were days I didn\u2019t want to live anymore,\u201d Khalil said, sitting on a thin mattress, his amputated leg still wrapped in a white cloth four months after the incident. Khalil, who is from the village of Qaminas, in the southern part of Syria\u2019s Idlib province, is engaged and dreams of a prosthetic limb so he can return to work and support his family again.",
      "While the nearly 14-year Syrian civil war came to an end with the fall of Bashar Assad on Dec. 8, war remnants continue to kill and maim. Contamination from land mines and explosive remnants has killed at least 249 people, including 60 children, and injured another 379 since Dec. 8, according to INSO, an international organization which coordinates safety for aid workers.",
      "Mines and explosive remnants \u2014 widely used since 2011 by Syrian government forces, its allies, and armed opposition groups \u2014 have contaminated vast areas, many of which only became accessible after the Assad government\u2019s collapse, leading to a surge in the number of land mine casualties, according to a recent Human Rights Watch (HRW) report.",
      "Prior to Dec. 8, land mines and explosive remnants of war also frequently injured or killed civilians returning home and accessing agricultural land.",
      "\u201cWithout urgent, nationwide clearance efforts, more civilians returning home to reclaim critical rights, lives, livelihoods, and land will be injured and killed,\u201d said Richard Weir, a senior crisis and conflict researcher at HRW.",
      "Experts estimate that tens of thousands of land mines remain buried across Syria, particularly in former front-line regions like rural Idlib.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t even have an exact number,\u201d said Ahmad Jomaa, a member of a demining unit under Syria's defense ministry. \u201cIt will take ages to clear them all.\u201d",
      "Jomaa spoke while scanning farmland in a rural area east of Maarrat al-Numan with a handheld detector, pointing at a visible anti-personnel mine nestled in dry soil.",
      "\u201cThis one can take off a leg,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to detonate it manually.\u201d",
      "Farming remains the main source of income for residents in rural Idlib, making the presence of mines a daily hazard. Days earlier a tractor exploded nearby, severely injuring several farm workers, Jomaa said. \u201cMost of the mines here are meant for individuals and light vehicles, like the ones used by farmers,\u201d he said.",
      "Jomaa\u2019s demining team began dismantling the mines immediately after the previous government was ousted. But their work comes at a steep cost.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had 15 to 20 (deminers) lose limbs, and around a dozen of our brothers were killed doing this job,\u201d he said. Advanced scanners, needed to detect buried or improvised devices, are in short supply, he said. Many land mines are still visible to the naked eye, but others are more sophisticated and harder to detect.",
      "Land mines not only kill and maim but also cause long-term psychological trauma and broader harm, such as displacement, loss of property, and reduced access to essential services, HRW says.",
      "The rights group has urged the transitional government to establish a civilian-led mine action authority in coordination with the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) to streamline and expand demining efforts.",
      "Syria's military under the Assad government laid explosives years ago to deter opposition fighters. Even after the government seized nearby territories, it made little effort to clear the mines it left behind.",
      "Standing before his brother\u2019s grave, Salah Sweid holds up a photo on his phone of Mohammad, smiling behind a pile of dismantled mines. \u201cMy mother, like any other mother would do, warned him against going,\u201d Salah said. \u201cBut he told them, \u2018If I don\u2019t go and others don\u2019t go, who will? Every day someone is dying.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mohammad was 39 when he died on Jan. 12 while demining in a village in Idlib. A former Syrian Republican Guard member trained in planting and dismantling mines, he later joined the opposition during the uprising, scavenging weapon debris to make arms.",
      "He worked with Turkish units in Azaz, a city in northwest Syria, using advanced equipment, but on the day he died, he was on his own. As he defused one mine, another hidden beneath it detonated. After Assad\u2019s ouster, mines littered his village in rural Idlib. He had begun volunteering to clear them \u2014 often without proper equipment \u2014 responding to residents\u2019 pleas for help, even on holidays when his demining team was off duty, his brother said.",
      "For every mine cleared by people like Mohammad, many more remain.",
      "In a nearby village, Jalal al-Maarouf, 22, was tending to his goats three days after the Assad government\u2019s collapse when he stepped on a mine. Fellow shepherds rushed him to a hospital, where doctors amputated his left leg.",

      "Vance will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi for talks on the economy, trade and geopolitical ties. Vance\u2019s visit is seen as an important diplomatic mission by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, and it coincides with a rapidly intensifying trade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi's main rival in the region.",
      "A trade deal between India and the U.S. could significantly enhance economic ties between the two countries and potentially strengthen diplomatic ties.",
      "The U.S. is also India\u2019s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at $190 billion until recently.",
      "India\u2019s foreign ministry has said the visit will \u201cprovide an opportunity for both sides to review the progress in bilateral relations\u201d and two leaders will \u201cexchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know more about Vance\u2019s visit:",
      "Vance\u2019s arrival in India comes weeks after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was in India for a geopolitical conference and two months after Modi met Trump in Washington.",
      "Modi was among the first leaders to visit the U.S. and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House. During his visit, Modi hailed a \u201cmega partnership\u201d with the U.S. and kickstarted a negotiation process to minimise the possible fallout of Trump\u2019s tariffs after it had already cut tariffs on a range of U.S. goods.",
      "Regardless, Trump targeted India with a 26% levy as part of his now-paused tariff programme, which has provided temporary relief for Indian exporters.",
      "During his visit, Modi sought to soften impending trade barriers by saying he was open to reducing more tariffs on U.S. goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military gear. The two countries also agreed to start talks towards clinching the bilateral trade agreement.",
      "Modi on Friday said he spoke with Elon Musk and said he and the SpaceX CEO \u201cdiscussed the immense potential for collaboration in the areas of technology and innovation,\u201d saying \u201cIndia remains committed to advancing our partnerships with the U.S. in these domains.\u201d",
      "India is a close partner of the U.S. for bilateral trade, foreign direct investments, defence cooperation, and an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "It is also part of the Quad, which is made up of the United States plus India, Japan and Australia and seen as a counter-balance to China\u2019s expansion in the region.",
      "Leading U.S companies such as Apple Inc. and Google have expanded operations in India in recent years. Last month, Musk's Starlink entered into agreements with two of India\u2019s top telecom operators to provide satellite-based internet services.",
      "To further boost trade ties, the U.S. and India have set an ambitious target of more than doubling their bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030 under the expected trade deal agreement.",
      "The negotiations are especially urgent for New Delhi as it could be hit hard by Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, particularly in sectors of agriculture, processed food, auto components, high-end machinery, medical equipment and jewelry. This poses a significant challenge for Modi government as it hopes to spruce up the country's economy and generate jobs with an export-led recovery.",
      "Modi established a good working relationship with Trump during his first term in office. It now appears that the two leaders are likely to further boost cooperation between their countries, particularly in trade as Chinese President Xi Jinping is aiming to position Beijing as a reliable trade partner in the Asia-Pacific region amid rising tensions with Washington.",
      "India has also already taken a number of steps to win over Trump. It will purchase more oil, energy and defence equipment, including the fifth-generation stealth fighter jets, from the U.S.",

      "Dozens of journalists in Belarus have been imprisoned in recent years under a crackdown by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko",
      "TALLINN, Estonia -- Journalist Ksenia Lutskina served only half of her eight-year prison sentence in Belarus after being convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the government. She was pardoned after she kept fainting in her cell from a brain tumor diagnosed during pretrial detention.",
      "\u201cI was literally brought to the penal colony in a wheelchair, and I realized that journalism has really turned into a life-threatening profession in Belarus,\u201d she told The Associated Press in Vilnius, Lithuania, where she lives.",
      "Lutskina was one of dozens of journalists imprisoned in Belarus, where many face beatings, poor medical care and the inability to contact lawyers or relatives, according to activists and former inmates. She compared the prisons to those from the Soviet era.",
      "The group Reporters Without Borders says Belarus is Europe\u2019s leading jailer of journalists. At least 40 are serving long prison sentences, according to the Belarusian Association of Journalists.",
      "Lutskina had quit her job making documentaries for Belarus' state broadcaster in 2020 when mass protests broke out after an election \u2014 widely denounced as fraudulent \u2014 kept authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in power. Trying to set up an alternative TV channel to fact-check government officials, she was arrested that year, put on trial and later convicted.",
      "Other journalists fled the country of 9.5 million and operate from abroad. But many have had to curtail their work after U.S. President Donald Trump's administration cut off foreign aid, a vital source of funding for many independent media.",
      "\"Journalists are forced to face not only repressions within the country, but also the sudden withdrawal of U.S. aid, which puts many editorial offices on the brink of survival,\u201d BAJ chair Andrei Bastunets told AP.",
      "Lukashenko's brutal crackdown after the disputed election led to over 65,000 arrests between 2020-25. Thousands told of being beaten by police, opposition figures were jailed or forced into exile, and hundreds of thousands fled abroad in fear.",
      "More than 1,200 people behind bars in the nation of 9.5 million are recognized as political prisoners by Belarus' leading rights group, Viasna. Its founder, Nobel Prize Peace laureate Ales Bialiatski, is among them.",
      "Independent journalists have been swept up too, with outlets closed or outlawed. Lukashenko, in power for over three decades, routinely calls them \u201cenemies of our state,\u201d and vows that those who fled won't be allowed to return.",
      "\u201cThe raids, arrests and abuse of journalists have been unceasing for five years, but now they have reached the point of absurdity,\" Bastunets said, noting that families of journalists are being threatened. Families of some targeted journalists have asked rights groups not to talk publicly about their cases for fear of further reprisal.",
      "Every month brings new arrests and searches, with almost all independent media leaving Belarus. The crackdown even hits those who switch their focus to nonpolitical content.",
      "In December, authorities arrested the entire editorial staff of the popular regional publication Intex-press, which covers local news in the city of Baranavichy. Seven journalists were charged with \u201cassisting extremist activity.\u201d",
      "Extremism is the most common charge used to detain, fine and jail critically minded citizens. Even reading independent media that's been declared extremist can result in short-term arrest. Working with or subscribing to banned media is seen as \u201cassisting extremism,\u201d punishable by up to seven years in prison. Websites of such outlets are blocked.",
      "According to Reporters Without Borders, 397 Belarusian journalists have been victims of what the group deems unjust arrests since 2020, with some detained multiple times.",
      "At least 600 moved abroad, the group said. Even then, many still face pressure from authorities who can open cases against them in absentia, put them on international wanted lists, seize their property inside Belarus and target relatives in raids.",
      "Reporters Without Borders filed a lawsuit with the International Criminal Court in January, accusing Belarusian authorities of \u201ccrimes against humanity,\u201d citing torture, beatings, imprisonment, persecution and forced displacement of journalists.",
      "Katsiaryna Bakhvalava, a journalist for Belsat, a Polish-Belarusian independent TV channel, was arrested while covering the 2020 protests. Initially convicted of disrupting public order and sentenced to two years. she was put on trial for treason while in a penal colony and convicted, with her sentence extended to eight years and three months.",
      "Her husband, political analyst Ihar Iliyash, was arrested in October 2024 on charges of \u201cdiscrediting Belarus\u201d and is jailed while awaiting trial.",
      "Now 31, Bakhvalava, has been placed in a \u201cpunishment isolation\u201d cell several times and in 2022 was beaten, according to a former inmate.",
      "Palina Sharenda-Panasiuk, a former political prisoner who fled to Lithuania, told reporters she heard that four prison guards had beaten Bakhvalava, who was crying and asking for a doctor.",
      "Andrzej Poczobut, a correspondent for the influential Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza and a prominent figure in the Union of Poles in Belarus, was convicted of \u201charming Belarus\u2019 national security\u201d and sentenced to eight years, which he is serving in the Novopolotsk penal colony.",
      "Poczobut, 52, suffers from a serious heart condition and was placed in solitary confinement several times, sometimes for stretches of up to six months, human rights activists said.",
      "At the end of March, his stay in a punitive cell unit \u2014 the harshest form of incarceration \u2014 was extended for six months. Attempts by Warsaw to intervene have failed and Poczobut has refused to ask Lukashenko for a pardon.",
      "Also imprisoned is Maryna Zolatava, editor of Tut.By \u2014 once the most popular online news outlet in Belarus but shut down by authorities in 2021. Zolatava was convicted in 2023 of incitement and distributing materials urging actions aimed at harming national security, and sentenced to 12 years.",
      "Lukashenko extended his rule for a seventh term in a January election that the opposition called a farce. Since July, he has pardoned over 250 people, seeking to improve ties with the West.",
      "Belarusian analyst Valery Karbalevich said Lukashenko \"views political prisoners as a commodity. He is cynically willing to sell journalists and activists to Europe and the United States in exchange for easing economic sanctions and thawing relations. And this process has already begun.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Trump began his second term, Lukashenko released two U.S. citizens and a journalist from the Belarusian service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a U.S. government-funded news outlet. Two more RFE/RL journalists, Ihar Losik and Ihar Karnei, remain imprisoned and were forced to record repentant videos.",
      "Freed journalist Andrey Kuznechyk, who spent three years in prison, left Belarus for Lithuania.",
      "\u201cThe first day after my release, I looked at the list of journalists behind bars and I was shocked by how much it had grown during my imprisonment,\u201d he told AP.",
      "Lutskina, the journalist who also fled to Lithuania, brought her 14-year-old son with her, saying he \u201cmust learn to distinguish truth from lies.\u201d They both have read George Orwell\u2019s dystopian novel \u201c1984,\u201d which was banned in Belarus, and are finding \u201csurprising parallels\u201d with her homeland.",
      "\u201cBelarus has turned into a gray country under a gray sky, where people are afraid of everything and speak in whispers,\u201d she said.",
      "Lutskina, who is being treated for the tumor that caused her fainting spells, said she actually felt less fear in prison than her fellow Belarusians outside it.",
      "They walk around with their heads down, she said, \u201cafraid to raise their eyes and see the nightmare happening around them,\u201d she added.",

    "story": [
      "A collection of Zimbabwean stone sculptures will be the centerpiece of an exhibition at Oxford University meant to \u201ccontextualize\u201d the legacy of British colonialist Cecil John Rhodes",
      "CHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe -- A pair of white hands blinding a Black face. A smiling colonizer with a Bible, crushing the skull of a screaming native with his boot. Chained men in gold mines, and a pregnant woman.",
      "These stone sculptures from Zimbabwe will take center stage at an upcoming exhibition at Oxford University in Britain, aiming to \u201ccontextualize\u201d the legacy of British imperialist Cecil John Rhodes with depictions of religious deception, forced labor and sexual abuse.",
      "Rhodes conquered large parts of southern Africa in the late 19th century. He made a fortune in gold and diamond mining and grabbed land from the local population. His grave lies under a slab of stone atop a hill in Zimbabwe.",
      "Oxford\u2019s Oriel College, where the exhibition will be held in September, is a symbolic setting. A statue of Rhodes stands there despite protests against it since 2015. Rhodes, who died in 1902, was an Oriel student who left 100,000 pounds (now valued at about 10.5 million pounds, or $13.5 million) to the school. His influence endures through a scholarship for students from southern African countries.",
      "For Zimbabwean stone carvers at Chitungwiza Arts Center near the capital, Harare, the exhibition is more than an opportunity for Western audiences to glimpse a dark history. It is also a chance to revive an ancient but struggling art form.",
      "Stone sculpture, once a thriving local industry, has suffered due to vast economic challenges and declining tourism.",
      "\u201cThis will boost business. Buyers abroad will now see our work and buy directly from the artists,\u201d said sculptor Wallace Mkanka. His piece, depicting the blinded Black face, was selected as the best of 110 entries and will be one of four winning sculptures on display at Oxford.",
      "Zimbabwe, meaning \u201cHouse of Stone,\u201d derives its identity from the Great Zimbabwe ruins, a 1,800-acre Iron Age city built with precision-cut stones delicately stacked without mortar. It is a UNESCO World heritage site.",
      "The southern African country has long used stone sculpture as a form of storytelling to immortalize history. The craft survived close to a century of colonial rule that sought to erase local traditions, religion and art forms.",
      "It thrived internationally instead. Thousands of pieces were plundered from Africa. Some later became subjects of repatriation campaigns. Others became prized by tourists and collectors. A permanent collection of 20 Zimbabwean stone sculptures is displayed in a pedestrian tunnel at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, one of the world\u2019s busiest.",
      "At its peak following independence, Zimbabwe\u2019s stone sculpture industry thrived, with local white farmers purchasing pieces for their homes and facilitating international sales.",
      "\u201cCustomers were everywhere. They would pay up front, and I always had a queue of clients,\u201d recalled Tafadzwa Tandi, a 45-year-old sculptor whose work will feature in the Oxford exhibition.",
      "However, the industry has struggled over the past two decades.",
      "Zimbabwe\u2019s global image suffered after controversial land reforms more than two decades ago displaced over 4,000 white farmers to redistribute land to about 300,000 Black families, according to government figures. Late ruler Robert Mugabe defended the reforms as necessary to address colonial-era inequities, but they had unintended economic consequences.",
      "\u201cMany of our customers were friends of the farmers. That is where the problem originated from,\u201d said Tendai Gwaravaza, chairman of Chitungwiza Arts Center.",
      "At the center, the sound of grinders filled the air as sculptors carved. Hundreds of finished pieces, ranging from small carvings to life-sized sculptures, waited for buyers.",
      "\u201cThe only solution now is to get out there to the markets ourselves. If we don\u2019t, no one will,\u201d Gwaravaza said.",
      "The Oxford exhibition represents such an opportunity for exposure, he said.",
      "It is the brainchild of the Oxford Zimbabwe Arts Partnership, formed in response to the \u201cRhodes Must Fall\u201d campaign during the Black Lives Matter protests in the U.S.",
      "The group, consisting of Zimbabwean artists, an Oxford alumnus and a professor of African history, initially envisioned a larger project titled \u201cOxford and Rhodes: Past, Present, and Future.\u201d It included enclosing Rhodes\u2019 statue in glass, installing 100 life-size bronze statues of African liberation fighters and creating a collaborative sculpture using recycled materials to represent the future.",
      "However, the project required an estimated 200,000 pounds, far beyond available resources. Eventually, Oriel College provided 10,000 pounds for a scaled-down exhibition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still my hope that one day it could happen, but for now we have just accepted something very small to make a start and to do something,\u201d said Richard Pantlin, the Oxford alumnus and OZAP co-founder.",

      "Trans groups are worried that Wednesday's landmark decision would undermine their rights, even though the U.K.'s highest court said transgender people remain protected from discrimination. The head of Equality and Human Rights Commission said the ruling will mean transgender women will be excluded from women\u2019s toilets, hospital wards and sports teams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying time to have your rights taken away from you,\" said 19-year-old transgender woman Sophie Gibbs. \u201cI was disappointed to think that we could live in a society that seems so progressive now but is willing to make such a dangerous and harmful ruling.\u201d",

      "The Supreme Court said that using a certificate to interpret someone\u2019s sex would clash with definitions of man and woman and, therefore, the anti-discrimination provisions of the 2010 Equality Act could \u201conly be interpreted as referring to biological sex.\u201d",

      "Tunisian media say a court has sentenced leading opposition figures to between 13 and 66 years in prison",
      "TUNIS, Tunisia -- A court in Tunisia has sentenced leading opposition figures to between 13 and 66 years in prison in the climax of a major trial accusing 40 people of conspiring against state security, according to Tunisian media reports.",
      "Activists called the case baseless and politically motivated. Tunisian President Kais Saied has rolled back many freedoms the North African country gained after spawning the Arab Spring pro-democracy uprisings in 2011.",
      "Those accused in the trial include former diplomats, business leaders, journalists, lawyers and human rights defenders, and some have spent more than two years in pre-trial detention. Others have fled abroad.",
      "The trial began in March and wrapped up late Friday and early Saturday with the court handing down sentences of between 13 and 66 years to prominent opposition leaders, according to official news agency TAP and local radio Jawahra FM.",
      "TAP quoted a substitute prosecutor as saying they were found guilty of conspiracy against state security and belonging to a terror group. The trial was held in a special criminal court for terrorism cases.",
      "Lawyers in the huge and high-profile case told Tunisian media that it was unclear how many of the 40 defendants were given prison terms.",
      "Former Tunisian legislator Said Ferjani was convicted to 13 years in prison, his daughter Kaouther Ferjani posted on X. Describing it as \u201cyet another fabricated conspiracy case,\u201d she said that other figures from Islamist party Ennahdha were also among those sentenced.",
      "Tunisia\u2019s president, re-elected for a second term last year, says the defendants are \u201ctraitors and terrorists\u201d because they accuse him of staging a coup in 2021.",
      "Several critics, including the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, have accused Saied\u2019s government of using the judiciary to stifle dissent since 2021, when he dissolved parliament and expanded executive authority.",
      "Human Rights Watch released a report this week outlining how Tunisia has expanded the use of politically motivated arrests and prosecutions to intimidate and silence critics. It said authorities in recent years have targeted lawyers, judges, journalists and activists in a crackdown on Saied's critics.",

      "The flame is passed from one candle to the next, the light overcoming the darkness in the rotunda. The flame is later transferred to Orthodox communities in other countries on special flights.",
      "Eastern Orthodox Christians believe the light miraculously appears inside the Holy Edicule, built on the traditional site of Jesus\u2019 tomb, while skeptics going back to the Middle Ages have dismissed it as a carnival trick for the masses.",
      "Either way, the ceremony, which goes back at least 1,200 years, is a sight to behold.",
      "It has also ignited safety concerns. In 1834 a frenzied stampede broke out in the darkened church, and the ruler of the Holy Land at the time barely escaped after his guards drew swords and hacked their way through the crowd, the historian Simon Sebag Montefiore recounts in his history of Jerusalem. Some 400 pilgrims died in the melee, most from suffocation or trampling.",
      "Israeli authorities have sought to limit participants in recent years, citing safety concerns. That has drawn protests from church leaders, who have accused it of upsetting the delicate, unwritten arrangements around Jerusalem's holy sites known as the status quo.",
      "On Saturday, there was a heavy military presence as thousands of worshipers passed through Israeli checkpoints to enter. AP reporters saw police detain one man, while scuffles occurred between police and some women who were barred from entering the courtyard.",

      "The Old City has a long history of tensions between Israelis and Palestinians, among different religious groups that share its hilly confines and even within certain faiths. Perceived infringements on the status quo in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher have sparked brawls between monks of different denominations.",
      "Israel says it is committed to ensuring freedom of worship for Jews, Christians and Muslims, and has long presented itself as an island of tolerance in the Middle East.",
      "In recent years, however, tensions have risen with the local Christian community, most of whom are Palestinian Christians, a population that has dwindled through decades of conflict as many have sought economic opportunities abroad.",

      "BANGKOK -- Basic services have yet to be restored to the areas of Myanmar worst hit by a huge earthquake three weeks ago, and emergency workers recovering bodies and clearing debris are contending with regular aftershocks and lack of resources, humanitarian services say.",
      "A situation report issued late Friday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said frequent strong aftershocks continue to shake central Myanmar almost daily, increasing fear and uncertainty among affected residents, disrupting response effort s and exacerbating the pressure on already limited resources and services.",
      "\u201cThree weeks after catastrophic twin earthquakes hit Myanmar on 28 March, the worst-affected communities are still without safe shelter, clean water and sanitation, stable electricity, health care and essential services,\u201d the report said.",
      "The epicenter of the 7.7 magnitude quake was near Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, but it hit a wide swath of the country, causing significant damage to six regions and states including the capital, Naypyitaw.",
      "It also worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis triggered by the country\u2019s civil war that had internally displaced more than 3 million people and left nearly 20 million in need, according to the United Nations.",
      "A report in the state-run Myanma Alinn newspaper published on Saturday said the quake's death toll had reached 3,726, with 5,105 people injured and 129 still missing. It said 1,975 international rescuers and medical workers from 25 countries had collaborated with local rescuers in saving 653 people and recovering 753 bodies from under rubble.",
      "Myanma Alinn said 65,096 houses and buildings, 2,514 schools, 4,317 Buddhist monasterial living quarters, 6,027 pagodas and temples, 350 hospitals and clinics, 170 bridges, 586 dams and 203 sections of the country\u2019s main highway were damaged by the earthquake.",
      "Myanmar Fire Services Department, an official emergency services agency operating in many areas of the country, said in statements posted Friday on its Facebook page that rescue workers were carrying out relief, search and cleaning debris from the big buildings, and had returned valuable jewelry, cash, and documents found among the rubble to their owners.",
      "It also said that rescuers recovered two bodies from collapsed buildings in Mandalay.",
      "An official from Myanmar Rescue Federation (Mandalay), which has been operating along with the firefighters, told The Associated Press on Friday that the priority three weeks on from the earthquake was to clear bodies and debris from under bigger buildings, while also providing assistance to the survivors affected by the earthquake.",
      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears arrest for speaking without authorization, said the number of bodies recovered daily has decreased to only one or two.",
      "Another emergency services worker in Mandalay, similarly speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of rescue teams operating in Mandalay has been steadily decreasing as most of the international rescue teams had returned to their countries after their work to find survivors was considered completed. He said local rescue workers were mainly participating in clearing debris and providing assistance.",
      "The United Nations Development Program earlier this month estimated that at least 2.5 million tons, or roughly 125,000 truckloads, of debris from the quake needs to be removed. It based its estimate on remote sensing analysis of images obtained by satellites.",
      "UN-Habitat, the U.N. agency for human settlements, said in a statement on Friday that its staff and the Myanmar Engineering Society were collaborating in assessing widespread building damage in earthquake-affected regions.",
      "In Naypyitaw, almost all rescuers have ceased their relief efforts, while government buildings that were damaged by the earthquake have not yet been repaired and remain in their post-earthquake condition, said a resident who asked not to be named for security reasons. In residential areas, people have almost completed clearing the debris on their own.",
      "Saturday's report in Myanma Alinn said Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, head of the military government, told his Cabinet members during a meeting on Friday that the urban layout of Naypyitaw will be redesigned.",
      "Naypyitaw became Myanmar\u2019s capital in 2006 after being built at great expense almost from scratch next to what had once been a logging center inhabited by largely by farmers. It is notable for its grandiose government buildings and under-utilized multi-lane roads.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- U.S. Vice President JD Vance is meeting with the Vatican No. 2 official, following a remarkable papal rebuke of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on migrants and Vance\u2019s theological justification of it.",
      "Vance, a Catholic convert, was due to meet Saturday with the Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin. There was speculation he might also briefly greet Pope Francis, who has begun resuming some official duties during his recovery from pneumonia.",
      "Vance was spending Easter weekend in Rome with his family and attended Good Friday services in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica on Friday after meeting with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni.",
      "Francis and Vance have tangled sharply over migration and the Trump administration\u2019s plans to deport migrants en masse. Francis has made caring for migrants a hallmark of his papacy and his progressive views on social justice issues have often put him at odds with members of the more conservative U.S. Catholic Church.",
      "Vance, who converted in 2019, identifies with a small Catholic intellectual movement, viewed by some critics as having reactionary or authoritarian leanings, that is often called \u201cpostliberal.\u201d",
      "Postliberals share some longstanding Catholic conservative views, such as opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. They envision a counterrevolution in which they take over government bureaucracy and institutions like universities from within, replacing entrenched \u201celites\u201d with their own and acting upon their vision of the \u201ccommon good.\u201d",
      "Just days before he was hospitalized in February, Francis blasted the Trump administration\u2019s deportation plans, warning that they would deprive migrants of their inherent dignity. In a letter to U.S. bishops, Francis also appeared to respond to Vance directly for having claimed that Catholic doctrine justified such policies.",
      "Vance had defended the administration\u2019s America-first crackdown by citing a concept from medieval Catholic theology known in Latin as \u201cordo amoris.\u201d He has said the concept delineates a hierarchy of care \u2014 to family first, followed by neighbor, community, fellow citizens and lastly those elsewhere.",
      "In his Feb. 10 letter, Francis appeared to correct Vance\u2019s understanding of the concept.",
      "\u201cChristian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extends to other persons and groups,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the \u2018Good Samaritan,\u2019 that is, by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\u201d",
      "Vance has acknowledged Francis\u2019 criticism but has said he would continue to defend his views. During a Feb. 28 appearance at the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, Vance didn\u2019t address the issue specifically but called himself a \u201cbaby Catholic\u201d and acknowledged there are \u201cthings about the faith that I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "While he had criticized Francis on social media in the past, recently he has posted prayers for Francis\u2019 recovery.",
      "On Friday, Vance, his wife and three young children had front-row seats at the Vatican\u2019s Good Friday service in St. Peter\u2019s, a two-hour solemn commemoration featuring Latin and Italian readings. Francis did not attend.",
      "But the pope has begun receiving visitors, including King Charles III, and this week ventured out of the Vatican to meet with prisoners at Rome's central jail to keep a Holy Thursday appointment ministering to the most marginalized.",
      "He has named other cardinals to preside over Easter services this weekend, but officials haven't ruled out a possible brief greeting with Vance.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m grateful every day for this job, but particularly today where my official duties have brought me to Rome on Good Friday,\u201d Vance posted on X. \u201cI wish all Christians all over the world, but particularly those back home in the US, a blessed Good Friday.\u201d",

      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania's presidential election redo next month will be a high-stakes test for the European Union member\u2019s democracy after last year\u2019s annulled vote triggered the country\u2019s deepest political crisis since 1989.",
      "Romania\u2019s Constitutional Court annulled the election on Dec. 6 after the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped first-round polls. The decision followed allegations of electoral violations and a Russian campaign promoting Georgescu, who is now under investigation and barred from the rerun. Moscow has denied it meddled.",
      "\u201cWhat happened last year was very serious and ... at that time, completely anti-democratic,\u201d Elena Lasconi, who came second to enter the runoff last year and is participating in the new election, told The Associated Press. \u201cIt was not justified, in my opinion.\u201d",
      "Once a communist state until the end of the Cold War, Romania has spent decades trying to build strong democratic institutions. But last year\u2019s annulled election shattered public trust \u2014 and it could take years to repair the damage.",
      "\u201cI think the public trust in political parties, in public institutions, in the state generally was quite low,\u201d says Septimius Parvu, coordinator of the electoral program at Expert Forum, a pro-democracy think-tank. \u201cThis dislocated even more the trust. It created an earthquake which would \u2026 leave marks in the longer term on the trust in democracy.\u201d",
      "Many feel Romanian authorities have not sufficiently explained what happened last year, which has left voters to wonder \"whether this will be the final election,\u201d Parvu added.",
      "Complicating Lasconi's chances in the rerun, her Save Romania Union party, or USR, withdrew its support for her last week in favor of incumbent Bucharest mayor Nicusor Dan, claiming he has a stronger chance of winning the presidency. Lasconi labeled colleagues who moved against her as \u201ccoup plotters.\"",
      "She said it adds to the chaos in the wake of last year\u2019s election debacle, which has already left many Romanians disillusioned. \u201cNone of the state institutions have assured us that we\u2019ll have fair elections,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople said in the streets, \u2018our votes don\u2019t count\u2019.\u201d",
      "Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, says there is an \u201cunderlying social discontent that could explode again\u201d unless political parties and candidates start to \"speak to all segments of society.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe underlying issue in Romania is the widespread public dissatisfaction with the political class,\" he said. \"It\u2019s important to keep reminding the public of what happened: that we were facing a campaign that attempted to hijack Romania\u2019s democracy using unorthodox and illegal means.\u201d",
      "Georgescu\u2019s stunning rise \u2014 from polling in single digits to leading the first round \u2014 shocked many observers. The Russia-friendly candidate, who has praised fascist figures from Romania\u2019s past, not only unnerved Brussels but raised urgent questions about foreign interference in European elections.",
      "Like other EU countries, the far-right vote in recent years has grown in Romania, fueled by widespread anti-establishment sentiment. After Georgescu was barred from the redo, Romania\u2019s far-right, which holds about a third of legislative seats, scrambled to find a successor.",
      "Up stepped George Simion, the leader of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, who came fourth in last year\u2019s race and later backed Georgescu. The second biggest party in the legislature, AUR, proclaims to stand for \u201cfamily, nation, faith, and freedom.\u201d",
      "Simion has drawn criticism in the past due to anti-EU rhetoric and remarks against continued aid to Ukraine, a neighboring country, which like Moldova, he is banned from entering over security concerns.",
      "Romania\u2019s decision to annul the election, and the ban on Georgescu\u2019s candidacy, has been strongly criticized by U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Elon Musk and Moscow \u2014 which publicly supported his candidacy in the rerun.",
      "\u201cGeopolitically, we are in a very complicated situation,\u201d Lasconi warned.",
      "Eleven candidates are participating in the first round, which is scheduled for May 4. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will be held on May 18.",
      "Other key candidates include Dan, the Bucharest mayor running independently under the campaign slogan \u201cHonest Romania,\u201d and Crin Antonescu, who is backed by Romania\u2019s governing coalition and is running on a \u201cRomania forward\u201d platform.",
      "Victor Ponta, a former prime minister between 2012 and 2015 who resigned after a fatal nightclub fire, is running on a MAGA-style \u201cRomania First\u201d ticket and boasts of having close ties to the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "After last year's events, data from local surveys should be taken with caution, given concerns about politicization. Still, a median of polls suggests a runoff could pit the far-right Simion against either Dan, Ponta, or Antonescu.",
      "A Simion presidency could threaten EU unity as the war rages on in neighboring Ukraine. This is compounded by Trump's attempts to forge closer ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin as he seeks an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "In the wake of the annulled election, the role social media allegedly played in Georgescu\u2019s success came under intense scrutiny when declassified Romanian intelligence pointed to coordinated foreign interference via the Chinese-owned video-sharing platform TikTok.",
      "The case highlighted the threat large social media platforms can pose to liberal democracies, and the EU Commission responded by launching an ongoing probe into TikTok to determine whether it violated the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act in failing to deal with risks to Romania's election.",
      "TikTok said it dismantled covert influence networks targeting Romanians in December, including over 27,000 accounts, which posted comments en masse via a \u201cfake engagement vendor\u201d promoting the AUR party and Georgescu, \"in an attempt to manipulate Romanian elections discourse.\" It also removed more than 1,100 accounts impersonating presidential candidates.",
      "TikTok stated it has taken steps to protect Romania\u2019s election integrity, including expanding its team of Romanian-speaking content moderators, working with a local fact-checking group to combat disinformation, and in-app tools linking to official election information.",
      "The concerns over social media, however, have led to what some critics view as undemocratic overreach by Romania\u2019s Central Election Bureau ahead of the new vote. The bureau has drawn recent criticism for requesting takedowns of online political comments by private citizens.",
      "The political turbulence sparked large street protests and has left many voters uncertain and divided.",
      "\u201cSociety is a bit divided, it\u2019s fragmented in a way as a reaction,\u201d said Octavian Frecea, a voter in Bucharest. \u201cOnly an isolated society isn\u2019t influenced from the outside \u2026 We are economically and politically dependent on everyone.\u201d",
      "As Romania heads into one of its most critical elections since 1989, the stakes go beyond who wins the next five-year presidency and may be viewed as a referendum on democracy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been divided for over 35 years,\u201d Lasconi said. \u201cNow Romania isn\u2019t just split in two \u2014 Romania is shattered into many pieces.\u201d",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran and the United States will hold talks Saturday in Rome, their second round of negotiations over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "The talks follow a first round held in Muscat, Oman, where the two sides spoke face to face.",
      "Trump has imposed new sanctions on Iran as part of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign targeting the country. He has repeatedly suggested military action against Iran remained a possibility, while emphasizing he still believed a new deal could be reached by writing a letter to Iran\u2019s 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to jump start these talks.",
      "Khamenei has warned Iran would respond to any attack with an attack of its own.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the letter, Iran\u2019s nuclear program and the tensions that have stalked relations between Tehran and Washington since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Trump dispatched the letter to Khamenei on March 5, then gave a television interview the next day in which he acknowledged sending it. He said: \u201cI\u2019ve written them a letter saying, \u2018I hope you\u2019re going to negotiate because if we have to go in militarily, it\u2019s going to be a terrible thing.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House, the president has been pushing for talks while ratcheting up sanctions and suggesting a military strike by Israel or the U.S. could target Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "A previous letter from Trump during his first term drew an angry retort from the supreme leader.",
      "But Trump\u2019s letters to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in his first term led to face-to-face meetings, though no deals to limit Pyongyang\u2019s atomic bombs and a missile program capable of reaching the continental U.S.",
      "Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, hosted the first round of talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff last weekend. The two men met face to face after indirect talks and immediately agreed to this second round.",
      "Witkoff later made a television appearance in which he suggested 3.67% enrichment for Iran could be something the countries could agree on. But that\u2019s exactly the terms set by the 2015 nuclear deal struck under U.S. President Barack Obama, from which Trump unilaterally withdrew America.",
      "Witkoff hours later issued a statement underlining something: \u201cA deal with Iran will only be completed if it is a Trump deal.\u201d Araghchi and Iranian officials have latched onto Witkoff\u2019s comments in recent days as a sign that America was sending it mixed signals about the negotiations.",
      "Iran has insisted for decades that its nuclear program is peaceful. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Iran now enriches uranium to near weapons-grade levels of 60%, the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program to do so.",
      "Under the original 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium up to 3.67% purity and to maintain a uranium stockpile of 300 kilograms (661 pounds). The last report by the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran\u2019s program put its stockpile at 8,294.4 kilograms (18,286 pounds) as it enriches a fraction of it to 60% purity.",
      "U.S. intelligence agencies assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program, but has \u201cundertaken activities that better position it to produce a nuclear device, if it chooses to do so.\u201d",
      "Ali Larijani, an adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, has warned in a televised interview that his country has the capability to build nuclear weapons, but it is not pursuing it and has no problem with the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s inspections. However, he said if the U.S. or Israel were to attack Iran over the issue, the country would have no choice but to move toward nuclear weapon development.",
      "\u201cIf you make a mistake regarding Iran\u2019s nuclear issue, you will force Iran to take that path, because it must defend itself,\u201d he said.",
      "Iran was once one of the U.S.\u2019s top allies in the Mideast under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who purchased American military weapons and allowed CIA technicians to run secret listening posts monitoring the neighboring Soviet Union. The CIA had fomented a 1953 coup that cemented the shah\u2019s rule.",
      "But in January 1979, the shah, fatally ill with cancer, fled Iran as mass demonstrations swelled against his rule. The Islamic Revolution followed, led by Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, and created Iran\u2019s theocratic government.",
      "Later that year, university students overran the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, seeking the shah\u2019s extradition and sparking the 444-day hostage crisis that saw diplomatic relations between Iran and the U.S. severed. The Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s saw the U.S. back Saddam Hussein. The \u201cTanker War\u201d during that conflict saw the U.S. launch a one-day assault that crippled Iran at sea, while the U.S. later shot down an Iranian commercial airliner that the American military said it mistook for a warplane.",
      "Iran and the U.S. have see-sawed between enmity and grudging diplomacy in the years since, with relations peaking when Tehran made the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. But Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord, sparking tensions in the Mideast that persist today.",

    "story": [
      "Eastern and Western churches will celebrate Easter on the same day this year, while marking 1,700 years since the Council of Nicaea unified Christian doctrine",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- For more than 400 years, Catholic and Orthodox churches have used different ways to determine the date of Easter. But this Sunday will mark a special moment for Christians, as the churches celebrate of Jesus\u2019 resurrection on the same day.",
      "What\u2019s more, top religious leaders \u2014 including Pope Francis \u2014 are expressing a desire to keep it that way. But the unusual alignment has stirred underlying mistrust between the two major Christian communions.",
      "The movable date for Easter follows a seemingly straightforward rule: the Sunday following the first full moon on or after the spring equinox. But the two churches started using different calendars after Pope Gregory XIII\u2019s adaptation in 1582, when the Western church adopted the Gregorian calendar while the Eastern Orthodox Church kept the older Julian one.",
      "Moreover, each church uses its own ecclesiastical calculations for lunar cycles and the equinox, which don\u2019t neatly match scientific projections.",
      "The result is that Easter dates can be as much as five weeks apart. They can coincide in back-to-back years, or a decade can pass without it happening.",
      "Days before his five-week hospitalization, Pope Francis referred to this year\u2019s Easter celebration while invoking the 1,700th anniversary of the historic Council of Nicaea, when Christian leaders gathered to settle foundational disputes about the faith.",
      "\"Once again, I renew my appeal: Let this coincidence serve as a sign \u2014 a call to all Christians to take a decisive step toward unity around a common date for Easter,\u201d Francis said while leading prayers at the Basilica of St. Paul in Rome.",
      "Francis\u2019 invitation, delivered at the end of a prayer for Christian Unity with Orthodox priests present, wasn\u2019t new. Returning from a trip to Turkey in 2014, he told reporters on the plane that a unified date would be logical.",
      "\u201cIt is a bit ridiculous,\u201d he said, then staged a pretend conversation: \u201c\u2018Tell me, your Christ, when is he resurrected? Next week? Mine was resurrected last week.\u2019\u201d",
      "He has found an ally in Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, a fellow octogenarian and spiritual leader of the world\u2019s Orthodox Christians. The two \u201cspeak to one another like brothers,\u201d Francis has said. For his part, Bartholomew has called Francis \u201cour elder brother\u201d and described the Easter initiative as \u201ca real step toward repairing old conflicts.\u201d",
      "The idea of a common Easter has been discussed since the 1960s, with interest often peaking when celebrations coincide. The key obstacle has always been the implication that one side would need to concede.",
      "Protestants, who follow the same calendar as Catholics, have also been in on the discussions.",
      "The Geneva-based World Council of Churches \u2014 a fellowship of Orthodox and Protestant bodies \u2014 has proposed a compromise. It suggests using modern astronomy, basing the calculation on Jerusalem time and following the same basic rule set centuries ago.",
      "\u201cIt has never been more important than now, because we live in a polarized world and people all over the world yearn for more unity,\u201d Lutheran Bishop Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, a senior WCC official, told The Associated Press from his home outside Berlin. \u201cAll other questions \u2013 on calendar, on time, on the moon and the stars and everything \u2013 it\u2019s not primary; it\u2019s secondary.\"",
      "While the pope\u2019s wishes may carry powerful influence through the Vatican\u2019s highly centralized authority, Bartholomew\u2019s role is largely symbolic over the self-governed national and local churches. And discussions between Russia, the Orthodox world\u2019s most populous country, and churches of other Orthodox-majority countries remain stalled due to the war and church divisions in Ukraine.",
      "Further complicating prospects for consensus is a history characterized by centuries of mistrust, largely driven by wariness in the East about the Vatican\u2019s supremacy.",
      "At a Holy Week service Monday in Athens, Father Anastasios welcomed parishioners into the Church of Saint Dimitrios Loumbardiaris, a restored stone chapel near the Acropolis. He said he supports forging bonds with Christianity's other branches \u2014 but with caution.",
      "\u201cWe can try to build bridges, but we cannot distort our faith or the traditions of our ancestors, or the dogmas Christ himself handed down,\" he said. \"There are deeply rooted differences. From my view and that of many people here, the unity sought in the past by the Roman Catholic Church often wasn\u2019t sincere; it came with strings attached, was more about dominance than genuine reconciliation.\u201d",
      "As dialogue between the churches slowly unfolds, common Easter celebrations are already a practical reality in a few places. The Orthodox Church in Finland switched dates in the 1920s to align celebrations with the Lutheran majority. And Catholics in Greece \u2014 while making no official change to their calendar \u2014 have celebrated with the rest of the country since 1970.",
      "Joseph Roussos, a member of a Catholic community on the Greek island of Syros, took his first trip to the Vatican last month.",
      "At age 67, he remembers when Easters in Greece were separate: when schools and shopkeepers on the island closed for different holidays, and the church bells tolled mournfully during two distinct Holy Weeks.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a good situation. But when we did celebrate Easter together, there was great harmony,\u201d he said. \u201cWe live very well (today), and it\u2019s truly beautiful. I hope it stays that way.\u201d",

      "A group of human rights lawyers is suing Costa Rica, alleging the Central American nation violated the rights of dozens of migrant children",
      "MEXICO CITY -- A group of human rights lawyers is suing Costa Rica, alleging the Central American nation violated the rights of dozens of migrant children by detaining them in a rural camp for nearly two months after they were deported from the U.S. in February.",
      "The children, some as young as 2, are part of a group of hundreds of migrants from mostly Asian countries \u2014 Afghanistan, China, Russia and others \u2014 who were deported from the U.S. as part of a wider effort by the Trump administration to ramp up deportations.",
      "Many had hoped to seek asylum in the U.S. and expressed fear over returning to their own countries. Instead, they were dropped in Costa Rica and Panama, where they don't speak the local language. The countries were originally intended as a kind of deportation layover, but the migrants have now spent 50 days in limbo.",
      "Critics described it as a way for the U.S. to export its deportation process, while human rights groups have warned that the two countries were turning into a \u201cblack hole\u201d for deportees.",
      "In Costa Rica, around 200 migrants, 81 of them children, were driven out to a rural migrant processing center along the Costa Rica-Panama border and detained in a former factory building.",
      "The lawsuit from the Global Strategic Litigation Council and other human right groups was filed before the U.N. committee that monitors the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child on Thursday night, and alleges that Costa Rica violated the convention.",
      "Silvia Serna Roman, one of the attorneys filing the suit, said the migrants were held in detention without legal status, with no access to educational services or mental health services in their native language. It has fueled concern the long-term impacts that extended detention could have on the children as many parents have reported their children appearing isolated or sad.",
      "\u201cThe kids are in a very crucial part of their development, and they are all fleeing complicated contexts in their countries. And now they\u2019re subjected to detention for different, but long periods of time and inhumane treatment,\u201d Serna Roman said Friday. \u201cThe parents are concerned.\u201d",
      "Serna Roman said migrants have had little access to legal counsel. The Costa Rican government has said migrants could leave the detention facility if they agree to return to their countries of origin or seek asylum in Costa Rica.",
      "But the lawyer said many families fear they would have nowhere to go and potentially end up on the street, so they've remained in \u201cindefinite detention\" in the facility known as CATEM.",
      "\u201cMany people are afraid to leave CATEM because at least it means shelter, means three meals a day, means a roof over their heads,\" Serna Roman said. \u201cThe Costa Rican government hasn\u2019t been upfront about how they plan to further protect these people.\"",
      "The Associated Press has repeatedly been denied access to the detention facility since the migrants arrived, but when journalists visited the camp in 2023, families were sleeping on cardboard or in tents on the ground where some say liquid from portable toilets leaks with sparse food.",
      "Costa Rican officials have disputed reports by the country\u2019s Ombudsman\u2019s Office that the deportees arrived in Costa Rica in visible distress and that authorities failed to guarantee proper conditions for arriving deportees.",
      "Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves said in February that in accepting the Asian migrants, his country was \u201chelping the economically powerful brother to the north.\u201d",
      "The suit by GSLC and local human rights groups is just the latest in a number of legal fights that have popped up surrounding deportees sent to Central American countries. The same group of lawyers filed a similar case against Panama, which was holding migrants in hotels and in remote camps near the Darien Gap, where deportees said they were stripped of their phones. Sharp criticisms prompted the Panamanian government to release the migrants on the streets of Panama City last month, leaving many migrants to fend for themselves.",
      "Most recently, the deportation of groups of Venezuelan migrants and an American citizen to El Salvador, where they have been held in a high security prison for gangs, with little evidence to support alleged gang affiliations has also fueled legal battles and fierce political fights.",

      "PARIS -- Four months after its long-awaited reopening, Notre Dame Cathedral welcomed worshippers and tourists alike on Friday for an emotional Easter ceremony centered on the Crown of Thorns, a circular band of branches encased in a golden tube and one of Christianity\u2019s most revered relics.",
      "The ritual, held during Holy Week, included liturgical chants, candlelight, and a solemn procession of clerics carrying the Crown of Thorns through the alleys of the cathedral.",
      "Tourists queued in a line that stretched across the Seine, waiting to enter the renovated Gothic landmark. Inside, ushers struggled to gently enforce a separation between curious visitors and the faithful.",
      "Notre Dame\u2019s rector, Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, said this week\u2019s crowda exceeded expectations.",
      "\u201c Before the fire, we saw about 20,000 pilgrims a day,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s closer to 30,000. The joy people feel rediscovering the cathedral \u2014 you can see it on their faces as they leave.\u201d",

But our goal isn\u2019t to set records. What matters is seeing the cathedral come back to life.\u201d",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Drew Greenblatt is fully on board with the Trump administration\u2019s use of tariffs to rebalance a global trading system that it says favors foreign companies over U.S. manufacturers.",
      "Greenblatt is the president and owner of Marlin Steel Wire Products in Baltimore, Maryland, which makes baskets and racks for medical device manufacturers, aerospace companies, food processing companies and others. It has 115 employees and makes its products in three locations in Maryland, Indiana and Michigan. The steel is sourced from Tennessee, Illinois and Michigan.",
      "Currently, it\u2019s hard to compete with baskets made overseas., Greenblatt says, because the countries he competes against have an \u201cunfair advantage.\u201d For example, due to European tariffs and taxes, it costs much more for a German consumer or company to buy Marlin wire baskets than it does for Americans to buy a German-made basket, creating an uneven playing field, Greenblatt said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wildly unfair to the American worker,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this has, by the way, been going on for decades.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has called U.S. manufacturing an \u201ceconomic and national security\u201d priority. U.S. manufacturing has been declining for decades. In June 1979, the number of manufacturing workers peaked at 19.6 million. By January of 2025, employment was down 35% to 12.8 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Small manufacturers, which make up 99% of all American manufacturing, have been hit particularly hard.",
      "The administration has implemented some tariffs against major U.S. trading partners, while putting a hold on other tariffs pending negotiations. The Trump administration says tariffs will force companies to have more products made in the U.S. to avoid steep price increases on their imports, which will mean \u201cbetter-paying American jobs,\u201d for people making cars, appliances and other goods.",
      "Greenblatt agrees, saying he could double his staff if \u201cparity\u201d in tariffs becomes a reality.",
      "While other small manufacturing businesses also support the tariffs, other owners have concerns. The Trump tariffs threaten to upend the existing economic order and possibly push the global economy into recession. And the uneven rollout of the policy has created uncertainty for businesses, financial markets and U.S. households.",
      "For Corry Blanc, the injection of uncertainty around the economy outstrips any potential benefit.",
      "He started his business, Blanc Creatives in Waynesboro, Virginia, in 2012. He makes handcrafted cookware such as skillets and other kitchenware and bakeware with American steel and wood and employs 12 staffers. He gets his steel from a plant in South Carolina and a distributor in Richmond. Wood comes from local regional sawmills near the company\u2019s headquarters in Waynesboro, Virginia.",
      "He said he\u2019s been fielding worried calls from customers in Canada and overseas. And he says the infrastructure isn\u2019t in place to increase production if more people do start buying American-made goods.",
      "Blanc said he survived the pandemic and other tough times, but conditions now are the hardest they\u2019ve ever been.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much uncertainty and not a lot of direction,\u201d he said.",
      "Michael Lyons is the founder of Rogue Industries, a company that makes wallets and other leather goods in a workshop in Standish, Maine, with a staff of nine. He uses leather from Maine and the Midwest. About 80% of his products are made in Maine and 20% are imported.",
      "He said the uncertainty around the tariffs is outweighing any potential long-term benefit. A long-time customer from Canada recently told Lyons that he would no longer be buying from Rogue Industries because of the friction between the two countries.",
      "\u201cHopefully this will pass, and he\u2019ll be able to come back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I did think that was kind of an interesting indicator for him to reach out.\u201d",
      "Lyons would like to expand his business, but says, \u201cat the time being, it\u2019s probably going to be, we hold with what we have.\u201d",
      "American Giant CEO Bayard Winthrop takes a more positive view. He founded his clothing company in 2011 after watching the textile industry go offshore, and seeing a lack of quality, affordable American-made clothing. He started by selling one sweatshirt, and now sells a wider range of clothing, mostly direct-to-consumer, but he also has a contract with Walmart.",
      "He sources cotton from Southeastern states like Georgia, Florida and North Carolina and has a factory in North Carolina and a joint partnership facility in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cPeople forget that in about 1985 that all the clothing that Americans bought was made in America,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is only in the last 40 years that that we really pursued as a country a very aggressive approach to globalization.\u201d",
      "In 1991, more than half of U.S. apparel, about 56%, was made in the U.S., according to statistics from the American Apparel and Footwear Association. By 2023 that number had shrunk to less than 4%.",

      "Staff who handle incoming charges, or intakes, were directed to code them as \u201cC,\u201d the lowest categorization in the EEOC's system that is usually reserved for meritless charges, according to the agency employees who attended the Microsoft Teams meeting for intake supervisors, district directors and support staff that was led by the EEOC's national intake coordinator. The employees asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to reveal the meeting details.",
      "An EEOC spokesman declined to comment on the meeting, saying that \u201cper federal law, we cannot discuss investigatory practices.\u201d",
      "The decision is the latest step by the EEOC to back away from defending the rights of transgender and nonbinary workers in a major shift in civil rights enforcement under the Trump administration. In February, the EEOC moved to drop seven of its own pending lawsuits alleging discrimination against transgender and nonbinary people.",
      "EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, has said one of her priorities will be implementing Trump\u2019s executive order on gender and \u201cdefending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\u201d She had previously ordered that any worker discrimination charge that \u201cimplicates\u201d Trump\u2019s executive order on gender should be elevated to headquarters for review.",
      "This latest decision to bury gender identity-related complaints leaves transgender and nonbinary people experiencing discrimination at work with limited recourse. U.S. workers must file discrimination complaints through the EEOC in most cases before they can seek other legal avenues.",
      "Giving gender identity-related cases the lowest priority essentially pre-determines that they are meritless, said Chai Feldblum, who was an EEOC commissioner from 2010-2019.",
      "\u201cIf they say they are bringing it to a central location to give them due consideration, they at least have the facade of doing something,\u201d Feldblum said of Lucas\u2019 previous directive on gender identity cases. \u201cIf they are sweeping them out the door as \u201cC\u201d charges, they are not doing their job.\u201d",
      "The EEOC has said that it will still issue \u201cright to sue\u201d notices in gender-identity related cases upon request, meaning workers can decide to pursue a lawsuit on their own. The agency will also honor requests for mediation, according to the employees who attended Wednesday's meeting. But if mediation fails, the EEOC will take no further action on the case, the employees said.",
      "The EEOC\u2019s new approach to gender-identity related discrimination has raised a debate over whether the agency is acting in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County, a landmark case that established that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits workplace discrimination based on gender identity.",
      "Civil rights activists have accused the EEOC of illegally defying the Supreme Court and abdicating its duty to enforce anti-discrimination laws by abandoning gender-identity related lawsuits. Lucas has previously told The AP that the EEOC has a duty to comply with Trump\u2019s executive orders but she has not directly addressed the criticism that the agency\u2019s handling of gender-identity cases are in tension with the Supreme Court.",

      "Cambodia and China have signed a $1.2 billion deal to finance an ambitious canal project that aims to boost trade efficiency by linking a branch of the Mekong River near Phnom Penh to a port on the Gulf of Thailand",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Cambodia and China have signed a $1.2 billion deal to finance an ambitious canal project that aims to boost trade efficiency by linking a branch of the Mekong River near Phnom Penh to a port on the Gulf of Thailand, the Cambodian government agency heading the project announced Friday.",
      "The deal to fund the Funan Techo Canal was signed Thursday during the state visit to Cambodia of Chinese President Xi Jinping, the agency said in a news release. Xi returned home Friday after a three-nation Southeast Asian tour that also included Vietnam and Malaysia.",
      "Construction of the 151.6-kilometer (94-mile) canal began last year but was halted shortly after the Aug. 5 groundbreaking ceremony for reasons that were not made clear. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said at the time that the canal will be built \u201cno matter what the cost,\u201d emphasizing that the project promotes \u201cnational prestige, the territorial integrity and the development of Cambodia.\u201d",
      "Described as a public-private partnership contract, the deal was signed by Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol on behalf of Cambodia\u2019s government, and by Ieng Sunly of the Funan Techo Coastal-Inland Waterways Company Ltd., the private sector partner. The project is being developed on a build-operate-transfer basis, with Cambodian investors holding a 51% stake, and Chinese investors holding 49%.",
      "\u201cThe canal will create a new inland waterway-maritime corridor capable of handling vessels up to 3,000 deadweight tons,\u201d according to Friday\u2019s announcement. It will encompass canal excavation and the construction of ship locks, navigation and logistics infrastructure.",
      "\u201cAs an inland waterway and important transport infrastructure in Cambodia, the FTC Project will become a new engine driving national economic growth,\" said Wang Tongzhou, chairman of China Communications Construction Company, in the announcement. He added that \"after completion, it will significantly reduce the comprehensive logistics costs in Cambodia, and promote Cambodia\u2019s industry to the middle-to-high end of the value chain.\u201d",
      "China Communications Construction Company is the parent company of China Road and Bridge Corporation, the contractor for the project's construction from the Bassac River to the coastal province of Kep. The massive state-owned firm has faced scrutiny for its alleged involvement in financial scandals. It is also blacklisted by the United States for its role in helping the Chinese military construct and militarize artificial islands in the South China Sea.",
      "According to Friday's announcement, the canal is expected to create \"up to 50,000 direct and indirect jobs in Cambodia.\u201d",
      "Critics have raised concerns that the canal could severely disrupt the Mekong Rive r\u2019s natural flood patterns. These disruptions could lead to worsening droughts and a reduction in the nutrient-rich silt essential for Vietnam\u2019s vital rice production in the Mekong Delta, a region that sustains millions and is a major global rice exporter.",
      "The signing announcement, however, stated that \u201cA rigorous Environmental Impact Assessment, conducted by 48 specialists, confirmed minimal environmental impact.\u201d",
      "It added that the Cambodian government has led efforts to minimize resettlement \u201cwith a route designed to avoid dense communities and cultural sites\" and that \"a responsible compensation and consultation process is underway.\u201d",

      "Venice has started charging day-trippers to the famed canal city an arrivals tax for the second year, in a measure aimed at combating the kind of overtourism that put the city\u2019s UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status at risk",
      "VENICE, Italy -- Venice is charging day-trippers to the famed canal city an arrivals tax for the second year starting Friday, a measure aimed at combating the kind of overtourism that put the city's UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status at risk.",
      "A UNESCO body decided against putting Venice on its list of cultural heritage sites deemed in danger after the tax was announced. But opponents of the day-tripper fee say it has done nothing to discourage tourists from visiting Venice even on high-traffic days.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Venice\u2019s battle with overtourism by the numbers:",
      "The fee charged to visitors who are not overnighting in Venice to enter its historic center during the second year of the day-tripper tax. Visitors who download a QR code at least three days in advance will pay 5 euros ($5.69) \u2014 the same amount charged last year throughout the pilot program. But those who make last-minute plans pay double. The QR code is required from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is checked at entry points to the city, including the Santa Lucia train station, the Piazzale Roma bus depot and the Tronchetto parking garage.",
      "The number of days this year that day visitors to Venice will be charged a fee to enter the historic center. They include mostly weekends and holidays from April 18 to July 27. That is up from 29 last year. The new calendar covers entire weeks over key holidays and extends the weekend period to include Fridays.",
      "That is the amount Venice took in during a 2024 pilot program for the tax. The city's top budget official, Michele Zuin, said last year the running costs for the new system ran to 2.7 million euros, overshooting the total fees collected. This year, Zuin projects a surplus of about 1 million euros to 1.5 million euros, which will be used to offset the cost of trash collection and other services for residents.",
      "The number of day-trippers who paid the tax in 2024. Officials said that 12,744 day-trippers paid to enter the city on Friday \u2014 7,173 at the higher 10-euro rate. They were among the 77,000 who have registered so far to enter the city this year. Another 117,000 have registered for exemptions, which apply to anyone born in Venice, those paying property taxes in the city, studying or working in the historic center, or living in the wider Veneto region, among others.",
      "The average number of daily visitors on the first 11 days of 2024 that Venice charged day-trippers. That's about 10,000 people more than the number of tourists recorded on each of the three important holidays during the previous year. City council member Giovanni Andrea Martini, an opponent of the measure, said the figures show the project has not deterred visitors.",
      "The number of official residents in Venice\u2019s historic center composed of over 100 islands connected by footbridges and traversed by its famed canals. The population peaked at 174,000 in 1951, when Venice was home to thriving industries. The number shrank during Italy's postwar economic boom as residents moved to the mainland for more modern housing \u2014 including indoor plumbing which was lacking in Venice. It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose. Activists also blame the \u201cmono-culture\u201d of tourism, which they say has emptied the city of basic services like shops for everyday goods and medical care.",
      "The number of beds for tourists in Venice\u2019s historic center, including 12,627 in the less regulated short-term rental market, according to April data from the Ocio housing activist group. The number of tourist beds surpassed the number of permanent residents in 2023, according to Ocio's monitor. Anyone staying in a hotel within the city limits, including on the mainland districts of Mestre and Marghera, pays a lodging tax and is therefore exempt from the day-tripper tax.",
      "The number of annual arrivals of both day-trippers and overnight guests roughly confirmed by cellphone data tracked from a Smart Control Room since 2020, according to city officials.",

      "His arrival comes a day after the two countries held their first round of tariff talks between their top negotiators in Washington where both sides agreed to try to reach an agreement as quickly as possible and hold a second round of meetings later this month.",
      "Trump, alongside his top economic advisers Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, attended the meeting with the Japanese delegation headed by Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa at the White House.",
      "With his reputation as a dealmaker being tested, Trump likely wants to finalize a series of trade deals as countries around the world seek to curb damages from the U.S. tariffs.",

America\u2019s $40 trillion national debt, Glass said, makes the country \"unsustainable and that\u2019s the end of our economy if we keep going down this road.\"",
      "Glass did not elaborate on how he could help Tokyo and Washington hammer out their differences when he assumes his official duties on Monday. After a long flight, he said, \u201cwhat I'd like to do first is to go home and take a nap.\"",

      "Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels say U.S. airstrikes targeting oil port killed at least 74 people and injured at least 171 others",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- U.S. airstrikes targeting an oil port held by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels killed 74 people and wounded 171 others, the group said Friday, in the deadliest known attack under President Donald Trump\u2019s new military campaign against the Iranian-backed faction.",
      "The strike on the Ras Isa port, which sent massive fireballs shooting into the night sky, represented a major escalation in the American effort by hitting oil facilities for the first time.",
      "Assessing the toll of Trump\u2019s campaign, which began March 15, has been difficult, as the U.S. military's Central Command hasn't released any information, including its attacks' targets and how many people have been killed. The Houthis, meanwhile, strictly control access to attacked areas and don\u2019t publish complete information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.",
      "In a statement, Central Command said \u201cU.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully,\u201d it added. It did not acknowledge any casualties from the attack or offer any damage assessment.",
      "Hours after the strike, the Houthis launched a missile toward Israel that was intercepted, the Israeli military said. Sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and elsewhere.",
      "Yemen's civil war, meanwhile, further internationalized, as the U.S. alleged a Chinese satellite company was \u201cdirectly supporting\u201d Houthi attacks \u2014 a claim Beijing declined to directly comment on. And a second round of negotiations between Iran and the U.S. over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program, which America has linked to the Yemen campaign, is due to happen Saturday in Rome.",
      "The Ras Isa port, a collection of oil tanks and refining equipment, sits in Yemen's Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. It is just off Kamaran Island, which has been targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes over the past few days.",
      "The Houthis\u2019 al-Masirah satellite news channel aired graphic footage of the aftermath, showing corpses strewn across the site and smashed tanker trucks ablaze.",
      "Satellite images of the port from Planet Labs PBC and analyzed by The Associated Press showed destroyed oil tanks and vehicles. Oil also appeared to be leaking into the Red Sea. Wim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with Dutch peace organization PAX, said it appeared at least three fuel storage tanks had been destroyed and that oil had leaked from mooring pipelines.",
      "The port also is the terminus of an oil pipeline stretching to Yemen's energy-rich Marib governorate, which is held by allies of Yemen's exiled government. The Houthis expelled that government from Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014. However, oil exports have been halted by the decadelong war and the Houthis have used Ras Isa to bring in oil.",
      "Ras Isa takes in gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas for the Houthis. The damage from the airstrikes could seriously affect life in Houthi-held areas of Yemen.",
      "The Houthis denounced the U.S. attack as a \u201ccompletely unjustified aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades,\" the Houthis said in a statement.",
      "On April 9, the U.S. State Department issued a warning about oil shipments to Yemen, saying it would \u201cnot tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis.\u201d",
      "The attack follows Israeli airstrikes on the Houthis that hit port and oil infrastructure used by the rebels after their attacks on Israel, including Ras Isa.",
      "The airstrike on the port is the deadliest known attack yet in Trump's campaign against the Houthis. The actual cost in lives is hard to assess, said Luca Nevola, the senior analyst for Yemen and the Gulf at the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a think tank.",
      "\u201cSince they are targeting civilian areas, there\u2019s a lot more victims. But it\u2019s also difficult to assess how many because the Houthis are releasing these umbrella statements that cover all the victims ... or tend to stress only the civilian victims,\u201d Nevola said.",
      "Further complicating the situation is the U.S. strikes hitting military targets, said Mohammed al-Basha, a Yemen expert at the Basha Report risk advisory firm. He pointed to an American attack that Trump highlighted online with black-and-white strike footage, which might have killed about 70 fighters.",
      "\u201cAlthough the Houthis claimed it was a tribal gathering, they neither released any footage nor named a single casualty, strongly suggesting the victims were not civilians but affiliated fighters,\u201d al-Basha said. \u201cHowever, the overnight strike on the Ras Isa Fuel Port marks the first mass-casualty incident the Houthis have openly acknowledged and publicized.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a briefing with journalists accused Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., a commercial satellite image provider, of \u201cdirectly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Bruce did not elaborate in detail, but acknowledged a report by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the firm linked to the People\u2019s Liberation Army has provided images allowing the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.",
      "Bruce said \u201cBeijing's support ... of the satellite company\u201d \u201ccontradicts their claims of being peace supporters.\u201d",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, responding to a question about the allegation, said Friday: \u201cI am not familiar with the situation you mentioned.\" However, he insisted China is seen as urging countries \u201cto make more efforts conducive to regional peace and stability.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince the escalations in the Red Sea situation, China has been playing a positive role in de-escalating the situation,\u201d Lin said. \u201cWho is promoting talks for peace and de-escalating the tensions, and who is imposing sanctions and pressure?\u201d",
      "Chang Guang did not respond to request for comment. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned the company in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine.",
      "It remains unclear whether Chang Guang is linked to the Chinese government. The U.S. government in the past has used images taken by American commercial satellite companies to share with allies, like Ukraine, to avoid releasing its own top-secret pictures.",
      "An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than that under former President Joe Biden. The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships without success.",

      "The chairman and CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH has called for a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States, saying that unresolved trade tensions could seriously hurt European industries",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, called on Thursday for a free trade zone between the European Union and the United States and said that unresolved trade tensions could seriously hurt European industries.",
      "His remarks, in the wake of the tariffs announced by President Donald Trump, appeared to echo a similar call by Elon Musk on April 5 for a zero-tariff zone between the U.S. and EU. The EU has long pushed for a \u201czero-for-zero\u201d trade agreement \u2014 with both sides dropping tariffs \u2014 but Trump has rejected the offer.",
      "Speaking at LVMH\u2019s annual shareholder meeting, Arnault said European leaders should negotiate \u201ccleverly\u201d with the U.S. administration and that national governments should take a more prominent role instead of than leaving negotiations solely in the hands of Brussels, the center of EU\u2019s \u201cbureaucratic power.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s LVMH has for decades been the world\u2019s dominant luxury group \u2014 known for products such as Mo\u00ebt & Chandon Champagne, Hennessy Cognac, Louis Vuitton handbags and Dior perfumes \u2014 but this week lost its title as the world\u2019s largest luxury company to rival Herm\u00e8s.",
      "\u201cEurope is not run by a political power, but by a bureaucratic power that spends its time issuing regulations that are unfortunately imposed on all member states and that penalize our business sectors,\u201d the 76-year-old CEO said.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, negotiates trade deals on behalf of all 27 member states. The bloc is the largest trading entity in the world.",
      "LVMH shares fell 7.8% earlier this week, following an unexpected drop in first-quarter sales.",
      "Arnault said the company may be forced to expand U.S. operations. \"We would be forced to increase our American production to avoid tariffs if Europe failed to negotiate with intelligence,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2019, LVMH shifted part of its production to the U.S. by opening a Louis Vuitton workshop in Alvarado, Texas, during Trump\u2019s first term. Trump and Arnault toured the facility together, promoting it as a symbol of U.S. manufacturing revival.",
      "But on Thursday, Arnault admitted the Texas site has underperformed so far. According to documents presented at the meeting, the U.S. accounts for 25% of LVMH\u2019s total sales.",
      "Arnault also criticized France\u2019s proposed corporate tax increases, calling them a \u201ctax on \u2018Made in France\u2019\u201d and warned they could push companies to relocate abroad.",
      "He praised the U.S. model, citing lower taxes and state-backed industrial investment. \u201cWhen you come back to France after spending a few days in the U.S., it\u2019s a bit of a cold shower,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside the Louvre Museum conference hall, where the meeting took place, dozens of protesters demanded higher taxes on the wealthy, carrying a \u201cTax the rich\u201d sign alongside and a large puppet of Arnault depicted as a thief, a rope around his chest and hands tied behind his back.",
      "\u201cA tax of 2% on the wealth of France\u2019s ultra-rich could bring in up to \u20ac25 billion a year,\u201d said Fanny Petitbon, a spokesperson for the group 350.org. \u201cThat would be enough to invest in public services and accelerate an energy transition that benefits everyone.\u201d",

      "The world economy\u2019s resilience is being tested \u201cby the reboot of the global trading system\u201d that threatens to cause turbulence in financial markets, Georgieva said.",
      "That turbulence has been playing out in financial markets for weeks now, especially on Wall Street, which has experienced wild swings from day-to-day and often times even hour-to-hour.",
      "The IMF chief also echoed some Trump administration concerns. She called on countries to reduce their tariffs and lower other barriers to trade, a process that she said had stalled out in the past decade after making steady progress for many years after World War II.",
      "\u201cTrade distortions \u2014 tariff and nontariff barriers \u2014 have fed negative perceptions of a multilateral system seen to have failed to deliver a level playing field,\u201d she said. \u201cThis feeling of unfairness in some places feeds the narrative: we play by the rules while others game the system without penalty.\u201d",
      "Georgieva added that tariffs cause uncertainty, which can be costly. Due to the complexity of supply chains, the cost of a single item can be affected by tariffs in dozens of countries, she said.",
      "Increased trade barriers also tend to immediately impact growth, and while it can lead to more domestic production, that takes time to implement, she added.",
      "In its most recent projections issued in January, the IMF forecast the world economy to grow nominally faster and for inflation to come down, though it warned that outlook was clouded by President Donald Trump's policies, including tax cuts and increased tariffs on foreign imports.",
      "The Washington-based lending agency said at the time that it expected the world economy to grow 3.3% this year and next, up from 3.2% in 2024.",
      "Global inflation, which had surged after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted global supply chains and caused shortages and higher prices, was forecast to fall from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.2% this year and 3.5% in 2026.",
      "However, in a blog post that accompanied those projections, the fund\u2019s chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, wrote that the policies Trump has promised to introduce \u201care likely to push inflation higher in the near term.\u2019\u2019",
      "Those forecasts from January are expected to change \u2014 possibly significantly \u2014 as Trump's trade war has escalated in recent months, particularly with the U.S.'s biggest trade partner, China.",
      "Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats \u2014 leading to more volatility in the stock market \u2014 but has been in a tit-for-tat tariff battle with China and has shown no sign of backing down. Each time Trump has raised tariffs on China, Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China means hopeful solar buyers may have a much harder time getting systems installed in the U.S. in coming months",
      "Mike Summers was eager to install solar at his home in Ohio for years, and after he finally replaced his aging roof this year, his solar contractor swung into action. His system \u2014 including 19 panels and a battery backup \u2014 went up this week, and Summers considers himself lucky.",
      "\u201cI'm glad to have done it when I did,\u201d said Summers, a former mayor in his city of Lakewood just west of Cleveland. He'll get about $10,000 in tax credits on his $39,000 investment, but nearly as important is that all the equipment was readily available.",
      "Other hopeful solar buyers may have a much harder time in coming months. President Donald Trump's escalating trade war with China threatens to crimp a massive source of solar panels and parts, with experts saying the cost of projects will certainly rise as China retaliates.",
      "China accounted for at least 80% of the components of solar panels as recently as 2022, according to an International Energy Agency report, especially polysilicon, glass and solar cells. Solar also demands increasing critical mineral supplies, of which China is a key player across the globe, and electronics.",
      "In the U.S., private industry has poured $18.2 billion into developing a domestic supply chain in recent years, according to Atlas Public Policy, that includes everything from the ingots and wafers that make up panels to electrical and structural components to assembly of the panels themselves. Most of that came from the Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden's administration, with massive funding for clean energy investment.",
      "But that won\u2019t come close to replacing what China produces.",
      "\u201cReally everybody\u2019s losing when you think about it, because the systems are costing more for the customers and it\u2019s also just making it more difficult, in some ways, for us to do business,\u201d said Brian DiPaolo, assistant sales manager at Cleveland-based solar installer YellowLite, which is doing Summers\u2019 project. DiPaolo said some customers are holding off on plans until there is more clarity. The company still stocked up on solar panels, made in North America, a month ago to stay competitive in coming months.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing both international as well as domestic manufacturers of the equipment increasing their costs to prepare for the tariffs,\" DiPaolo said. \u201cYou think that the domestic manufacturers would keep their prices down because they don\u2019t get hit by the tariffs, but they\u2019re seeing this added demand for their equipment.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s supply and demand, said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of Heliene, which focuses on large-scale solar projects. He described the price of a necessary glass component from China going up in February due to a tariff hike. Suppliers in other countries matched the higher price, meaning higher costs no matter the source.",
      "Alexis Abramson, dean of Columbia University's Climate School, said there's no doubt that residential solar is going to be more expensive. That will cut solar adoption, and small and mid-size installers will go under, she said.",
      "It\u2019s just \u201cextremely difficult to offer current and future customers pricing certainty\u201d when trade policy is changing so much, said James Hasselbeck, chief operating officer at New England-based solar company ReVision Energy.",
      "Solar has gotten significantly more affordable in recent years as the technology scales up, improves and gets cheaper to install. Systems can still cost thousands of dollars on average, but the average cost for a residential system is down more than 70% from 2010, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. American consumers have also had a shot at credits that bring the cost down still further, although the future of those is uncertain under the Trump administration.",
      "Commercial and utility-scale project costs have also dropped dramatically.",
      "That's fed rapid growth across the U.S. over the past two decades. In 2024, the commercial segment grew 8% and utility grew 33%, according to an annual report from the association and consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The residential segment fell 32% last year, but experts attribute that to high interest rates and election uncertainty, and said they had expected continued growth before the tariffs hit.",
      "Solar is an important source of clean energy because it doesn't emit the harmful greenhouse gases that coal, natural gas and oil do. Those are massive contributors to Earth's warming.",
      "Trump imposed tariffs during his first term on imported solar cells and modules in 2018 in hopes of slashing reliance on China.",
      "But China subsidized its own domestic overproduction and some U.S. manufacturers accused it of essentially moving operations to four Southeast Asian countries that had a temporary exemption from tariffs.",
      "Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the U.S. is \u201cquickly taking back control of the supply chain from China to build the strongest solar manufacturing base in the world.\u201d The group reported that in 2024, module manufacturing capacity, largely concentrated in the South, grew 190%, and said cell manufacturing \u201cwas reshored for the first time in five years\u201d with company Suniva restarting production.",
      "But Hopper also said sudden changes in policy risk chilling investment and slowing job creation, especially for manufacturers. The group said during the first Trump administration that tariffs issued then were harmful to the industry.",
      "Ultimately, Abramson said she \u201cwould encourage anybody who has been really thinking about putting solar on their roof to really look into locking that in sooner rather than later.\u201d",

      "It cited \u201cexceptional uncertainty\u201d about the future economic situation, saying future rate decisions would be taken on a meeting by meeting basis.",
      "The bank\u2019s move should support economic activity in the 20 countries that use the euro currency by making credit more affordable for consumers and businesses.",
      "The bank\u2019s rate-setting council decided at a meeting in Frankfurt to lower its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25%. The bank has been steadily cutting rates after raising them sharply to combat an outbreak of inflation from 2022 to 2023.",
      "Now that inflation has fallen, growth worries have taken center stage. The economy in the 20 countries that use the euro grew a modest 0.2% in the last three months of 2024. Inflation was 2.2% in March, close to the bank\u2019s target of 2%.",
      "The cut was widely expected by analysts given the sudden shadow cast over the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook by Trump\u2019s April 2 announcement of unexpectedly high tariffs, or import tax, on goods from other countries starting at 10% and ranging as high as 49%. The European Union faces a 20% tariff.",
      "At the bank\u2019s last meeting on March 6, ECB President Christine Lagarde had raised the possibility of an upcoming \u201cpause\u201d in the bank\u2019s series of rate cuts. But that option was practically eliminated by Trump\u2019s announcement.",
      "The bank\u2019s benchmark steers rates throughout the economy. Lower interest rates make it less expensive to borrow money and buy goods ranging from homes to new factory equipment. That supports spending, business investment and hiring.",
      "Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days, but the possibility of the 20% tariff rate he has proposed for Europe left economists and policymakers concerned that the higher costs will weigh on business activity \u2014 and lead to slower growth or even a recession if he carries through. The U.S. is Europe\u2019s largest trade partner with some 4.4 billion euros ($5 billion) in goods and services crossing the Atlantic every day in both directions.",
      "As the European Commission puts it, \u201cthe trans-Atlantic trade relationship is the most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d",
      "Uncertainty is another factor that could slow the economy since Trump\u2019s pause for negotiations leaves it unclear where the tariff rate will actually settle. Businesses may hold off on making decisions if they don\u2019t know what their costs will be.",
      "Economists at Berenberg bank think that by midyear some of the tariffs will be negotiated away, ending at around 12%. However that is still around 10 percentage points higher than average tariffs before Trump. On top of that comes a separate 25% tariff on autos from all countries which will hit Europe\u2019s prominent auto industry hard.",

      "Worries about economic growth fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff onslaught will likely push the European Central Bank to cut interest rates on Thursday for a sixth straight time to make credit more affordable for business and consumers",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Worries about economic growth fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff onslaught will likely push the European Central Bank to cut interest rates on Thursday for a seventh straight time, a move that should make credit more affordable for business and consumers and promote economic activity.",
      "At the bank's last meeting on March 6, ECB President Christine Lagarde had raised the possibility of an upcoming \u201cpause\u201d in the bank's series of rate cuts. But that option was practically eliminated on April 2, when Trump shocked global markets with proposals for unexpectedly high new tariffs, or import taxes, of 10% to 49% on global trading partners.",
      "Analysts say Thursday's meeting of the bank's rate-setting council in Frankfurt should see a quarter-point cut in the bank's benchmark rate to 2.25%. The bank has been steadily cutting rates after raising them sharply to combat an outbreak of inflation from 2022 to 2023.",
      "Now that inflation has fallen, growth worries have taken center stage. The economy in the 20 countries that use the euro grew a modest 0.2% in the last three months of 2024. Inflation was 2.2% in March, close to the bank's target of 2%.",
      "The bank's benchmark steers rates throughout the economy. Lower interest rates make it less expensive to borrow money and buy goods ranging from homes to new factory equipment. That supports spending, business investment and hiring.",
      "Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days, but the possibility of the 20% tariff rate he has proposed for Europe left economists and policymakers concerned that the higher costs will weigh on business activity \u2014 and lead to slower growth or even a recession if he carries through. The U.S. is Europe's largest trade partner with some 4.4 billion euros ($5 billion) in goods and services crossing the Atlantic every day in both directions.",
      "As the European Commission puts it, \u201cthe transatlantic trade relationship is the most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d",
      "Uncertainty is another factor that could slow the economy since Trump's pause for negotiations leaves it unclear where the tariff rate will actually settle. Businesses may hold off on making decisions if they don't know what their costs will be.",
      "Economists at Berenberg bank think that by mid-year some of the tariffs will be negotiated away, ending at around 12%. However that is still around 10 percentage points higher than average tariffs before Trump. On top of that comes a separate 25% tariff on autos from all countries which will hit Europe's prominent auto industry hard.",

      "Cocoa has long provided a lifeline in Ivory Coast but adverse weather and plant diseases have hurt harvests in recent years",
      "N'GATTAKRO, Ivory Coast -- Jean Mari Konan Yao says he's struggling as a cocoa farmer in the west African nation of Ivory Coast, which produces almost half the world\u2019s cocoa supply of the raw ingredient used in chocolate.",
      "Like many in Ivory Coast \u2014 the world's biggest cocoa producer \u2014 Konan Yao says cocoa has long provided a lifeline for him, but adverse weather and plant diseases have hurt harvests in recent years.",
      "Now, cocoa farmers worry even more over President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to impose a 21% tariff on products from Ivory Coast \u2014 the highest among West African nations.",
      "Although Trump has suspended the tariff plans for 90 days pending further review, authorities in Ivory Coast have warned that such tariffs could send the price of cocoa even higher and destabilize the local market by slowing their sales.",
      "Ivory Coast produces between 2 million and 2.5 million metric tons of cocoa annually, with around 200,000 to 300,000 metric tons exported to the United States, according to the Coffee and Cocoa Council.",
      "In 2023, Ivory Coast exported $3.68 billion worth of cocoa beans, its second biggest export after gold. The U.S. was its fourth-largest importer of cocoa beans, after the Netherlands, Malaysia and Belgium, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "For most local cocoa growers, any U.S. tariff could further shake a market already struggling with decreasing yields and shrinking funding that has limited farmers\u2019 ability to meet global demands for chocolate.",
      "\u201cIf we hear the American president is going to put a tax on the price of cocoa, it\u2019s really not good for us, it doesn\u2019t help us,\u201d said another cocoa farmer, Salif Traor\u00e9.",
      "Already, cocoa prices were rising in the country, in part because of insufficient and irregular rainfall in Ivory Coast.",
      "The U.K.-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit research firm has noted a 32% rise in the price of cocoa imported into the United Kingdom over the last three years, partially due to extreme weather conditions in parts of Africa where it\u2019s mainly grown. Together, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon produce about three-quarters of the world\u2019s cocoa.",
      "Cocoa is traded on a regulated, global market. In Ivory Coast, the government usually sets cocoa prices at the onset of each season, with prices reflecting market trends and global prices. The local prices are, however, lower than the global market rates, thereby limiting the farmers' profit from high global prices.",
      "Authorities say they are already considering cocoa price increases if the U.S. tariff comes into effect.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s customs tax is causing us problems. We are already feeling the effects,\u201d said Boss Diarra, coordinator of the local cocoa farmers\u2019 union in Bouafl\u00e9 in central Ivory Coast. He pointed to bags of cocoa that he said farmers have been unable to sell.",
      "Meanwhile, a U.S. tariff could mean more cocoa for European markets, said Bruno Marcel Iriti\u00e9, researcher at the Ivorian F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Polytechnic Institute. Some of the top importers of Ivory Coast cocoa are in Europe, market data show.",

      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as an EU facilitator when she meets with Donald Trump in the White House",
      "MILAN -- Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni will test her mettle as a bridge between the EU and the United States when she meets with U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House on Thursday, the first European leader to have a face-to-face with Trump since he announced, and then suspended, 20% tariffs on European exports.",
      "Meloni secured the meeting at a critical juncture in the trade war as Italy\u2019s leader, but she also has, in a sense, been \u201cknighted\u201d to represent the European Union. She has been in close contact with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen ahead of the trip, and \"the outreach is \u2026 closely coordinated,\" a commission spokeswoman said this week.",
      "\u201cWe know we are in a difficult moment,\" Meloni said this week in Rome. \"Most certainly, I am well aware of what I represent, and what I am defending.\"",
      "The European Union is defending what it calls \u201cthe most important commercial relationship in the world,\u2019\u2019 with annual trade reaching 1.6 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion).",
      "Trade negotiations fall under the European Commission\u2019s authority, which is pushing for a zero-for-zero tariff deal with the U.S. However, Trump administration officials in talks with the EU have yet to publicly show signs of relenting on Trump\u2019s insistence that a baseline 10% tariff be charged on all foreign imports. He paused for 90 days a retaliatory increase to 20%.",
      "The pause has raised some hopes for negotiations, and Meloni\u2019s margins for progress are more in gaining clarity on Trump's goals rather than outright concessions, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt is a very delicate mission,\u201d said Fabian Zuleeg, chief economist at the European Policy Center think tank in Brussels. \u201cThere is the whole trade agenda, and while she\u2019s not officially negotiating, we know that Trump likes to have this kind of informal exchange, which in a sense is a negotiation. So it\u2019s a lot on her plate.\"",
      "As the leader of a far-right party, Meloni is ideologically aligned with Trump on issues including curbing migration, promoting traditional values and skepticism toward multilateral institutions. But stark differences have emerged in Meloni\u2019s unwavering support for Ukraine.",
      "After being the only European leader to attend the Jan. 20 inauguration, Meloni has responded with studied restraint as abrupt shifts in U.S. policy under Trump have frayed the trans-Atlantic alliance. She has denounced the tariffs as \"wrong\" and warned that \u201cdividing the West would be disastrous for everyone,\u201d after Trump\u2019s heated White House exchange with Ukraine\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cShe has been very cautious,\u2019\u2019 said Wolfango Piccoli, an analyst at the London-based Teneo consultancy. \u201cIt is what we need when we have a counterpart that is changing every day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Italy maintains a 40 billion euro trade surplus with the United States, its largest with any country, fueled by Americans\u2019 appetite for Italian sparkling wine, foodstuffs like Parmigiano Reggiano hard cheese and Parma ham, and Italian luxury fashion. These are all sectors critical to the Italian economy, and mostly supported by small- and medium-sized producers who are core center-right voters.",
      "\u201cAll in all, I think she will focus on the very strong economic and trade relations that Italy has with the United States, not just in terms of exports, but also services and energy,\" said Antonio Villafranca, vice president of the ISPI think tank in Milan. \u201cFor example, Italy could even consider importing more gas from the U.S.\u201d",
      "The meeting comes against the backdrop of growing concerns over global uncertainty generated by the escalating tariff wars. Italy\u2019s growth forecast for this year has already been slashed from 1% to 0.5% as a result.",
      "Meloni is also expected to address Trump's demand for NATO partners to increase military spending to 2% of gross domestic product. Italy\u2019s spending, at 1.49% of GDP, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "Experts cautioned, however, against raising expectations over any concrete progress.",
      "\u201cThe best strategy has been to be very circumspect: Get there, get the meeting, get the photo opportunity,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cIf she is able to come back, and give a sense of how Washington wants to frame future relations on trade, defense and Ukraine policy, that would be a huge win.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials, a sign of the high stakes for the United States after its tariffs rattled the economy and caused the administration to assure the public that it would quickly reach deals.",
      "The Republican president attended the meeting alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, top economic advisers with a central role in his trade and tariff policies.",
      "\u201cHopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting.",
      "Afterward, he posted: \u201cA Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!\u201d",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Thursday in Tokyo that his chief trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, told him from Washington that the talks were \u201cvery candid and constructive.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course the talks are not easy, but President Trump stated his intention to make this negotiation a top priority,\u201d Ishiba said. \u201cI believe we had talks that lead to a next step.\u201d",
      "Ishiba said he will closely watch how ministerial talks go and plans to visit Washington to meet with Trump at an appropriate time.",
      "Trump's choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. It's an open test of Trump's reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit the potential damage unleashed by his import taxes.",
      "The sweeping tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%.",
      "The pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports.",
      "With Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9% on other countries' goods and having a longstanding alliance with the U.S., the talks on Wednesday are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies.",
      "U.S. economic rival China, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on the turmoil around Trump's announcements, with its leader, President Xi Jinping, touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner.",
      "Japan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the U.S. Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been \u201cringing off the hook\u201d with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends. Israel and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but Trump has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient.",
      "On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs Trump placed on the 27-state group.",
      "Still, the U.S. president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs as many voters say they returned Trump to the White House with the specific goal of improving the economy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit Wednesday that argues that Trump overstepped his authority by declaring an economic emergency to levy his tariffs, with the Democrat saying in a statement that the tariffs have caused economic chaos.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that Trump's tariff policies would hurt the U.S. economy, a direct warning to a White House trying to sell the import taxes as a long-term positive for the country.",
      "\u201cThe level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\u201d Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.",
      "Japan, like many other nations trying to minimize the possible economic fallout from Trump's tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies.",
      "Although Ishiba has been working hard to coax exemptions out of Trump, the government has said little officially on what concessions it might offer during these talks.",
      "Nor has the administration been transparent about its asks. The Trump administration is seeking to close the $68.5 billion trade deficit with Japan and seeking greater access for U.S. goods in foreign markets, yet the president has also insisted that tariff revenues can be used to pay down the federal budget deficit.",
      "\u201cJapan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and \u2018TRADE FAIRNESS,\u2019\u201d Trump posted Wednesday.",
      "Japan has contended that Trump's tariff measures are likely to violate bilateral trade agreements or World Trade Organization rules. While Ishiba has said he opposes retaliatory tariffs, he also has said he is in no rush to push for a settlement because he doesn't want concessions.",
      "Xi, meanwhile, stopped in Malaysia on Wednesday and told its leader that China will be a collaborative partner and stand with its Southeast Asian neighbors after the global economic shocks.",
      "Xi is touring Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week on a trip that likely was planned before the tariffs' uncertainty but that he's also using to promote Beijing as a source of stability in the region and shore up relationships in that part of the world as he looks for ways to mitigate the 145% tariffs that Trump is keeping on China.",
      "\u201cIn the face of shocks to global order and economic globalization, China and Malaysia will stand with countries in the region to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical ... confrontation, as well as the counter-currents of unilateralism and protectionism,\u201d Xi said in remarks at a dinner with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.",
      "\u201cTogether, we will safeguard the bright prospects of our Asian family,\u201d he added.",
      "Xi has promised Malaysia and Vietnam greater access to Chinese markets on his visits, although few details were shared.",
      "In Washington, Trump has indicated that he also wants to discuss how much the Japanese contribute to the cost of U.S. troops stationed there, largely as a deterrent to China.",
      "Trump\u2019s demand for more defense spending concerns the Japanese government.",
      "Under its national security strategy, Japan aims to double annual defense spending to nearly $10 trillion, or 2% of GDP, in 2027, while there is a concern that Trump may ask for that to be increased to 3% of GDP. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday that the military budget for this year is about 1.8% of Japan\u2019s GDP.",

      "SUVs are typically larger, heavier, harder to control and slower to brake than a standard coupe or sedan",
      "This is the time of year when many parents are thinking about buying a used vehicle for their teen drivers. The vehicle may be a graduation gift or a needed set of wheels for a summer job or trip to college. These days, SUVs are a common choice because of their sales popularity. But which one to get?",
      "Edmunds\u2019 auto experts have rounded up five used SUV recommendations for your teen driver. We considered Edmunds\u2019 evaluations of helpful qualities for teen drivers such as outward visibility, technology features and driving satisfaction. We also considered reliability data and crash test results. Here are Edmunds\u2019 top picks for $20,000 or less. The prices listed are estimates of what you might expect to pay at a nationwide dealership such as CarMax or Carvana.",
      "The last-generation Equinox is a top compact SUV value. It\u2019s affordably priced and has roomy seating, a smooth ride and useful tech features. The standard Teen Driver feature, for example, can remind young drivers to buckle up, and it limits stereo volume and lets parents monitor driving habits. Downmarket interior quality and small cargo space narrow the Equinox\u2019s appeal, but overall the Equinox is a no-nonsense choice.",
      "Look for: Picking an Equinox is pretty easy because it didn\u2019t change much from 2018 to 2024. There\u2019s a lot of Equinox inventory to pick from too. Consider a 2019-and-later model to get a newer infotainment system.",
      "2018-2022 Equinox pricing: approximately $14,000 to $20,000",
      "Lively handling and a high-quality interior make the Mazda CX-5 a fun compact SUV. And while sporty performance isn\u2019t a priority for most parents, going with a CX-5 will neatly circumvent any complaints about an SUV being boring to drive. Other high points include excellent crash test safety ratings and a high predicted RepairPal reliability score. Rear seat and cargo space come up short compared to rivals, but the CX-5 remains an excellent choice.",
      "Look for: Mazda made some improvements during this time. Young drivers will likely appreciate the standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration that became standard in 2019.",
      "2017-2020 CX-5 pricing: approximately $16,000 to $20,000",
      "Is your teen an outdoorsy type? Someone who enjoys camping, surfing, snowboarding or biking? The half-wagon, half-SUV Outback shines here. It has standard all-wheel drive for sure-footed traction in rough or wet terrain. Tall ground clearance lets it go places sportier SUVs can\u2019t, while its lower roof height makes for easy cargo loading. The Outback also gets excellent safety scores from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.",
      "Look for: Subaru redesigned the Outback for 2020, but we think an older Outback is just as good. Subaru made more advanced safety aids, including automatic braking and adaptive cruise control, standard starting in 2019.",
      "2015-2018 Outback pricing: approximately $15,000 to $20,000",
      "Your teen driver needs a larger three-row SUV? Consider an older Highlander. The third row isn\u2019t palatial, but it\u2019s handy enough for a teen who might need to shuttle siblings around. The third row also folds down to create ample cargo space. Crash test scores and predicted RepairPal reliability are favorable too. The biggest complaint your teen might have is that a Highlander is just too sensible and boring.",
      "Look for: the four-cylinder gets the job done, Highlanders with the more powerful V6 are better at accelerating quickly with multiple passengers aboard.",
      "2015-2016 Highlander pricing: approximately $16,000 to $20,000",
      "Like the Outback, the Wrangler isn\u2019t quite an SUV, truck or wagon. It\u2019s its own category. Yes, a four-door Wrangler lacks much of what other SUVs offer. It\u2019s bouncy, loud, gulps fuel and hardly impresses in crash test safety or RepairPal reliability. But its emotional appeal is undeniable. From its legendary off-road capability, and removable doors and roof, the Wrangler scratches a teenage itch for freedom like no other.",
      "Look for: There are two-door and four-door versions of the Wrangler; young drivers will likely enjoy the more personal vibe of the two-door. Regardless of type, the Sport or Sport S trims offer the best combination of features, fun and frugality.",
      "2015-2016 Wrangler pricing: approximately $17,000 to $20,000",
      "Whether your teen driver likes the outdoors, motorsports or simply having enough space for friends and family, there are several good choices for a used SUV to suit your teen\u2019s needs and style.",

      "When Luka Doncic scored 16 points in the first quarter of his playoff debut with his new team, the Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 downtown arena crackled with excitement from fans imagining dream scenarios for their new superstar this spring",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When Luka Doncic scored 16 points in the first quarter of his playoff debut with his new team, the Los Angeles Lakers' downtown arena crackled with excitement from fans probably imagining dream scenarios for their team and its new superstar this spring.",
      "The Timberwolves made sure that dream got ugly quite quickly in Game 1. They also left the Lakers looking for ways to help Doncic before Minnesota runs away with this first-round series.",
      "Doncic scored 37 points and eight rebounds, but it wasn't nearly enough to counter the Wolves' balanced scoring in their 117-95 victory Saturday night.",
      "After an impressive start by their Slovenian superstar, the Lakers were comprehensively embarrassed during their first postseason Game 1 in front of a full home arena since 2012. Los Angeles didn't demonstrate the toughness necessary to hang with the physical, veteran Wolves on defense \u2014 and only Doncic produced an impressive game on offense.",
      "The combination led to a 27-point deficit in the second half and a laugher of a victory for the Wolves, who immediately seized homecourt advantage in the series after finishing just one win behind the Lakers in the regular season.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a great opponent,\u201d JJ Redick said after losing his playoff coaching debut. \u201cThey\u2019re one of the best teams in basketball. It\u2019s not to say our guys weren\u2019t ready to withstand playoff-level basketball. We were mentally ready, and I thought our spirit was right. ... I\u2019m not sure physically we were ready, if that makes sense. When they start playing with a lot of thrust and physicality, we really just couldn\u2019t respond to that.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's superior physicality was obvious for long stretches, even with Rudy Gobert playing only 24 minutes. But the Wolves took control and kept it largely because they hit 21 3-pointers on only 42 attempts.",
      "The Lakers lack a dominant big man after trading Anthony Davis, and Jaden McDaniels took advantage of that while scoring 25 points. But that doesn't explain the Lakers' poor effort on the perimeter, where they have enough athletes to guard most teams competently when they make the effort.",
      "\u201cI think it was physical, (and) they were hitting a lot of 3s,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cWe have to limit their 3s, especially their lasers. We weren\u2019t physical. They were running. They were getting anything they want, and we have to be better.\u201d",
      "Doncic knew that applied to him personally on the offensive end despite his gaudy point total: The gifted passer had just one assist, his lowest total since Game 1 of last season's NBA Finals.",
      "LeBron James also got off to an unimpressive start to his 18th NBA postseason, scoring 19 points and going 1 for 5 on 3-point attempts while producing only three assists and five rebounds in 36 minutes.",
      "The 40-year-old James can't be shaken by one loss, and he focused on clear areas for improvement in Game 2 on Tuesday. He particularly lamented the Lakers' transition defense, which allowed 25 fast-break points.",
      "\u201cThroughout the whole season we did a great job of not allowing teams to get fast break point after fast break point,\u201d James said. \u201cWe already know offensively how dangerous they are, so in giving teams an opportunity to get those easy points, it\u2019s gonna be hard to make that up.\u201d",
      "The Lakers' crowd stayed in the game throughout the night, but the huge second-half deficit obviously dampened the excitement. Minnesota star Anthony Edwards wasn't exactly complimentary about that crowd after the Wolves cruised to victory, either",
      "\u201cAn atmosphere like this, it\u2019s easy for me, man,\" Edwards said. \"I\u2019ve played in Denver, man. Denver is a tough place to play on the road. So I mean, it was nothing.\u201d",

      "DALLAS -- Nathan MacKinnon took a stick to the face, had a part in both of Colorado's strange goals in the second period and capped his night with an empty-netter for his 50th career playoff goal.",
      "And Mackenzie Blackwood backed up the Avalanche in a big way in the goaltender's first playoff game after 252 regular-season games for three teams over eight seasons.",
      "The two goals in the second period put the Avalanche ahead to stay, and Blackwood had 23 saves in a 5-1 win over the Dallas Stars in the opener of their first-round Western Conference playoff series Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI thought it was solid, really solid,\u201d MacKinnon said of the opener of the Avs' eighth consecutive postseason. \u201cWe had a lot of good looks, a lot of attempts. Maybe hit the net a little bit more, but I thought we played a pretty solid two-way game.\u201d",
      "MacKinnon scored on a shot that deflected off Stars defenseman Ilya Lyubushkin, and knuckled past goalie Jake Oettinger late in the second period. That came during an extended power play, a double minor against the Stars after he took a high stick to the face.",
      "\u201cObviously they\u2019re going to key on him like we do on some of their players,\u201d coach Jared Bednar said of last season's NHL MVP. \u201cBut really strong defensive game from him, and obviously get-up and go on the offensive side, he was making plays all night.\u201d",
      "Blackwood stopped four shots in a span of 11 seconds midway through the second period just before MacKinnon assisted on Artturi Lehkonen's goal.",
      "Lehkonen was following his initial shot and falling down after a collision in front of the net when the puck ricocheted off his lower left leg into the top corner of the net. The play was reviewed and officials ruled that there was no kicking motion by Lehkonen while tumbling to the ice with Mavrik Bourque.",
      "There wasn't much Oettinger could do on either of those goals as the Stars lost Game 1 in their eighth consecutive series in the NHL playoffs since 2022. They are 0-7 in series openers under coach Pete DeBoer, six of those coming at home.",
      "\u201cI guess the good news is we\u2019ve come back and won more than our share of those series where we have (lost Game 1),\u201d said DeBoer, whose teams made it to the West final each of the past two seasons. \u201cSo I think we got to concentrate on that.\u201d",
      "Game 2 is Monday night in Dallas, before the series shifts to Denver.",
      "Devon Toews gave Colorado a 3-1 lead with 7:04 left. MacKinnon had an empty-net tally with 3:08 left, 11 seconds before Charlie Coyle scored.",
      "This series-opening loss for the Stars came after they finished the regular season on an 0-5-2 stretch that included four losses at home after being 28-5-3 before that.",
      "Blackwood is one of 11 players who have seen action since being acquired through Colorado's eight in-season trades. He came from San Jose in December and played in 37 games for the Avs.",
      "Those deals included the Avalanche trading Mikko Rantanen on Jan. 24 to Carolina in the East, He played only 13 games before a deadline deal March 7 sent him back to the Central Division with the Stars and included a $96 million, eight-year contract extension.",
      "Rantanen, who had 101 points (34 goals, 67 assists) in 81 playoff games for the Avalanche had three shots and one block over 18 minutes in his postseason debut with the Stars.",
      "Oettinger had 19 saves, three when Colorado had a two-man advantage in the first period when Cale Makar drew two tripping penalties only 36 seconds apart from each other.",
      "Roope Hintz, called for penalty against MacKinnon, got the Stars to 2-1 on his goal with 13:15 left in the game, just before the end of a power play and about a minute after DeBoer called a timeout.",
      "Bednar got his 50th playoff win with the Avs \u2014 in his 82nd postseason game, equal to a full regular season. That broke a tie with Bob Hartley for the most wins by a coach in franchise history. Both won Stanley Cups \u2014 Bednar in 2022, and Hartley in 2001.",

    "story": [
      "Nobody knows where whale sharks, the biggest fish in the sea, are mating",
      "JAMESTOWN, St. Helena -- Whale sharks shouldn't be hard for scientists to find. They are enormous \u2014 they are the biggest fish in the sea and perhaps the biggest fish to have ever lived. They are found in warm oceans all around the world. By shark standards, they are slow swimmers.",
      "But they somehow manage to also be very private: Scientists don't know where they mate, and they've never observed it before.",
      "They do finally have some clues, though. Scientists suspect the magic may be happening in the waters around St. Helena, a remote volcanic island in the South Atlantic Ocean where Napoleon Bonaparte was once exiled and died. It's the only place in the world where adult male and female whale sharks are known to regularly gather in roughly equal numbers \u2014 and food doesn\u2019t seem to be the main attraction.",
      "Kenickie Andrews, the marine conservation project manager at the St. Helena Trust says he\u2019s seen male sharks chasing females, nibbling on their pectoral fins and \u201cdisplaying themselves\u201d to the female sharks, akin to mating rituals observed in other sharks including great whites.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen here is classic shark courtship behavior,\u201d he said. \u201cTo this day we haven\u2019t seen successful copulation, but it is proof (whale sharks) are in our waters trying out these behaviors.\u201d",
      "Whale sharks typically measure from 12 to 18 meters (39 to 59 feet), weigh up to 14 tons and are plankton eaters; all sharks have a unique pattern of white spots on their upper side.",
      "Scientists say they need to know where the sharks are mating and giving birth so they can protect those areas, possibly by creating marine reserves where threats like fishing are banned. Whale sharks are designated as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; the group says their population has been \u201clargely depleted.\u201d",
      "Simon Pierce, who has studied whale sharks globally, said he has photographed suspected mating scars on female sharks in St. Helena, probably from when male sharks bit their pectoral fins to hold onto them and get into mating position.",
      "Suspected whale shark mating behavior has also been reported in Australia and the sharks also gather in places like Mexico, the Arabian Sea and the Maldives, but that seems to amount to male harassment of immature females, explains Pierce, executive director and co-founder of the charity Marine Megafauna Foundation. That's not the case in St. Helena, where adult males and adult females are present.",
      "Fisheries experts in St. Helena have also provided eyewitness accounts of what they said were instances of whale sharks mating. Officials described a lot of thrashing at the water's surface by two enormous sharks touching belly to belly, but those sightings were not captured on video and are not considered sufficient proof by scientists.",
      "Cameron Perry, a research scientist at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, has been working with colleagues on the island to attach camera tags to investigate what the whale sharks are doing, but have run into some technical difficulties: the sharks dive deeper than 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) and the tags can\u2019t withstand the pressure.",
      "\u201cWe have some very tantalizing and teasing video,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe have two sharks about to make contact, and then our camera falls off.\u201d",
      "Perry isn\u2019t sure what the sharks might be doing far below the surface, but hopes new technology being developed will help answer that question. \u201cIt\u2019s just a numbers game in terms of how often we can get in the water.\u201d",
      "Alistair Dove, who has previously conducted research in St. Helena, said he\u2019s seen male whale sharks soliciting contact from adult female sharks, including rotating their claspers, or sexual organs, in what he said was \u201cthe sharky equivalent of an erection.\u201d",
      "\"These sexual behaviors are very, very rare in whale sharks,\u201d said Dove, now CEO of the Museum of Science & History in Jacksonville, Florida.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the huge, unanswered questions about the biggest fish in the world,\u201d Dove said.",
      "Andrews, of the St. Helena Trust, said he was hopeful someone might be able to capture video evidence of whale shark mating, but acknowledged the researchers\u2019 presence and tagging efforts might inadvertently alter the sharks\u2019 mating practices.",
      "\u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want to be seen,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe, like everyone else, they need privacy.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "America\u2019s only rare earths mine has fielded calls from anxious companies since China responded to President Donald Trump's tariffs by limiting exports of seven heavy metals",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- America\u2019s only rare earths mine heard from anxious companies soon after China responded to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs this month by limiting exports of those minerals used for military applications and in many high-tech devices.",
      "\u201cBased on the number of phone calls we\u2019re receiving, the effects have been immediate,\u201d said Matt Sloustcher, a spokesperson for MP Materials, the company that runs the Mountain Pass mine in California's Mojave Desert.",
      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies could lead to a critical shortage of rare earth elements if China maintains its export controls long-term or expands them to seek an advantage in any trade negotiations. The California mine can\u2019t meet all of the U.S. demand for rare earths, which is why Trump is trying to clear the way for new mines.",
      "Rare earth elements are important ingredients in electric vehicles, powerful magnets, advanced fighter jets, submarines, smartphones, television screens and many other products. Despite their name, the 17 elements aren't actually rare, but it's hard to find them in a high enough concentration to make a mine worth the investment.",
      "MP Materials, which acquired the idle Mountain Pass site in 2017, said Thursday it would stop sending its ore to China for processing because of the export restrictions and 125% tariffs on U.S. imports China imposed. The company said it would continue processing nearly half of what it mines on site and store the rest while it works to expand its processing capability.",
      "\u201cSelling our valuable critical minerals under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America's national interests,\u201d MP Materials said in a statement.",
      "Experts say the manufacturers that rely on rare earth elements and other critical minerals will see price increases, but there is likely enough of a global supply available to keep factories operating for now.",
      "The California mine yields neodymium and praseodymium, the light rare earths that are the main components of the permanent rare earth magnets in EVs and wind turbines. But small amounts of some of the heavy rare earths that China has restricted, such as terbium and dysprosium are key to helping the magnets withstand high temperatures.",
      "Already, the price of terbium has jumped 24% since the end of March to reach $933 per kilogram.",
      "\u201cOur estimate suggests that there is enough stockpile in the market to sustain demand for now,\u201d Benchmark Mineral Intelligence rare earths analyst Neha Mukherjee said, adding that shortages may emerge later this year.",
      "China has tremendous power over the rare earths market. The country has the biggest mines, producing 270,000 metric tons (297,624 tons) of minerals last year compared to the 45,000 tons (40,823 metric tons) mined in the U.S. China supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths because it also is home to most of the processing capacity.",
      "The restrictions Beijing put in place on April 4 require Chinese exporters of seven heavy rare earths and some magnets to obtain special licenses. The retaliatory controls reinforced what the Trump administration and manufacturers see as a dire need to build additional U.S. mines and reduce the nation's dependence on China.",
      "Trump has tried, so far unsuccessfully, to strong-arm Greenland and Ukraine into providing more of their rare earths and other critical materials to the United States. Last month, he signed an executive order calling for the federal government to streamline permit approvals for new mines and encourage investments in the projects.",
      "Two companies are trying to develop mines in Nebraska and Montana. Officials at NioCorp and U.S. Critical Minerals said they hoped the push from the White House would help them raise money and obtain the necessary approvals to start digging. NioCorp has worked for years to raise $1.1 billion to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "\u201cAs I sit and I think about how can we deal with this enormous leverage that China has over these minerals that nobody even knows how to pronounce for the most part, we have to deal with this leverage situation,\" NioCorp CEO Mark Smith said. \"And the best way, I think, is that we need to make our own heavy rare earths here in the United States. And we can do that.\"",
      "MP Materials is working to quickly expand its processing capability, partly with the help of some $45 million the company received coming out of the first Trump administration. But after investing nearly $1 billion since 2020, the company doesn't currently have the ability to process the heavy rare earths that China is restricting. MP Materials said it was working expeditiously to change that.",
      "Big U.S. automakers declined to comment about how dependent they are on rare earths and the impact of China's export curbs. Major defense contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which were specifically targeted in China's restrictions along with more than a dozen other defense and aerospace companies, also remained circumspect.",
      "Military technology is a smaller but important user of rare earths. Trump issued an executive order on Tuesday calling for an investigation into the national security implications of being so reliant on China for the elements.",
      "A spokesperson for Lockheed, which makes the F-22 fighter jet, said the company continuously assesses \u201cthe global rare earth supply chain to ensure access to critical materials that support our customers\u2019 missions.\u201d",
      "Some battery makers could start to run short of key elements within weeks, according to Steve Christensen, executive director of the Responsible Battery Coalition, an association representing battery and automakers and battery sellers.",
      "Already, manufacturers have seen the price of antimony, an element used to extend the life of traditional lead-acid batteries, more than double since China restricted exports of it last year. The element isn't one of the 17 rare earths but is among the critical minerals that Trump wants to see produced domestically.",
      "Initially, automakers will likely try to absorb any increase in the cost of their batteries without raising vehicle prices, but that may not be sustainable if China's restrictions remain in place, Christensen said. A 25% tariff Trump put on all imported automobiles and auto parts cars already was expected to increase costs, although the president hinted this week that he might give the industry a temporary reprieve.",
      "The U.S. fulfilled its rare earths needs with domestic sources until the late 1990s. Production largely ended after low-cost Chinese ores flooded global markets. Robots, drones and other new technologies have rapidly increased demand for the raw materials.",
      "NioCorp recently signed a contract to do more exploratory drilling on its site this summer to help prove to the Export-Import Bank that enough rare earth minerals rest underground near Elk Creek, Nebraska, to justify an $800 million loan to help finance the project.",
      "But a new rare earths mine is years away from operating in the U.S. NioCorp estimates if all goes well with its fundraising, the site where it hopes to mine and process niobium, scandium, titanium and an assortment of rare earths possibly might be running by the end of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "U.S. Critical Minerals plans to dig up several tons of ore in Montana this summer so it can test out processing methods it has been developing. The Sheep Creek project isn't as far along as the Nebraska project, but U.S. Critical Minerals Director Harvey Kaye said the site has promising ore deposits with high concentrations of rare earths.",

      "Independent scientists described the findings as interesting, but not nearly enough to show the existence of life on another planet.",
      "\u201cIt is the strongest sign to date of any possibility of biological activity outside the solar system,\" Cambridge astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan said during a livestream on Thursday.",
      "By analyzing data from NASA and the European Space Agency's Webb Space Telescope, the researchers found evidence of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the atmosphere of the planet known as K2-18b. The planet is 124 light-years away; one light-year is equivalent to nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "On Earth, those two compounds are produced primarily by microbial life, such as marine phytoplankton.",
      "The planet is more than double Earth\u2019s size and more than 8 times more massive. It's in the so-called habitable zone of its star. The study appeared in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "Madhusudhan stressed that further research is needed to rule out any errors or the possibility of other processes, besides living organisms, that could produce the compounds.",

      "\u201cMany of the turtle populations have come back, though some haven\u2019t,\u201d said Duke ecologist Stuart Pimm, who was not involved with the research. \u201cOverall, the sea turtle story is one of the real conservation success stories.\"",
      "The study looked at 48 populations of sea turtles around the world. Scientists measured the impacts of threats such as hunting, pollution, coastal development and climate change to the marine animals. In more than half of the areas studied, threats are declining overall, the study found.",
      "But there are some exceptions. Sea turtle populations in the Atlantic Ocean are more likely to be recovering than those in Pacific waters. And leatherback turtles are not faring as well as other species.",
      "Globally, leatherbacks are considered vulnerable to extinction, but many groups are critically endangered, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "All seven of the regions where leatherbacks are found face high environmental risks, said study co-author Bryan Wallace, a wildlife ecologist at Ecolibrium in Colorado.",
      "Leatherback turtles are famous for making the longest known marine migrations of any animal \u2013 with some individuals swimming as many as 3,700 miles (5,955 kilometers) each way. That feat moves them through a wide swath of regions and may expose them to unique risks, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, green turtles are still considered endangered globally, but their populations show signs of recovery in many regions of the world, researchers found.",
      "\u201cBy ending commercial harvests and allowing them time to rebound, their populations are now doing really well\u201d in coastal waters off many regions of Mexico and the U.S., said co-author Michelle Mar\u00eda Early Capistr\u00e1n, a Stanford University researcher who has conducted fieldwork in both countries.",

      "The Trump administration plans to rewrite part of the Endangered Species Act that prohibits harming the habitats of endangered and threatened species",
      "The Trump administration plans to eliminate habitat protections for endangered and threatened species in a move environmentalists say would lead to the extinction of critically endangered species due to logging, mining, development and other activities.",
      "At issue is a longstanding definition of \u201charm\u201d in the Endangered Species Act, which has included altering or destroying the places those species live. Habitat destruction is the biggest cause of extinction, said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service said in a proposed rule issued Wednesday that habitat modification should not be considered harm because it's not the same as intentionally targeting a species, called \u201ctake.\u201d Environmentalists argue that the definition of \u201ctake,\u201d though, has always included actions that harm species, and the definition of \u201charm\u201d has been upheld by the Supreme Court.",
      "The proposed rule \u201ccuts the heart out of the Endangered Species Act,\u201d said Greenwald. \u201cIf (you) say harm doesn\u2019t mean significant habitat degradation or modification, then it really leaves endangered species out in the cold.\u201d",
      "For example, he said spotted owls and Florida panthers both are protected because the current rule forbids habitat destruction. But if the new rule is adopted, someone who logs in a forest or builds a development would be unimpeded as long as they could say they didn't intend to harm an endangered species, he said.",

      "A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokeswoman referred The Associated Press to the Department of Interior, which declined to comment.",
      "Environmental groups will challenge the rule in court if it is adopted, said Drew Caputo, an attorney at Earthjustice.",
      "He said the proposal \u201cthreatens a half-century of progress in protecting and restoring endangered species,\u201d including bald eagles, gray wolves, Florida manatees and humpback whales. He said that's because the current rule \u201crecognizes the common-sense concept that destroying a forest, beach, river, or wetland that a species relies on for survival constitutes harm to that species.\u201d",
      "The question is whether the Trump administration is entitled to repeal a rule that was upheld specifically by the Supreme Court and therefore subject to precedent, said Patrick Parenteau, an emeritus professor at the Vermont Law and Graduate School who has handled endangered species cases.",
      "Because of the current definition of harm, \u201cmany, many millions of acres of land has been conserved\u201d to help keep species alive, he said.",

      "The FTC contends Meta has used a monopoly in its technology that facilitates connecting with friends and family to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped.

    "story": [
      "The speed and scope of the federal government\u2019s efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges and universities across the country",
      "WASHINGTON -- At first, the bar association for immigration attorneys began receiving inquiries from a couple students a day. These were foreigners studying in the U.S., and they'd discovered in early April their legal status had been terminated with little notice. To their knowledge, none of the students had committed a deportable offense.",
      "In recent days, the calls have begun flooding in. Hundreds of students have been calling to say they have lost legal status, seeking advice on what to do next.",
      "\u201cWe thought it was going to be something that was unusual,\u201d said Matthew Maiona, a Boston-based immigration attorney who is getting about six calls a day from panicked international students. \u201cBut it seems now like it\u2019s coming pretty fast and furious.\u201d",
      "The speed and scope of the federal government's efforts to terminate the legal status of international students have stunned colleges across the country. Few corners of higher education have been untouched, as schools ranging from prestigious private universities, large public research institutions and tiny liberal arts colleges discover status terminations one after another among their students.",
      "At least 600 students at more than 90 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated in recent weeks, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials. Advocacy groups collecting reports from colleges say hundreds more students could be caught up in the crackdown.",
      "Around 1.1 million international students were in the United States last year \u2014 a source of essential revenue for tuition-driven colleges. International students are not eligible for federal financial aid, and their ability to pay tuition often factors into whether they will be admitted to American schools. Often, they pay full price.",
      "Many of the students losing their legal status are from India and China, which together account for more than half the international students at American colleges. But the terminations have not been limited to those from any one part of the world, lawyers said.",
      "Four students from two Michigan universities are suing Trump administration officials after their F-1 student status was terminated last week. Their attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, Ramis Wadood, said the students never received a clear reason why.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know, and that\u2019s the scary part,\u201d he said.",
      "The students were informed of the terminations by their universities via email, which came as a shock, Wadood said. The reason given was that there was a \u201ccriminal records check and/or that their visa was revoked,\u201d Wadood said, but none of them were charged or convicted of crimes. Some had either speeding or parking tickets, but one didn\u2019t have any, he said. Only one of the students had known their entry visa was revoked, Wadood said.",
      "Students have filed similar lawsuits in several other states, arguing they were denied due process.",
      "In New Hampshire, a federal judge last week granted a temporary restraining order to restore the status of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, Xiaotian Liu, while he challenges the revocation of his visa.",
      "At many colleges, officials learned the legal immigration status of some international students had been terminated when staff checked a database managed by the Department of Homeland Security. In the past, college officials say, legal statuses typically were updated after colleges told the government the students were no longer studying at the school.",
      "The system to track enrollment and movements of international students came under the control of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after 9/11, said Fanta Aw, CEO of NAFSA, an association of international educators. She said recent developments have left students fearful of how quickly they can be on the wrong side of enforcement.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t need more than a small number to create fear,\u201d Aw said. \u201cThere\u2019s no clarity of what are the reasons and how far the reach of this is.\u201d",
      "Her group says as many as 1,300 students have lost visas or had their status terminated, based on reports from colleges.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security and State Department did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "Foreigners who are subject to removal proceedings are usually sent a notice to appear in immigration court on a certain date, but lawyers say affected students have not received any notices, leaving them unsure of next steps to take.",
      "Some schools have told students to leave the country to avoid the risk of being detained or deported. But some students have appealed the terminations and stayed in the United States while those are processed.",
      "Still others caught in legal limbo aren't students at all. They had remained in the U.S. post-graduation on \u201coptional practical training,\u201d a one-year period \u2014 or up to three for science and technology graduates \u2014 that allows employment in the U.S. after completing an academic degree. During that time, a graduate works in their field and waits to receive their H-1B or other employment visas if they wish to keep working in the U.S.",
      "Around 242,000 foreigners in the U.S. are employed through this \u201coptional practical training.\u201d About 500,000 are pursuing graduate degrees, and another 342,000 are undergraduate students.",
      "Among the students who have filed lawsuits is a Georgia Tech Ph.D. student who is supposed to graduate on May 5, with a job offer to join the faculty. His attorney Charles Kuck said the student was likely targeted for termination because of an unpaid traffic fine from when the student lent his car to a friend. Ultimately, the violation was dismissed.",
      "\u201cWe have case after case after case exactly like that, where there is no underlying crime,\u201d said Kuck, who is representing 17 students in the federal lawsuit. He said his law firm has heard from hundreds of students.",
      "\u201cThese are kids who now, under the Trump administration, realize their position is fragile,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve preyed on a very vulnerable population. These kids aren\u2019t hiding. They\u2019re in school.\u201d",
      "Some international students have been adapting their daily routines.",
      "A Ph.D. student from China at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill said she has begun carrying around her passport and immigration paperwork at the advice of the university\u2019s international student office. The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities, said she has been distressed to see the terminations even for students like her without criminal records.",

They told the magistrate they were collecting the ants for fun and did not know that it was illegal.",

      "The illegal export of the ants \"not only undermines Kenya\u2019s sovereign rights over its biodiversity but also deprives local communities and research institutions of potential ecological and economic benefits,\u201d KWS said in a statement.",
      "Kenya has in the past fought against the trafficking of body parts of larger species of wild animals such as elephants, rhinos and pangolins among others. But the cases against the four men represent \"a shift in trafficking trends \u2014 from iconic large mammals to lesser-known yet ecologically critical species,\u201d KWS said.",
      "The two Belgians were arrested in Kenya\u2019s Nakuru county, which is home to various national parks. The 5,000 ants were found in a guest house where they were staying, and were packed in 2,244 test tubes that had been filled with cotton wool to enable the ants to survive for months.",
      "The other two men were arrested in Nairobi where they were found to have 400 ants in their apartments.",
      "Kenyan authorities valued the ants at 1 million shillings ($7,700). The prices for ants can vary greatly according to the species and the market.",
      "Philip Muruthi, a vice president for conservation at the Africa Wildlife Foundation in Nairobi, said ants play the role of enriching soils, enabling germination and providing food for species such as birds.",
      "\u201cThe thing is, when you see a healthy forest, like Ngong forest, you don\u2019t think about what is making it healthy. It is the relationships all the way from the bacteria to the ants to the bigger things,\u201d he said.",
      "Muruthi warned of the risk of trafficking species and exporting diseases to the agricultural industry of the destination countries.",
      "\u201cEven if there is trade, it should be regulated and nobody should be taking our resources just like that,\u201d he said.",

      "Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump\u2019s Federal Trade Commission\u2019s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: \u2018It is better to buy than compete.\u2019 True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \u201cneutralize perceived competitive threats,\u201d the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "\u201cUnable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company\u2019s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,\u201d the FTC says.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \u201cacqui-hires\u201d \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "\u201cThe FTC already has the difficult task, whether it\u2019s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we\u2019re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,\u201d said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. \u201cAnd I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.\u201d",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC\u2019s lawsuit \u201cdefies reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission\u2019s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC \u201cmust prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.\" This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram.",
      "Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial.",
      "Boasberg \u201cseems to be skeptical\u201d of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a \u201cfact question,\" which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market.",
      "While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.",
      "\u201cInstagram is now Meta\u2019s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company\u2019s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\u201d said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. \u201cThe trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn\u2019t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.\u201d",
      "But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.",
      "\u201cA big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it\u2019s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing \u2014 these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cAnd this will be a case that speaks directly to that.\u201d",

    "summary": "Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen took the president and government of El Salvador to task for what he said was a setup to shame him and Kilmar Abrego Garcia.",
    "story": [
      "The senator said the drinks were placed by El Salvador officials.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., set out to El Salvador this week to find Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man at the center of an erroneous deportation, and get answers about his condition.",
      "While he was relieved to get a chance to meet the Abrego Garcia face to face on Thursday, the senator slammed El Salvador President Nayib Bukele and President Donald Trump for what he said was a setup to defame him and the deportee.",
      "Van Hollen said Friday that what he called \"margarita-gate\" was manufactured by Bukele and his officials after they posted a photo of his meeting with Abrego Garcia at a table with what appeared to be filled margarita glasses.",
      "The senator said those glasses were put on the table partway during the meeting by El Salvador officials and that neither he nor the deportee touched the drinks.",
      "\"Everything happens because Bukele says it could happen. And if you look at the video you sent out right afterwards with the fake margaritas, you can see that all of that was a setup,\" Van Hollen told reporters.",
      "The senator poked holes in the story that was being spread by Bukele's and Trump's allies and said the entire meeting was suspect from the beginning.",
      "After being denied access to CECOT, the super prison that the government originally said was holding Abrego Garcia, Van Hollen said he was ready to fly back to the U.S. Thursday but got a message that the deportee was available to meet.",
      "The El Salvador government tried to have the meeting poolside, but the senator said he had them take it indoors in a dining area. During the meeting, Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia had glasses of water and a coffee cup on their tables, which appeared in a photo posted by the senator.",
      "The senator said that at one point during the hourlong meeting, officials put glasses on the table that appeared to have liquid inside with salt or sugar rims on top. Van Hollen said he had no idea what the liquid was.",
      "The glass in front of Abrego Garcia had less liquid than the other glass, according to Van Hollen.",
      "\"They tried to make it look like, I assume, that he drank out of it,\" the senator said.",
      "Van Hollen said the insinuations about the margarita glasses don't hold up under scrutiny.",
      "\"They made a mistake,\" he said of the government officials. \"If you sip out of one of those glasses, some of whatever it was, salt or sugar, would disappear. You would see a gap. There's no gap. No one drank anything.\"",
      "El Salvador's government has not commented on the senator's claim.",
      "Trump was asked about the photo of the meetings with the glasses earlier Friday and criticized Van Hollen as \"fake\" and repeated disputed claims that Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 member.",
      "\"They're all fake, and they have no interest in that prisoner. That prisoner's record is unbelievably bad,\" Trump said before listing crimes of which other MS-13 members have been convicted.",
      "None of the allegations made about Abrego Garcia's being part of MS-13 have been made in court documents. Abrego Garcia's family and attorneys have denied the gang allegations.",
      "Van Hollen stressed that Trump is trying to divert attention from the fact that the U.S. government is not complying with the Supreme Court's unanimous order that it facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. by bringing up gang violence.",
      "\"I mean, this is a guy who's been in CECOT. This guy has been detained. They want to create this appearance that life was just lovely for Kilmar, which, of course, is a big fat lie,\" he said.",
      "The senator added that the case goes beyond Abrego Garcia.",
      "\"This case is not about just one man. It's about protecting the constitutional rights of everyone who resides in the United States of America,\" he said.",

      "The Navy said it canceled a speaking engagement at its academy in Annapolis, Maryland, with popular podcaster and author Ryan Holiday because it wanted to steer clear of what it saw as political content aimed at young naval officers.",
      "Holiday, who speaks frequently about the value of stoicism and has written several books, including \"The Obstacle is the Way,\" said he had planned to speak to the midshipmen about the \"pursuit of wisdom.\"",
      "Holiday said he shared his briefing slides in advance with the Navy, which included a reference to the New York Times' story about the U.S. Naval Academy's recent decision to pull some 381 books from its library. The Navy asked him to omit the reference, and Holiday said he refused.",
      "\"The idea that there are topics that are off limits or that they can't handle is absurd on its face,\" Holiday told ABC News.",
      "When asked why Holiday's speech was canceled, the Navy said it opted to make a \"schedule change that aligns with its mission of preparing midshipmen for careers of service to our country.\"",
      "\"The Naval Academy is an apolitical institution,\" it added. \"It is focused on developing midshipmen morally, mentally and physically in order to cultivate honorable leaders, create a culture of excellence and prepare future officers for military service.\"",
      "Holiday said the Navy hadn't given him guidance in advance of the speech and that he didn't see his presentation as overtly political because he wasn't telling the midshipmen how to vote. He said it shouldn't have been a surprise to the Navy that he'd want to discuss current events.",
      "\"I assumed we had the basic ... standards of academic independence,\" Holiday said.",
      "The Navy pulled the books after President Donald Trump ordered the military to stop \"promoting, advancing, or otherwise inculcating the following un-American, divisive, discriminatory, radical, extremist, and irrational theories.\"",
      "Included in the list of books removed from the academy library is \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" by Maya Angelou and \"How to be an Antiracist\" by Ibram X. Kendi.",
      "A separate visit to the academy by filmmaker Ken Burns also was canceled recently, although the cancelation does not appear to be tied to a dispute over content. A spokesperson for Burns said the award-winning documentarian had planned to meet privately with faculty and staff later this month and now hopes to visit the school in October instead.",

      "The new site appears to use theories from the final report of the Republican-led\u00a0Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic,\u00a0released in December 2024.\u00a0There has never been a consensus or a \"smoking gun\" to explain what started the pandemic.",
      "The COVID.gov page, as recently as last week, listed resources for testing, treatment, and vaccination against COVID-19, as well as information for Long COVID.",
      "The five pieces of evidence put forth by the White House\u00a0for the theory include the following assertions: that the \"virus possesses a biological characteristic that is\u00a0not found in nature,\" that data shows all cases \"stem from\u00a0a single introduction into humans,\" that \"Wuhan is home to China's foremost SARS research lab,\" that researchers at that research lab \"were\u00a0sick with COVID-like symptoms\u00a0in the fall of 2019,\" and that \"if there was evidence of a natural origin it would have\u00a0already surfaced.\"",
      "The page includes claims that government officials, including former NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, helped edit and then amplify\u00a0a research paper\u00a0on the origins of COVID-19 published in 2020 that supported natural origin theory.",
      "The current page suggests this paper's explicit intention was to discredit the lab leak theory and remove any doubt that the origins were of natural origin. This is not a new accusation and in the past\u00a0 Fauci\u00a0and the paper authors disagreed with the accusations that the paper was manipulated or had any specific goal.",

      "In October 2021, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u00a0released\u00a0a declassified report on the intelligence community's views on the origin conundrum, which also leaned toward a natural spillover, but represented divided views. A subsequent\u00a0declassified report\u00a0released in 2023 also noted that most of the intelligence community was split on the origins of the pandemic.\u00a0In reports, US agencies generally agreed that the virus was most likely not developed as a biological weapon and that China's leaders did not know about the virus before the start of the global pandemic.",
      "The new\u00a0splash page features a photo of Fauci and the pardon that former President Joe Biden granted him, highlighting that it was for \"any offenses.\" The page also accuses federal agencies, including NIH and HHS, of breaking laws and violating rules about transparency and cooperation with Congressional investigation.\u00a0The agencies complied with FOIA requests and other regulatory requests from the committee and also appeared before lawmakers when asked to testify.",
      "The web page also calls into question the efficacy of social distancing, masking and lockdown. The White House also criticized the response from New York officials.",
      "Fauci testified about the accusations before lawmakers in 2024, saying that accusations about him covering up or influencing research about the lab leak theory are untrue.",
      "\"The accusation being circulated that I influenced the scientists to change their minds by bribing them with millions of dollars in grant money is absolutely false, and simply preposterous. I had no input into the content of the published paper,\" Fauci said in June of 2024.",
      "\"The second issue is a false accusation that I tried to cover up the possibility that the virus originated from a lab. In fact, the truth is exactly the opposite,\" Fauci said during that 2024 hearing.",
      "This is not the first time that the White House has made clear its position on the origins of COVID-19. In January, President Trump said that COVID-19 had \"strained\" his relationship with President Xi Jinping of China.",

      "Homan spoke with \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl in an interview that will air this Sunday about the case and repeated the Trump administration's allegations that Abrego Garcia is an MS-13 member and a violent threat to the public.",
      "\"We removed a public safety threat, a national security threat, a violent gang member from the United States,\" he alleged.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family members have denied that he is a member of MS-13, and the gang allegations are being disputed in court.",
      "Watch more of Jonathan Karl's interview with Tom Homan on \"This Week\" at 9 a.m. Sunday on ABC.",
      "However, much of the evidence that has been cited by President Donald Trump and his allies, such as clothing they argue symbolizes gang membership, has not been brought up in court since the current administration began litigating this case.",
      "The Supreme Court unanimously ordered the administration to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. for a trial. As of Friday, the administration has not taken active steps to do so.",
      "When asked by Karl about the order, Homan claimed the Trump administration does not have the right or ability to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. and argued Abrego Garcia is under the authority of the El Salvador government.",
      "\"I understand that 'facilitate,' but he's also in the custody -- he's a citizen and a national of the country of El Salvador. El Salvador would certainly have to cooperate in that,\" Homan said.",
      "\"But again, I'm out of the loop on that. I'm not an attorney. I'm not litigating this case. We'll do whatever the law says we have to do, but I think and I stand by the fact [that] I think we did the right thing here,\" he said.",
      "Homan also joined Trump and other Republicans in their criticism of Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who traveled to El Salvador this week and met with Abrego Garcia.",
      "\"You know, what bothers me more than that is a U.S. senator traveled to El Salvador on taxpayer dime to meet with an MS-13 gang member, [a] public safety threat, terrorist,\" Homan said, without providing evidence that Van Hollen is using taxpayer money for the trip.",
      "When ABC News reached out to Van Hollen's office for comment on how the trip was funded, his office replied, \"the Senator traveled in his official capacity with bipartisan approval to follow up on the case of a constituent and conduct oversight of U.S. foreign assistance programs. He did fly commercial.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia has never been convicted of a crime in the U.S., and his wife, Jennifer Vasquez, told ABC News on Wednesday that her husband has \"never been convicted for anything.\"",
      "Homan accused the senator of not taking time to meet with victims of MS-13 gang members in his state and inaction under the Biden administration to address border concerns.",
      "\"What concerns me is Van Hollen never went to the border the last four years under Joe Biden. ... What shocks me is he's remained silent on the travesty that happened on the southern border. Many people died, thousands of people died,\" he said.",
      "Upon returning to the U.S., Van Hollen told reporters his trip was about more than Abrego Garcia's case.",
      "\"This case is not only about one man, as important as that is,\" Van Hollen said. \"It is about protecting fundamental freedoms and the fundamental principle in the Constitution for due process that protects everybody who resides in America.\"",

    "story": [
      "George Stephanopoulos toured the damage with the governor and the first lady.",
      "Days after an arson attack damaged his official residence, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro sat down with Good Morning America co-anchor George Stephanopoulos for an exclusive interview and a tour of the charred rooms.",
      "\"This is sadly a real part of our society today. And it needs to be universally condemned, George,\" Shapiro said regarding the rise of politically motivated threats and attacks that the Department of Homeland Security has warned about in recent years.",
      "Watch more of George Stephanopoulos' exclusive interview with Gov. Josh Shapiro on \"Good Morning America\" at 7 a.m. Friday on ABC.",
      "\"I don't care if it's coming from the left, from the right. I don't care if it's coming from someone who you voted for or someone who you didn't vote for, someone on your team or someone on the other team,\" Shapiro continued.",
      "The governor spoke with Stephanopoulos from one of the fire-damaged rooms at the governor's residence in Harrisburg on Thursday. For the first time together, the governor and first lady Lori Shapiro also toured the damage, along with Stephanopoulos.",
      "The attack happened early Sunday, hours after the Shapiro family hosted more than two dozen people for the first night of Passover. The assailant hopped a fence at the governor's mansion, broke windows and hurled Molotov cocktails made from beer bottles and gasoline, police said.",
      "Shapiro and his family were in the residence at the time of the fire but were evacuated safely and not injured, according to state police.",
      "Harrisburg Fire Chief Brian Enterline described it as \"surreal\" to see fire shooting from the governor's residence. Luckily, the door from the main dining room was closed at the time of the blaze, keeping the fire from spreading into the living quarters. Had the door not been closed, Enterline said Shapiro and his family would no doubt have been at risk.",
      "The suspect in the attack -- 38-year-old Cody Balmer -- turned himself in and allegedly told police he would have attacked Shapiro with a hammer if he happened upon the governor inside the residence, according to court documents.",
      "The suspected arsonist allegedly decided to firebomb the Democratic governor's official residence because of \"what he wants to do to the Palestinian people\" and \"based upon perceived injustices to the people of Palestine,\" according to police search warrants.",
      "Balmer faces eight criminal charges, including attempted murder, terrorism and aggravated arson. So far, prosecutors have not invoked a hate crime law, which in Pennsylvania is known as ethnic intimidation.",
      "Balmer -- a mechanic who had previously expressed disdain for Democrats on social media -- was denied bail at his arraignment on Monday.",
      "During the hearing, his attorney said Balmer is indigent and asked for a \"reasonable monetary bail,\" but the judge denied it, saying that while he appreciated that Balmer turned himself in, there were no conditions that could keep him from being a danger to the community.",

    "summary": "A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ordered an immediate halt to the planned firings of nearly 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "About 1,500 employees were set to be jettisoned at the bureau.",
      "A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ordered an immediate halt to the planned firings of nearly 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and is ordering the Trump administration to hand over communications and make top officials available for testimony to determine whether they deliberately violated one of her court orders.",
      "District Judge Amy Berman Jackson told attorneys for the government she was \"deeply concerned\" about the apparently rushed efforts to implement a Reduction In Force, or RIF, of approximately 1483 employees at the CFPB which was set to take effect at 6 pm tonight.",
      "Jackson said the moves by CFPB leadership, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and general counsel of the OMB Mark Paoletta, in apparent coordination with a staffer from Elon Musk's DOGE operation, Gavin Kliger, may be in direct violation of a preliminary injunction she had put in place -- which the D.C. Circuit upheld in part. That injunction required terminations at the agency to be carried out only after \"particularized assessments\" of individual employees' performance.",
      "She told attorneys from the Justice Department the reductions in force were \"not going to happen in the meantime\" and ordered them to advise the agency leadership to make that clear to employees who had been informed they would be ousted. Many of those employees sat in her courtroom Friday, and several broke into tears following the hearing.",
      "Jackson further ordered a hearing for April 28 where she said Paoletta should be prepared to testify under oath, and Kliger should also plan to be in attendance to potentially provide testimony. She also said the government should retain and be prepared to provide any communications between Paoletta, Vought and Kliger in advance of the hearing to help her determine whether her preliminary injunction was deliberately violated.",
      "The Trump administration had begun the process this week of firing 1,474 employees at the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau, according to a sworn declaration from Paoletta, the agency's chief legal officer.",
      "The administration plans to run the agency with a 206-person staff, according to court filings Friday morning, a steep decrease from the 1,680 employees who previously worked for the consumer-protection agency. Some departments within the CFPB were cut entirely or reduced to a single employee, according to Paoletta.",
      "\"An approximately 200-person agency allows the Bureau to fulfill its statutory duties and better aligns with the new leadership's priorities and management philosophy,\" Paoletta wrote.",
      "According to Paoletta, agency leadership conducted a \"particularized assessment\" of each department to determine how to run the CFPB with the \"smaller, more efficient operation.\"",
      "\"Leadership has discovered many instances in which the Bureau's activities have pushed well beyond the limits of the law,\" he wrote.",
      "The CFPB, created by Congress to safeguard Americans against unfair business practices in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, has been targeted for elimination by President Donald Trump as part of his efforts to slash the federal government.",
      "Trump has said the CFPB is \"very important to get rid of\" and that the organization was \"set up to destroy some very good people.\"",
      "Its oversight applies to everything from mortgages to credit cards to bank fees to student loans to data collection. By law, the CFPB has the rare ability to issue new rules and to impose fines against companies who break them.",
      "Since its establishment in 2011 through last June, the CFPB said it has clawed back $20.7 billion for American consumers.",

    "summary": "\"It\u2019s not our war,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, after talks with European allies in Paris.",
    "story": [
      "\"It\u2019s not our war,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.",
      "After wrapping up what he described as a productive round of talks toward ending the war in Ukraine hosted in Paris, Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday laid out a surprising ultimatum for all parties involved, declaring that the U.S. was willing to move on from the negotiations if they didn't yield results soon.",
      "\"We need to figure out here, now within a matter of days, whether this is doable in the short term, because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on,\" Rubio said on the tarmac as he left France early Friday morning.",
      "\"We have other priorities to focus on as well,\" he added. \"It's not our war.\"",
      "Later, at the White House, President Donald Trump echoed Rubio's assertion -- saying that the U.S. would make a determination \"very shortly.\"",
      "\"Now, if for some reason, one of the two parties makes it very difficult, we're just going to say you're foolish, you're fools, you're horrible people, and we're going to just take a pass,\" Trump said without specifying which party. \"But hopefully, we won't have to do that.\"",
      "Trump also struck an optimistic note, and declined to say whether he would in fact walk away from the talks entirely or if he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin was stalling.",
      "\"My whole life has been one big negotiation. And I know when people are playing us and I know when they're not, and I have to see an enthusiasm to want to end it. And I think I see that enthusiasm,\" he said. \"I think I see it from both sides.\"",
      "While the president declined to set a specific deadline for progress, Rubio looked ahead to a new round of talks slated to take place in London early next week as a potentially decisive engagement, saying he may attend -- but only if the meeting appeared poised to result in action rather than just talk.",
      "The Trump administration's apparent ultimatum comes as negotiators have grown increasing frustrated over the lack of momentum, especially from the Russian side.",
      "Officials say that the Kremlin has repeatedly insisted on reprieve from economic sanctions in exchange for taking incremental steps toward peace. Relief for Moscow would require action from both the U.S. and its allies, and so far, it appears to be a step that European leaders are unwilling to take.",
      "\"I always remind everybody that part of the sanctions against Russia, many of them are European sanctions that we can't lift,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio sought to ramp up the pressure on Moscow during a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday, according to officials familiar with the conversation, who add that the administration was hopeful progress could be made in the hours between their talk and the secretary's departure from France.",
      "But in the wake of Rubio's public comments, Moscow signaled it was in no hurry to strike a deal.",
      "\"We believe that certain progress can, in fact, already be acknowledged,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. \"There are already some developments, but, of course, there are still many complicated discussions ahead.\"",
      "These developments come as one potential indicator of progress -- a 30-day ceasefire intended to pause strikes on energy infrastructure targets\u2014has expired, with no word from Putin on whether Moscow will restart attacks on those targets.",
      "Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of repeatedly violating the agreement, which was brokered by the Trump administration last month.",
      "While it's unclear if Rubio and Trump's comments will have any impact on Moscow, they are likely to stoke anxiety in Kyiv. So far administration officials have given no indication that the U.S. would reup support for Ukraine's war effort if it abandons peace negotiations.",
      "\"Although the Trump administration is right to act with a sense of urgency, threatening to wash our hands of the peace talks could perversely incentivize Russian intransigence since Moscow will likely calculate that the United States walking away would lead to an end to American aid for Ukraine,\" said John Hardie, the deputy director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracy's Russia Program.",
      "\"Instead, Washington should focus on putting pressure on Russia, including by tightening sanctions on Russian oil revenue,\" Hardie continued. \"Meanwhile, Washington should strive to help Ukrainian forces exhaust Russian offensive potential to show Putin he cannot gain through further fighting.\"",
      "If the U.S. does in fact withdraw from negotiations, Rubio said only that members of the Trump administration would \"do what we can on the margins.\"",

    "story": [
      "\u201cI won't stop fighting until he returns home,\" she told \"Good Morning America.\"",
      "Jennifer Vasquez Sura, the wife of wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia, spoke exclusively on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" Friday morning in her first interview since Sen. Chris Van Hollen met with her husband in El Salvador Thursday.",
      "Van Hollen late Thursday released a photo of himself with Abrego Garcia, which was the first time Vasquez Sura had seen him since spotting him in a photo among several other migrants being brought into El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison last month.",
      "\"It was very overwhelming,\" Vasquez Sura said of seeing the image Thursday night.",
      "\"The most important thing for me, my children, his mom, his brother, his sibling, was to see him alive, and we saw him alive,\" she told GMA's Michael Strahan.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who has been living with his wife and children in Maryland, was deported in March to El Salvador's CECOT prison -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13.",
      "The Trump administration, while acknowledging that Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador in error, has said that his alleged MS-13 affiliation makes him ineligible to return to the United States.",
      "After a federal judge ruled earlier this month that the Trump administration must \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return, and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that ruling, the polarizing case has become a test of the power of the executive branch versus the courts.",
      "Vasquez Sura, speaking to GMA, denied that her husband is a member of MS-13 or any other gang.",
      "\"I won't stop fighting until he returns home, until I know that he's safe,\" Vasquez Sura told Strahan.",
      "\"It's been 37 days since March 12, since my husband was abducted,\" said Vasquez Sura. \"It's been an emotional, emotional rollercoaster, honestly.\"",
      "\"We've been together over seven years. It's been amazing. He is very a loving husband, and amazing father. We were just young parents trying to live the American dream,\" said Vasquez Sura, who is a U.S. citizen, along with the couple's children.",
      "\"Our faith has grown, and I keep him in my prayers to bring him back home,\" she said.",
      "Strahan questioned Vasquez Sura about her filing for an order of protection from her husband in 2021, in which she cited being slapped, hit with an object, and being detained against her will. The case was closed about a month later when she failed to appear for a court hearing.",
      "\"You did take out a temporary order of protection against your husband in 2021. Were you in fear of your husband?\" Strahan asked.",
      "\"My husband is alive,\" Vasquez Sura responded. \"That's all I can say.\"",
      "Earlier this week, in a statement released to ABC News through her attorney, Vasquez Sura said, \"After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a protective order in case things escalated. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.\"",
      "Van Hollen, a Democratic senator from Vasquez Sura's home state of Maryland, flew to El Salvador on Wednesday to try to meet with Abrego Garcia.",
      "\"I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar. Tonight I had that chance,\" Van Hollen said in the social media post in which he shared the photo of him with Abrego Garcia. \"I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.\"",
      "Vasquez Sura was told that the meeting between Van Hollen and Abrego Garcia was set up by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, a source close to the family told ABC News.",
      "The source said Abrego Garcia and Vasquez Sura were not able to speak.",

    "story": [
      "The order does not rule in either way on the merits of  the inquiry.",
      "A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to further investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around two flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month.",
      "In a 2-1 ruling, with Obama-appointed judge Nina Pillard dissenting, the court put a temporary hold on Boasberg\u2019s determination finding probable cause the administration committed contempt of his March 15 oral and written rulings to turn the planes around, while ordering further disclosures from the government about which officials may have been directly involved.",
      "The order does not rule in either way on the merits of Boasberg\u2019s inquiry, however, and merely gives the petitioners in the case a deadline of April 23 by 5 p.m. to file their reply to the government. The government is then required to file their own reply by noon on April 25.",
      "In a ruling Wednesday, Boasberg found probable cause that the Trump administration acted in contempt of court when it defied his order to return the deportation flights to the U.S.",
      "As a remedy, Boasberg said the Trump administration must give each of the men removed under the Alien Enemies Act the right to challenge their detention through habeus proceedings or face the prospect of a criminal contempt case.",
      "If the administration failed to act, Boasberg said he would begin the process of identifying who acted in contempt through sworn declarations, depositions or live testimony. If needed, Boasberg would request a government attorney prosecute a criminal contempt case or appoint an independent attorney to pursue the case.",
      "The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision earlier this month, ruled that the Trump administration could resume deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the Alien Enemies Act, ultimately vacating Boasberg's initial order. But Boasberg concluded that, even if the order suffered from a \"legal defect,\" the Trump administration still defied the order during the three weeks it was in effect.",
      "\"The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders -- especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,\" he wrote. \"To permit such officials to freely 'annul the judgments of the courts of the United States' would not just 'destroy the rights acquired under those judgments'; it would make 'a solemn mockery' of 'the constitution itself.'\"",

      "VENICE, Italy -- Venice is charging day-trippers to the famed canal city an arrivals tax for the second year starting Friday, a measure to combat the overtourism that officials say is putting the city's UNESCO World Cultural Heritage status at risk.",
      "A UNESCO body decided against putting Venice on its list of cultural heritage sites deemed in danger after the tax was announced. But opponents of the day-tripper fee say it has done nothing to discourage visits.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Venice\u2019s battle with overtourism by the numbers:",
      "The tax charged to visitors who are not overnighting in Venice to enter its historic center during the second year of the day-tripper tax. Visitors who download a QR code at least three days in advance will pay 5 euros \u2014 the same amount charged last year throughout the pilot program. But those who make last-minute plans will pay double. The QR code is required from 8:30 a.m. until 4 p.m. and is checked at entry points to the city, including the Santa Lucia train station, the Piazzale Roma bus depot and near St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "The number of days this year that day visitors to Venice will be charged a fee to enter the historic center. They include mostly weekends and holidays from April 18 to July 27. That is up from 29 last year. The new calendar covers entire weeks over key holidays and extends the weekend period to include Fridays.",
      "The amount in euros that the city of Venice took in during a 2024 pilot program for the tax. The city's top budget official, Michele Zuin, said last year the running costs for the new system ran to 2.7 million euros, overshooting the total fees collected. This year, Zuin projects a surplus of about 1 million euros to 1.5 million euros, which will be used to offset the cost of trash collection and other services for residents.",
      "The number of day-trippers who paid the tax in 2024. Officials say 8,000 day-trippers paid in advance to enter the city on Friday, among the 77,000 who have already registered so far to enter the city this year. Another 117,000 have registered for exemptions, which apply to anyone born in Venice, those paying property taxes in the city, studying or working in the historic center, or living in the wider Veneto region, among others.",
      "The average number of daily visitors on the first 11 days of 2024 that Venice charged day-trippers. That's about 10,000 people more than the number of tourists recorded on each of the three important holidays during the previous year. City council member Giovanni Andrea Martini, an opponent of the measure, said the figures show the project has not deterred visitors.",
      "The number of official residents in Venice\u2019s historic center composed of over 100 islands connected by footbridges and traversed by its famed canals. The population peaked at 174,000 in 1951, when Venice was home to thriving industries. The number shrank during Italy's postwar economic boom as residents moved to the mainland for more modern housing \u2014 including indoor plumbing which was lacking in Venice. It has been shrinking dramatically over recent decades as local industry lost traction, families sought mainland conveniences and housing prices rose. Activists also blame the \u201cmono-culture\u201d of tourism, which they say has emptied the city of basic services like shops for everyday goods and medical care.",
      "The number of beds for tourists in Venice\u2019s historic center, including 12,627 in the less regulated short-term rental market, according to April data from the Ocio housing activist group. The number of tourist beds surpassed the number of permanent residents in 2023, according to Ocio's monitor. Anyone staying in a hotel within the city limits, including on the mainland districts of Mestre and Marghera, pays a lodging tax and is therefore exempt from the day-tripper tax.",
      "The number of annual arrivals of both day-trippers and overnight guests roughly confirmed by cellphone data tracked from a Smart Control Room since 2020, according to city officials.",

      "Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster off the Gulf Coast, the effects of the largest oil spill in U.S. history are still being felt",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Fifteen years after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded off the Gulf Coast, killing 11 and sending 134 million gallons (507.2 million liters) of crude gushing into the ocean, the effects of the nation's worst offshore oil spill are still being felt.",
      "Oil company BP paid billions of dollars in damages, propelling ambitious coastal restoration projects across five states. Yet cleanup workers and local residents who suffered health impacts they attribute to the oil spill have struggled to have their cases heard in court and few have received significant compensation.",
      "Conservation groups say the spill catalyzed innovative restoration work across the Gulf Coast, but are alarmed at the recent halt of a flagship land-creation project in Louisiana. As the Trump administration expands offshore oil and gas, they are concerned the best opportunities for rebuilding the Gulf Coast are slipping away.",
      "In the coastal community of Lafitte in southeast Louisiana, Tammy Gremillion is celebrating Easter Sunday, the anniversary of the April 20 spill, without her daughter. She remembers warning Jennifer against joining a cleanup crew tasked with containing the spill for BP.",
      "\"But I couldn\u2019t stop her \u2014 they were offering these kids lots of money,\u201d Gremillion said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know the dangers. They didn\u2019t do what they should have to protect these young people.\u201d",
      "Jennifer worked knee-deep in oil for months, returning home reeking of fumes, covered in black splotches and breaking out in rashes and suffering headaches. She also was exposed to Corexit, an EPA-approved chemical applied on and below the water to disperse oil, which has been linked to health problems.",
      "In 2020, Jennifer died of leukemia, a blood cancer that can be caused by exposure to oil.",
      "Gremillion, who broke down in tears as she recounted her daughter's death, is \u201c1,000% confident\u201d that exposure to toxins during the cleanup caused the cancer.",
      "She filed a lawsuit against BP in 2022, although the allegations have been difficult to establish in court. Gremillion's suit is one of a small number of cases still pending.",
      "An investigation by The Associated Press previously found all but a handful of roughly 4,800 lawsuits seeking compensation for health problems linked to the oil spill have been dismissed and only one has been settled.",
      "In a 2012 settlement, BP paid ill workers and coastal residents $67 million, but this amounted to no more than $1,300 each for nearly 80% of those seeking compensation.",
      "Attorneys from the Downs Law Group, representing Gremillion and around 100 others in cases against BP, say the company leveraged procedural technicalities to block victims from getting their day in court.",
      "BP declined to comment on pending litigation. In court filings, BP denied allegations that oil exposure caused health problems and attacked the credibility of medical experts brought by plaintiffs.",
      "The environmental impact was devastating, recalled PJ Hahn, who served on the frontlines as a southeast Louisiana coastal management official. He watched the oil eat away at barrier islands and marsh around his community in Plaquemines Parish until \u201cit would just crumble like a cookie in hot coffee, just break apart.\u201d",

Tens of thousands of seabirds and sea turtles were killed, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Since then, \u201csignificant progress\u201d has been made restoring Gulf habitats and ecosystems, according to The\u200b Natural Resource Damage Assessment Trustee Council, a group of state and federal agencies tasked with managing restoration funded by penalties levied against BP.",

      "Marijuana culture\u2019s high holiday known as 4/20 falls this year on Easter, as well as the last day of Passover",
      "Marijuana culture's high holiday, known as 4/20, falls this year on Easter Sunday, as well as the last day of Passover, meaning cannabis fans can celebrate in some unusual ways, including an \u201cEaster nug hunt\u201d in Los Angeles, kosher-style THC gummies in New York and a \u201cblaze and praise\u201d drag brunch in Portland, Oregon.",
      "\u201cIt seemed appropriate with egg prices today that we'd be searching for something else,\u201d said Brett Davis, who runs the marijuana tour company Weed Bus Los Angeles and organized the \u201cEaster nug hunt.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look at 4/20\u2019s history and how it's being celebrated this year:",
      "The origins of the date, and the term \u201c420\u201d generally, were long murky.",
      "Some claimed it referred to a police code for marijuana possession or was derived from Bob Dylan\u2019s \u201cRainy Day Women No. 12 & 35,\u201d with its refrain of \u201cEverybody must get stoned,\u201d 420 being the product of 12 times 35.",
      "But the prevailing explanation is that it started in the 1970s with a group of bell-bottomed buddies from San Rafael High School, in California\u2019s Marin County north of San Francisco, who called themselves \u201cthe Waldos.\u201d",
      "A friend\u2019s brother was afraid of getting busted for a patch of cannabis he was growing in the woods at nearby Point Reyes, so he drew a map and gave the teens permission to harvest the crop, the story goes.",
      "During fall 1971, at 4:20 p.m., just after classes and football practice, the group would meet up at the school\u2019s statue of chemist Louis Pasteur, smoke a joint and head out to search for the weed patch. They never did find it, but their private lexicon \u2014 \u201c420 Louie\u201d and later just \u201c420\u201d \u2014 would take on a life of its own.",
      "The Waldos saved postmarked letters and other artifacts from the 1970s referencing \u201c420,\u201d which they now keep in a bank vault, and when the Oxford English Dictionary added the term in 2017, it cited some of those documents as the earliest recorded uses.",
      "A brother of one of the Waldos was a close friend of Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh, as Lesh once confirmed in an interview with the Huffington Post, now HuffPost. The Waldos began hanging out in the band\u2019s circle, and the slang term spread.",
      "Fast-forward to the early 1990s: Steve Bloom, a reporter for the cannabis magazine High Times, was at a Dead show when he was handed a flyer urging people to \u201cmeet at 4:20 on 4/20 for 420-ing in Marin County at the Bolinas Ridge sunset spot on Mt. Tamalpais.\u201d High Times published it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon,\u201d one of the Waldos, Steve Capper, now 69, once told The Associated Press. \u201cMost things die within a couple years, but this just goes on and on. It\u2019s not like someday somebody\u2019s going to say, \u2018OK, Cannabis New Year\u2019s is on June 23rd now.\u2019\u201d",
      "While the Waldos came up with the term, the people who made the flier that was distributed at the Dead show \u2014 effectively turning 4/20 into a holiday \u2014 remain unknown.",
      "With weed, naturally.",
      "In New York City, the cannabis brand Tokin' Jew is advertising a kosher-style THC gummy line, \u201cTokin' Chews,\u201d designed to meet dietary restrictions for Passover.",
      "Davis said he expected 300 people to partake in the West Hollywood Easter nug scavenger hunt this weekend, aided by a mobile app leading them through participating dispensaries, trivia challenges and \u201cstoner activities.\u201d There is a $500 cash prize.",
      "In Portland, Bar Carlo is hosting the \u201cblaze and praise\u201d drag brunch. Cannabis consumption isn't allowed onsite \u2014 \"Please blaze before you arrive or go for a walk in the neighborhood in between performances,\" the event listing reads \u2014 but there will be a door-prize gift basket from a local dispensary.",
      "Bar owner Melinda Archuleta said the brunch is a dry run for hosting Pride month events in June. She herself doesn't care much for marijuana, but as a Mexican American who has been influenced by Catholicism, she is interested in seeing the two cultures melded \u201cin a cheeky way.\u201d",
      "\"I'm really looking forward to seeing how the queens do it,\" Archuleta said. \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously given them carte blanche to do whatever they want \u2014 it's 21 and up \u2014 so it doesn't matter if it's sacrilegious or borderline offensive.\"",
      "There are bigger celebrations, too, including the Mile High 420 Festival in Denver and one put on by SweetWater Brewing in Atlanta. Hippie Hill in San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Park historically has attracted massive crowds, but the gathering was canceled for a second straight year, with organizers citing a lack of financial sponsorship and city budget cuts.",
      "Just north of the Bay Area, Lagunitas Brewing in Petaluma, California, releases its \u201cWaldos\u2019 Special Ale\u201d every year on 4/20 in partnership with the term\u2019s coiners.",
      "4/20 also has become a big industry event, with vendors gathering to try each other\u2019s wares.",
      "There are 24 states that allow recreational marijuana and 14 others allowing it for medical purposes. But the movement recently has suffered some setbacks, with voters in Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota deciding not to adopt legalization measures last November.",
      "Several states also have cracked down on intoxicating products derived from hemp, which have been widely sold even in prohibition states thanks to a loophole in the federal Farm Bill.",
      "Marijuana remains illegal under federal law. As a candidate, President Donald Trump said he would vote for Florida\u2019s amendment and signaled support for reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a process started by the Biden administration.",
      "But his administration has not indicated cannabis policy is a priority. A fact sheet released by the White House last month complained that marijuana decriminalization in Washington, D.C., was an example of \u201cfailed policies\u201d that \u201copened the door to disorder.\u201d",
      "A bipartisan group of senators last week reintroduced legislation that would ensure states can adopt their own cannabis policies and remove certain financial hurdles for the industry, such as letting entities deduct business expenses on their taxes.",
      "Charles Alovisetti, a lawyer with the cannabis industry law firm Vicente LLP, said he hopes the administration will push forward with marijuana reform at the federal level, saying \u201cit does align with some of their policy objectives \u2014 namely reducing criminal activity, or cartel activity.\u201d",
      "He also encouraged advocates to keep pushing, noting some measures such as improving banking access for marijuana businesses might pass as part of larger legislative packages.",
      "\u201cYou continue speaking up, even if the political momentum isn't there,\u201d Alovisetti said. \u201cIt's only possible if you stay in everyone's ear.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Everglades is more than just swamps, fan boats and alligators and restoration efforts impact more than the land between Florida\u2019s east and west coasts",
      "ISLAMORADA, Fla. -- The Everglades is more than just swamps, fan boats and alligators and restoration efforts impact more than the land between Florida's east and west coasts.",
      "Florida Bay, a body of water located between the southern end of mainland Florida and the Florida Keys, makes up about a third of Everglades National Park.",
      "High salt levels during dry periods can have fatal consequences for the plants and animals living in the region, though experts are hopeful an early rain season this year will prevent a massive sea grass die-off like those experienced in the past.",
      "Steve Davis, chief science officer with The Everglades Foundation, called Florida Bay the estuary of the Everglades, which is actually a giant, slow-moving river starting around Orlando and running toward the southern end of the Florida peninsula.",
      "\u201cWhat that meant for Florida Bay was that during wet years, there\u2019s enough water getting into the bay to keep the salinities within that optimal salinity range,\" Davis said. \u201cBut when we run into an average-to-dry year or a drought year, it meant that salinity levels in the bay would get so high that it could be detrimental to the health of the seagrasses and the other species that depend on that habitat.\u201d",
      "Florida Bay doesn\u2019t have particularly strong tides, meaning water can sit in the bay for up to a year. When evaporating seawater isn't replaced by water from the Everglades, bay salinity levels can double normal ocean salinity, Davis explained.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s when we really run into some problems with the health of the habitats down here in the bay,\u201d he said.",
      "The last major sea grass die-off occurred in 2015. Xavier Figueredo, a recreational boat captain with Bay and Reef Company, said he was working in the area when the massive die-off hit about 40,000 acres (16,000 hectares).",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t see the water. All you see is dead grass floating on top,\u201d Figueredo said. \u201cAnd it smells like sulfur, like rotting eggs. As the die-off continued, more of the ecosystem was affected, the fish were affected.\u201d",
      "Even with more than 40% of Florida under drought conditions, Davis said he is not especially worried yet about another sea-grass die-off. Salt levels in the bay are already comparatively lower this year than they were in 2015.",
      "Davis said that is at least partially thanks to a massive project that elevated more than 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers) of the Tamiami Trail, a roadway built in 1928 that runs through the Everglades from Miami to Naples before heading north to Tampa.",
      "The route was essentially a giant dam preventing water from flowing south, but replacing the roadway with two long bridges, completed in 2013 and 2019, unblocked the so-called river of grass.",
      "\u201cMonths of inflow across Tamiami Trail have helped to moderate salinities,\" Davis said.",
      "The other significant advantage Florida Bay has this year compared to 2015 is the forecast of an early wet season rather than a delayed wet season, Davis said.",
      "While elevating Tamiami Trail already has created significant benefit for the Everglades and Florida Bay, scientists are counting on a massive restoration project, the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir, to address decades-old water problems throughout Florida.",
      "The $3.9 billion project will create a reservoir and wetland to store and clean polluted water from Lake Okeechobee in central Florida before it\u2019s discharged into the southern Everglades. This also should decrease the amount of polluted water being sent to Florida\u2019s east and west coasts.",
      "Davis called the Everglades Agricultural Area Reservoir \u201cthe game changer for freshwater flow restoration.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right now are just the benefits of the plumbing, the infrastructure that helps to get all that water into the park,\u201d he said. \"But once we\u2019re able to flow those larger volumes of water south, we\u2019re going to see system-wide improvement all the way down into Florida Bay.\u201d",
      "Everglades restoration is not only tied to Florida's ecological future but its economic future, said Paul Hindsley, the Everglades Foundation chief economist.",
      "\u201cFor every dollar of investment in restoration, we\u2019re receiving $4 in economic benefits,\" Hindsley said.",
      "Economic benefits include adding to the residential and industrial water supply, reducing extreme events from drought such as fires and reducing the risk of flooding from heavy precipitation, Hindsley said.",
      "The Everglades also provide over $5 billion a year in reduced risk for costs associated with National Flood Insurance Program claims. Meanwhile, South Florida\u2019s mangroves and reefs play an important role in reducing the impacts of storm surge.",
      "\u201cProtecting the environment is protecting the wealth of Floridians,\" Hindsley said.",

      "DALLAS -- The long-running criminal case against a Texas gunman who killed 23 people in a racist attack targeting Hispanic shoppers at a Walmart in El Paso in 2019 is on the verge of coming to a close.",
      "Patrick Crusius, 26, is expected to plead guilty Monday to capital murder and receive a sentence of life in prison with no possibility of parole for the massacre near the U.S.-Mexico border. El Paso County District Attorney James Montoya said last month he was offering Crusius a plea deal and that he wouldn't face the death penalty on the state charge.",
      "Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life sentences in federal court after pleading guilty in 2023 to hate crime and weapons charges. Under the Biden administration, federal prosecutors also took the death penalty off the table.",
      "Crusius is expected to serve his time in a state prison. Crusius initially was arrested by local authorities and will enter the custody of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice if he is sentenced on the state charges, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons said.",
      "Here's what to know about the deadly attack on Aug. 3, 2019, and its aftermath:",
      "Crusius was 21 years old when authorities say he drove for more than 10 hours from his home in suburban Dallas to El Paso and opened fire at the Walmart, which is popular with shoppers from Mexico and the U.S.",
      "Prosecutors have said Crusius was wearing earmuffs that muted the sound of gunfire when he began shooting people in the parking lot.",
      "He then moved inside the store and continued firing an AK-style rifle, cornering shoppers at a bank near the entrance where nine were killed before shooting at the checkout area and people in aisles.",
      "Exiting Walmart, he fired on a passing car, killing an elderly man and wounding his wife.",
      "Crusius was apprehended shortly after and confessed to officers who stopped him at an intersection, according to police.",
      "In a posting to an online message board just before the massacre, Crusius, a white, community-college dropout, said the shooting was \u201cin response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.\u201d He said Hispanics were going to take over the government and economy.",
      "On social media, he appeared consumed by the nation\u2019s immigration debate, tweeting #BuildtheWall and posts praising the hard-line border policies of Republican President Donald Trump, who was in his first term at the time.",
      "After the shooting, Crusius told officers that he had targeted Mexicans.",
      "Joe Spencer, one of Crusius\u2019 attorneys, on Thursday described Crusius as \u201can individual with a broken brain.\u201d Spencer said Crusius has been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, which can be marked by hallucinations, delusions and mood swings.",
      "The people who were killed ranged in age from a 15-year-old high school athlete to grandparents. They included immigrants and Mexican nationals who had crossed the U.S. border on routine shopping trips.",
      "They included Jordan Anchondo and Andre Anchondo, who were killed while shopping with their 2-month-old child, Paul, who survived. Authorities have said Jordan Anchondo shielded the baby from gunfire while her husband shielded them both.",
      "Guillermo \u201cMemo\u201d Garcia and his wife Jessica Coca Garcia were fundraising for their daughter's soccer team in the parking lot when they were both shot. She suffered leg wounds but recovered. He died from his injuries nearly nine months after the shooting, raising the death toll to 23.",
      "A week after the shooting, Coca Garcia rose from her wheelchair to give a speech across the road from the county jail where Crusius was being held.",
      "\u201cRacism is something I always wanted to think didn\u2019t exist,\" she said. \"Obviously, it does.\u201d",
      "Montoya said he decided to offer the plea deal because a majority of victims' relatives were eager for the case to be resolved. He acknowledged not all the families agreed.",
      "Montoya, a Democrat, said he supports the death penalty and believes Crusius deserves it, but the case might not have gone to trial until 2028 if his office had continued seeking the death penalty.",
      "When Montoya took office in January, he became the fourth district attorney to oversee the case in nearly six years. One of his predecessors resigned in 2022 under pressure over her handling of the case. He said the pandemic also caused delays.",
      "Stephanie Melendez, whose father, David Johnson, died shielding his wife and granddaughter, said she initially wanted Crusius to get the death penalty but as the case dragged on she wanted it to end.",
      "\u201cI just wanted it to be over,\" Melendez said. \"I was done reliving everything. I was done going to court for hours. I was done with the briefings that happened after that would last hours and it was just the same talk over and over again. We were just ready to be done with it all because, honestly, it\u2019s like reliving the trauma over and over again.\u201d",

      "Three former senior advisers to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are decrying what they called \u201cbaseless attacks\u201d after each was escorted from the Pentagon in an expanding probe on information leaks",
      "WASHINGTON -- Three former senior advisers to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth decried on Saturday what they called \u201cbaseless attacks\u201d after each was escorted from the Pentagon in an expanding probe on information leaks.",
      "Dan Caldwell, a Hegseth aide; Colin Carroll, chief of staff to Deputy Defense Secretary Stephen Feinberg; and Darin Selnick, Hegseth\u2019s deputy chief of staff were among four officials in Hegseth\u2019s inner circle who were ousted this past week.",
      "While the three initially had been placed on leave pending the investigation, a joint statement shared by Caldwell on X said the three were \u201cincredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended. Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of \u2018leaks\u2019 to begin with,\u201d the post said.",
      "Former Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot also announced he was resigning this week. The Pentagon said, however, that Ullyot was asked to resign.",
      "The upheaval comes less than 100 days into the Trump administration where the Pentagon has found itself frequently in the epicenter of controversial moves \u2014 from firings of senior military and civilian staff to broad edicts to purge content that promoted diversity, equity or inclusion. That led to images or other online content of heroes like the Tuskegee Airmen and Jackie Robinson being temporarily removed from the military's websites, causing public uproar.",
      "Last month, Hegseth announced that the Pentagon\u2019s intelligence and law enforcement arms were investigating what it says are leaks of national security information following reports that Elon Musk was set to receive a classified briefing on potential war plans with China.",
      "In the announcement by Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, the office warned that Defense Department personnel could face polygraphs in the probe.",
      "The departures also follow the firings of senior military officers, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. CQ Brown; Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti; National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command director Gen. Tim Haugh; and Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the U.S. military representative to the NATO Military Committee.",

      "\u201cWhile I believe strongly in respecting the democratic voting process and ballots will continue to be counted ... the results are clear that the people of Oakland have elected me as your next Mayor,\" she said. \"Thank you, Oakland!\"",

      "Lee was endorsed by former Gov. Jerry Brown and other previous Oakland mayors who said she was the seasoned, uniting presence the city needed after a divisive recall of former Mayor Sheng Thao in November. Thao was indicted on federal bribery, fraud and conspiracy charges in January.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sent California Highway Patrol officers to help combat what he called an alarming and unacceptable rise in crime. And the city doesn\u2019t have enough money to pay for public services.",
      "Despite her high name recognition, the race was surprisingly heated with Taylor, 47, a former Oakland city council member who pledged to bolster police, reduce crime and revitalize the city's economy.",
      "Taylor said in a statement that \u201cwhile the outcome was not what we worked for and hoped for,\u201d he was proud of the campaign and the bold ideas he introduced.",
      "On the campaign trail, Lee emphasized the need for more community services as well as more police. Economic development, job creation and ensuring core city services like fire hydrants work properly are among her priorities.",
      "She will finish out the remainder of Thao's term and would be up for reelection in November 2026.",
      "Lee was first elected to the U.S. House in 1998 and became best known nationally as the only lawmaker to vote against the 2001 authorization for the use of military force in response to the Sept. 11 attacks.",

      "The disparate events ranged from a march through midtown Manhattan and a rally in front of the White House to a demonstration at a Massachusetts commemoration marking the start of the American Revolutionary War 250 years ago. In San Francisco, protesters formed a human banner reading \u201cImpeach & Remove\u201d on the sands of Ocean Beach overlooking the Pacific Ocean.",
      "Thomas Bassford was among those who joined demonstrators at the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord outside of Boston. \u201cThe shot heard \u2019round the world\u201d on April 19, 1775, heralded the start of the nation\u2019s war for independence from Britain.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s defying the courts. He\u2019s kidnapping students. He\u2019s eviscerating the checks and balances,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThis is fascism.\u201d",
      "In Washington, Bob Fasick said he came out to the rally by the White House out of concern about threats to constitutionally protected due process rights, as well as Social Security and other federal safety-net programs.",

    "story": [
      "Ten years ago Saturday, Freddie Gray died from spinal injuries sustained during transport in a Baltimore police van and the city was thrust into a national debate over police brutality against Black Americans",
      "BALTIMORE -- It was almost instinctual for Ray Kelly to jump into action when he heard about a group of high school students clashing with police. He wanted to help protect the kids and de-escalate things, but instead, he watched his neighborhood burn.",
      "Unrest broke out after Freddie Gray died from spinal injuries sustained during transport in a police van in April 2015. The protesters stormed through majority-Black west Baltimore, setting police cars ablaze and looting businesses. They were fighting the generations of oppression experienced by Black Americans, from racist housing policies and crumbling schools to limited job opportunities, rampant gun violence and poor living conditions.",
      "A community activist from Gray\u2019s neighborhood, Kelly had focused on police accountability for years. As federal investigators launched a probe into the Baltimore Police Department and local prosecutors charged the officers involved, he doubled down in calling for stronger oversight at a time of growing national outrage over police brutality.",
      "Ten years later, his ongoing efforts illustrate Baltimore\u2019s progress \u2014 and lack thereof.",
      "Among the positive changes, Kelly said, there are more mechanisms to address police misconduct and hold officers accountable. Homicides and shootings are trending downward after a prolonged surge that began in the wake of Gray\u2019s death. And while west Baltimore still faces widespread poverty and neglect, he said, at least elected officials are paying more attention.",
      "\u201cPeople have to hear us out, because there is now this possibility that we can organize and elevate our voices,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI think Freddie Gray\u2019s death put that in motion.\u201d",
      "But progress is often painfully slow and woefully insufficient. Meanwhile city leaders face new obstacles from the Trump administration\u2019s escalating attacks on civil rights and diversity initiatives.",
      "For Gray\u2019s family, a decade has passed since their private loss played out on national news.",
      "Joined by the mayor and other dignitaries Saturday morning, his twin sister Fredricka laid a wreath of flowers near the site of his arrest, marking the anniversary of when he died in the hospital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still justice for Freddie Gray,\u201d she said, repeating what became a rallying cry in 2015. \u201cTen years now.\u201d",
      "Baltimore has a long history of mistreating its Black residents. In 1910, city leaders enacted the country\u2019s first residential segregation ordinance restricting African American homeowners to certain blocks.",
      "Kelly grew up during the height of the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and the national war on drugs, when police routinely conducted \u201cstreet sweeps\u201d or mass arrests in west Baltimore. When he started selling drugs to support himself during high school, the police were just another obstacle in an already uphill battle. He later struggled with addiction and served time in prison.",
      "After coming home in the early 2000s, Kelly started working with a neighborhood advocacy group to improve public safety. That put him in a unique position when the U.S. Department of Justice launched its probe of city police: Knowing residents would be wary about cooperating with federal investigators, Kelly helped make introductions and encouraged people to participate.",
      "\u201cIt was a gamble,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really what this community does.\u201d",
      "But the gamble paid off. The investigation uncovered longstanding patterns of excessive force, unlawful arrests and discriminatory policing practices, especially against Black people.",
      "The findings resulted in a 2017 consent decree mandating a series of reforms for the department, which promised to overhaul its policies and training.",
      "Since then, progress is inching along.",
      "The agency celebrated a milestone this week when a federal judge terminated two of the consent decree\u2019s 17 sections after finding full and sustained compliance \u2014 including with rules for transporting people in police vans. Gray was handcuffed, shackled and transported without a seatbelt as officers repeatedly ignored his calls for medical attention.",
      "Department leaders say large-scale change is happening, though not overnight. Officers have increased foot patrols, decreased low-level arrests and even undergone training on emotional regulation. They\u2019re less likely to use force when taking people into custody, and they\u2019ve contributed to historic reductions in homicides by partnering with service providers to address the root causes of gun violence.",
      "Police Commissioner Richard Worley said that over the course of his career, he\u2019s watched the culture of policing shift from \u201cwarriors to guardians.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, many Baltimore residents still don\u2019t trust the police to act with compassion and integrity. They don\u2019t believe the department has undergone a significant cultural change.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to take years and years to redefine the police department in the eyes of the community,\u201d U.S. District Judge James Bredar said during Thursday\u2019s consent decree hearing. \u201cThis work is critical, even if it doesn\u2019t bear fruit immediately.\u201d",
      "Gray, 25, was arrested near his home in west Baltimore\u2019s Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood, a once-thriving community that had fallen into disrepair.",
      "In its heyday, nearby Pennsylvania Avenue was a Black entertainment district with renowned jazz clubs, upscale shops and vibrant nightlife. Its cultural artifacts include the childhood home of Thurgood Marshall, the first African American appointed to the Supreme Court, and a bronze statue of jazz legend Billie Holiday, who also had roots in west Baltimore.",
      "A confluence of factors contributed to its decline, including urban flight and chronic disinvestment. Some businesses left after unrest following the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "Open-air drug markets moved in, and over-policing became a common complaint from residents. So when Gray was violently taken into custody after making eye contact with officers and running away, that longstanding frustration boiled over. Officials responded to the 2015 protests by bringing in the Maryland National Guard and imposing a citywide curfew.",
      "Many residents celebrated when prosecutors later announced criminal charges against the six officers involved, but none were convicted.",
      "In the meantime, political leaders visited Sandtown and pledged to invest in housing, youth programs and more. Those big promises have largely failed to materialize.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still the same damn place with the same damn issues,\u201d Kelly said, gazing down the street outside the former church rectory that houses his advocacy organization, the Citizens Policing Project. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of talk, but this is what we see.\u201d",
      "When the city closed the neighborhood\u2019s recreation center in 2021, Sandtown youth were basically left with nowhere to go, said 17-year-old Ryeheen Watson, whose childhood unfolded in the shadow of Gray\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cIt was like, nothing good comes for our community,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you\u2019re starting as an underdog, there\u2019s nowhere to go but up.\u201d",
      "The second Trump administration will likely create even more challenges for communities like Sandtown as the White House slashes federal initiatives aimed at advancing racial equity.",
      "Baltimore attorney Billy Murphy, who represented the Gray family, said that while Black people continue fighting for their collective future, a resurgence of white supremacism is infecting national politics.",
      "\u201cWhere are we today? That\u2019s where we are,\u201d Murphy said at a recent event commemorating Gray\u2019s death. \u201cWe are heading backwards.\u201d",
      "But at least on the local level, political discourse now includes more progressive Black voices, said Dayvon Love, director of public policy for the grassroots think tank Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle. In his view, Gray\u2019s death was a turning point.",
      "\u201cThat has advanced our ability to advocate unapologetically for Black people in ways that before the uprising were shut out,\u201d Love said.",
      "Mayor Brandon Scott says his administration is achieving long-awaited progress by investing in historically neglected neighborhoods, including a $15 million plan to renovate Sandtown\u2019s recreation center and upgrades to Gilmor Homes, the public housing complex where Gray was arrested.",
      "However, Scott said in an interview, \u201cWe\u2019re not celebrating here, because the work is not complete.\u201d",
      "For Kelly, discussions of politics and progress often miss the point by failing to acknowledge Gray himself, the young man from west Baltimore who died after a tragic encounter with police a decade ago.",
      "Instead of marking the anniversary of his death, Kelly suggested, perhaps it\u2019s his birthday that should be celebrated: Aug. 16, 1989.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Campus mentors. Move-in events. Scholarships. Diversity offices that made them feel welcome on predominantly white campuses.",
      "As U.S. colleges pull back on diversity, equity and inclusion practices, students of color say they are starting to lose all of these things and more.",
      "The full scope of campus DEI rollbacks is still emerging as colleges respond to the Trump administration\u2019s orders against diversity practices. But students at some schools said early cuts are chipping away at the sense of community that helped open the door to higher education.",
      "\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re going back. I don\u2019t know how else to describe it,\u201d said Breeana-Iris Rosario, a junior at the University of Michigan, which is closing its DEI office and scrapping a campus-wide inclusion plan. \u201cIt\u2019s like our voices aren\u2019t being heard.\u201d",
      "The retreat from DEI has been building for years, driven by Republican-led states that have ordered public colleges to close DEI offices and eliminate programs. But it has accelerated under President Donald Trump and his threats to cut federal funding.",
      "Trump's administration escalated the battle when it suggested in a letter to Harvard University that the school should lose its nonprofit status for defying federal orders, including a demand to eliminate DEI \u201cto the satisfaction of the federal government.\u201d",
      "At Michigan, students have been told the casualties include orientation events for new Latino, Arab and Asian American students, along with the LEAD Scholars program, a financial aid award for Black, Latino and Native American students.",
      "Coming from a low-income part of Detroit, Rosario said winning the scholarship cemented her decision to attend Michigan. She later met some of her best friends at a move-in event for Latino students called Alma. Losing those programs, she fears, could reinforce a sense of isolation among Hispanic students, who make up 6% of the school's undergraduates.",
      "\u201cIt would be hard to find my community if I didn\u2019t have access to these resources,\" she said.",
      "A February memo from the Education Department directed schools and colleges to eliminate race from any decision-making around hiring, admissions, housing, financial aid and student life. It warned violators could lose access to federal money.",
      "Dozens of universities have since come under investigation, all while the Trump administration freezes billions of dollars at Harvard and other colleges accused of defying orders on campus antisemitism and transgender athletes.",
      "Michigan was among the first to make major DEI rollbacks, and others have followed to avoid federal scrutiny. Others have rebranded DEI offices and scrubbed the term from websites, and others still are standing firm in support of DEI.",
      "At Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, officials cited the federal orders when they moved to close the campus DEI office last month.",
      "\u201cIt is clear we must be in compliance with them to receive the federal funding that is critical to our present and future,\u201d said Eric Kaler, Case\u2019s president, in a campus message.",
      "Kaler said the office will be replaced by an Office for Campus Enrichment and Engagement, though it\u2019s unclear what that will entail. The private university receives about $250 million a year in federal research funding, 16% of its total revenue, according to university data.",
      "Justen Pippens said the DEI office was like a second home on campus. The junior called it a \u201cstress-free zone\u201d where he could get personal and academic guidance. He grew so close with one staff member that he came to know her as Auntie. He said it\u2019s unclear whether those employees will have jobs at the new office.",
      "Case also is halting its Envision Weekend, an orientation event for underrepresented students. Pippens said it\u2019s a setback for him and other Black students, who make up just 6% of undergraduates at Case.",
      "\u201cNow,\" he said, \u201cwe no longer have our central support systems on campus.\u201d",
      "In Virginia, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin celebrated when the University of Virginia\u2019s governing board voted to end DEI programs in March.",
      "\u201cDEI is done at the University of Virginia,\u201d Youngkin said in a statement, calling it a shift toward \u201cmerit-based opportunity.\u201d",
      "Tyler English, a senior at UVA, said students have been told scholarships and graduate programs focused on minority students are being scaled back or eliminated. Among other changes, a student group called Men of Color, Honor and Ambition is replacing the word \u201ccolor\u201d with \u201ccharacter,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor a portion of us, we now question whether our identities and voices are truly valued in this space,\u201d said English, a member of the campus\u2019 Black Student Alliance.",
      "University spokesperson Brian Coy wouldn't provide details on DEI rollbacks and said he couldn't confirm changes to scholarships.",
      "The government\u2019s anti-DEI campaign is being challenged in court by opponents who say it offers little clarity on exactly which practices are outlawed, leaving schools to weed out anything that could be construed as DEI.",
      "As a result of the vague directives, \"those who are advocating against this work are getting a higher return on their investment than they should,\u201d said Paulette Granberry Russell, president of the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education.",
      "Yet opponents are pressing the White House to go further. Christopher Rufo, a conservative strategist who has fought DEI, said the government should root out DEI using tools that forced desegregation during the Civil Rights Movement.",
      "\u201cDEI is a violation of the Civil Rights Act,\u201d Rufo said on X. \u201cAny publicly funded institution that continues to practice DEI should face a federal investigation, consent decree, termination of funds, and loss of nonprofit status. If that doesn\u2019t work, send in the 101st Airborne.\u201d",
      "In Michigan, the rollbacks are targeting programs that aimed to preserve racial diversity after the state banned affirmative action in 2006, including the LEAD program.",
      "University of Michigan officials declined to discuss changes, but a campus message from President Santa Ono said the school will find other ways to support students, including an expansion of scholarships for low-income students.",
      "Rosario and other LEAD scholarship winners received an email saying there would be \u201cno adverse financial impact\u201d to their financial aid, with no further explanation.",
      "Rosario doesn\u2019t entirely blame the university for the cuts, but she wonders why Michigan moved quickly to make changes while some colleges held firm. The first in her family to attend college, she fears what it means for the next generation of students.",
      "\u201cThey've taken away our sense of community,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just makes it that much harder for people of color to feel comfortable pursuing higher education.\u201d",

      "At least $1.6 million in federal funds for projects meant to capture and digitize stories of the systemic abuse of generations of Indigenous children in boarding schools at the hands of the U.S. government have been slashed due to federal funding cuts under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "The cuts are just a fraction of the grants canceled by the National Endowment for the Humanities in recent weeks as part of the Trump administration\u2019s deep cost-cutting effort across the federal government. But coming on the heels of a major federal boarding school investigation by the previous administration and an apology by then-President Joe Biden, they illustrate a seismic shift.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re looking to \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019 then I think it should start with the truth about the true American history,\u201d said Deborah Parker, CEO of the National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition.",
      "The coalition lost more than $282,000 as a result of the cuts, halting its work to digitize more than 100,000 pages of boarding school records for its database. Parker, a citizen of the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state, said Native Americans nationwide depend on the site to find loved ones who were taken or sent to these boarding schools.",
      "Searching that database last year, Roberta \u201cBirdie\u201d Sam, a member of Tlingit & Haida, was able to confirm that her grandmother had been at a boarding school in Alaska. She also discovered that around a dozen cousins, aunts and uncles had also been at a boarding school in Oregon, including one who died there. She said the knowledge has helped her with healing.",
      "\u201cI understand why our relationship has been the way it has been. And that\u2019s been a great relief for myself,\" she said. \"I\u2019ve spent a lot of years very disconnected from my family, wondering what happened. And now I know \u2014 some of it anyways.\u201d",
      "An April 2 letter to the healing coalition that was signed by Michael McDonald, acting chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, says the \u201cgrant no longer effectuates the agency\u2019s needs and priorities.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press left messages by phone and email for the National Endowment for the Humanities. White House officials and the Office of Management and Budget also did not respond Friday to an email requesting comment.",
      "For 150 years the U.S. removed Indigenous children from their homes and sent them away to the schools, where they were stripped of their cultures, histories and religions, and beaten for speaking their native languages.",
      "At least 973 Native American children died at government-funded boarding schools, according to an Interior Department investigation launched by former Interior Secretary Deb Haaland. Both the report and independent researchers say the actual number was much higher.",
      "The forced assimilation policy officially ended with the enactment of the Indian Child Welfare Act in 1978. But the government never fully investigated the boarding school system until the Biden administration.",
      "In October, Biden apologized for the government's creation of the schools and the policies that supported them.",
      "Haaland, a Laguna Pueblo citizen who's running for governor in New Mexico, described the recent cuts as the latest step in the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cpattern of hiding the full story of our country.\u201d But she said they can't erase the extensive work already done.",
      "\u201cThey cannot undo the healing communities felt as they told their stories at our events to hear from survivors and descendants,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThey cannot undo the investigation that brings this dark chapter of our history to light. They cannot undo the relief Native people felt when President Biden apologized on behalf of the United States.\u201d",
      "Among the grants terminated earlier this month was $30,000 for a project between the Koahnic Broadcast Corporation and Alaska Native Heritage Center to record and broadcast oral histories of elders in Alaska. Koahnic received an identical letter from McDonald.",
      "Benjamin Jacuk, the Alaska Native Heritage Center\u2019s director of Indigenous research, said the news came around the same time they lost about $100,000 through a Institute of Museum and Library Services grant for curating a boarding school exhibit.",
      "\u201cThis is a story that for all of us, we weren\u2019t able to really hear because it was so painful or for multitudes of reasons,\u201d said Jacuk, a citizen of Kenaitze Indian Tribe. \"And so it\u2019s really important right now to be able to record these stories that our elders at this point are really opening up to being able to tell.\u201d",
      "Former Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs Bryan Newland described the cuts as frustrating, especially given the size of the grants.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not even a drop in the ocean when it comes to the federal budget,\u201d said Newland, a citizen of the Bay Mills Indian Community (Ojibwe). \u201cAnd so it\u2019s hard to argue that this is something that\u2019s really promoting government efficiency or saving taxpayer funds.\u201d",
      "In April 2024, the National Endowment for the Humanities announced that it was awarding $411,000 to more than a dozen tribal nations and organizations working to illustrate the impact of these boarding schools. More than half of those awards have since been terminated.",
      "The grant cuts were documented by the non-profit organization National Humanities Alliance.",
      "John Campbell, a member of Tlingit and the Tulalip Tribes, said the coalition's database helped him better understand his parents, who were both boarding school survivors and \u201cpassed on that tradition of being traumatized.\u201d",
      "When he was growing up, his mother used to put soap in his mouth when he said a bad word. He said he learned through the site that she experienced that punishment beginning when she was 6-years-old in a boarding school in Washington state when she would speak her language.",
      "\u201cShe didn\u2019t talk about it that much,\" he said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want to talk about it either. It was too traumatic.\u201d",

      "With five distinctively-themed sections and a 500-room hotel, the multibillion-dollar Universal Epic Universe is slated to open to the public on May 22, just in time for the start of summer, when the Orlando area's theme parks are usually jammed with families and young park-goers fresh out of school.",
      "It's the first major, traditional theme park to open in Florida since 1999, when Universal Islands of Adventure debuted, though Universal opened a themed Orlando water park, Volcano Bay, in 2017. The addition of Epic Universe brings the total number of parks at the Florida resort to four, including Universal Studios.",
      "The opening also raises the stakes in Universal's competition with crosstown rival Walt Disney World for a greater share of Orlando's annual influx of 74 million tourists.",
      "Universal officials also describe Epic Universe as the company's most technologically advanced theme park. For example, it uses a facial recognition system for ride express lines.",
      "Universal's owner, Comcast NBCUniversal, also announced plans this month for its first Universal-branded theme park and resort in Europe, at a location north of London. A year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas should open later this year and a family-oriented theme park is slated to open next year in a Dallas suburb.",

      "The astronomically-themed section is the only one with original characters not based on pre-existing intellectual property. Centered around a football field-sized water fountain and filled with abundant, colorful flowers, it's an oasis of calm between the sensory overload of the four sections.",
      "That's not to say excitement can't be found in Celestial Park, which is home to a 133-foot (40.5-meter) high dual launching roller coaster, Stardust Racers, and an enormous carousel.",
      "Super Nintendo World is the definition of sensory overload, from its bright primary colors that scream \u201cLook at me!\u201d to the loudness of the steel-drum-thumping syncopated calypso music.",
      "It has two levels \u2014 rare for theme parks \u2014 and creates a completely immersive experience since nothing outside Super Nintendo World can be seen beyond the towering walls of Peach's Castle and Mt. Beanpole. There is an augmented reality dark ride, a kid-friendly, slow-moving omni-mover ride and a Donkey Kong-themed coaster. Character performers dressed as Mario and Luigi greet members of the crowd in a roped-off area.",
      "Dark Universe is a throwback to Frankenstein's monster, Dracula and the Invisible Man movies that launched Universal's career in horror franchises.",

There is a dark ride through Frankenstein's castle, a family-friendly coaster based on the werewolf legend and a tavern topped by a windmill with blades engulfed by flames every few minutes.",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- Thirty years after the deadliest homegrown attack in U.S. history, former President Bill Clinton returned to Oklahoma City on Saturday to remember the people who were killed and comfort those affected by the bombing.",
      "Clinton was president on April 19, 1995, when a truck bomb exploded, destroying a nine-story federal building in downtown Oklahoma City. He delivered the keynote address at a remembrance ceremony near the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum.",
      "Clinton, now 78, was widely praised for how he helped the city grapple with its grief in the wake of the bombing, which killed 168 people, including 19 children. He says it was a day in his presidency that he will never forget.",
      "\u201cI still remember as if it were 30 minutes ago, coming here with Hillary to that memorial service and saying: \u2018You have lost too much, but you have not lost everything. You have certainly not lost America, and we will be with you for as many tomorrows as it takes,\u2019\u201d Clinton said, recalling his first visit to Oklahoma City just days after the bombing, when he spoke at a memorial service for the for the victims. \u201cI do think we've kept that commitment.\u201d",
      "Clinton has visited the Oklahoma City National Memorial Museum numerous times in the years since the bombing and delivered speeches on major anniversaries.",
      "On Saturday, Clinton also cautioned about the polarizing nature of modern-day politics and how such divisiveness can lead to violence, as it did 30 years ago. He said there is much the nation can learn from the \u201cOklahoma Standard,\u201d a term coined to reference the city's response to the bombing by uniting in service, honor and kindness.",
      "\u201cToday, Oklahoma City, America needs you,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish to goodness every American could just see life unfold here, hearing these stories.\u201d",
      "Other speakers included former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating and former Oklahoma City Mayor Ron Norick, who were in office when the bombing occurred. Family members of some of those killed in the bombing read the 168 names of those killed in the attack.",
      "Saturday's ceremony was originally scheduled to take place on the grounds of the memorial but was moved inside an adjacent church because of heavy rains.",
      "After the ceremony, a procession of bagpipe players from the Oklahoma City Fire Department led many of those in attendance across the street to the outdoor memorial built on the grounds where the federal building once stood. The memorial includes a museum, a reflecting pool and 168 empty chairs of glass, bronze and stone etched with the names of those killed. Nineteen of the chairs are smaller than the others to represent the children killed.",
      "Among the memorial's top missions is to help people understand the senselessness of political violence and teach a new generation about the impact of the bombing, said Kari Watkins, the memorial's president and CEO.",
      "\u201cWe knew when we built this place we would some day reach a generation of people who weren't born or who didn't remember the story,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI think now, not just kids are coming through more and more, but teachers who are teaching those kids.\u201d",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Amid the abandoned chemistry notes and other debris left behind after a deadly shooting at Florida State University are lingering questions about how the stepson of a beloved sheriff\u2019s deputy tasked with school safety at a middle school became the accused gunman.",
      "Political science student Phoenix Ikner was a long-standing member of a sheriff\u2019s office youth advisory council and was steeped in the family-like culture of the agency. When officers rushed to the university\u2019s student union on reports of gunfire, authorities say it was the 20-year-old who used his stepmother\u2019s former service weapon to open fire, killing two men and wounding six others.",
      "As people fled in terror, Ikner was shot and taken into custody. He invoked his right not to speak to investigators, and his motive remains unknown as he lies in a hospital bed.",
      "The prosecutor's office is weighing possible charges as stories emerge about a darker side. One classmate recalled him being kicked out of a student club over comments that other members found troubling.",
      "\u201cThis is horrific,\u201d Jimmy Williams, the chief of safety for Leon County Schools, said of the shooting. \u201cThis is a horrible, horrible event.\u201d",
      "Williams, who has known Ikner\u2019s stepmother, Jessica Ikner, for a decade, said the allegations underscore that \u201cnone of us are immune to tragedy.\u201d",
      "His stepmother, whose own alma mater is Florida State, was reassigned from her position as a school resource officer Friday and granted the personal leave she requested, a sheriff\u2019s office spokesperson told The Associated Press.",
      "When the alert went out of an active shooter at Florida State University, Jessica Ikner was on duty around 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) away at Raa Middle School. A sheriff\u2019s office spokesperson said Jessica Ikner worked to secure the campus to prevent anyone from entering as Raa went into \u201clockout mode,\" along with all of the county\u2019s public schools. She was practiced at this work.",
      "Last year, she was named an \u201cemployee of the month\u201d by the sheriff\u2019s office, where she has worked for 18 years.",
      "Police said they believed Phoenix Ikner shot the victims using his stepmother\u2019s former service handgun, which she had kept for personal use after the force upgraded its weapons.",
      "Leon County Sheriff Walter McNeil described Phoenix Ikner on Thursday as having been \u201csteeped in the Leon County Sheriff\u2019s Office family\u201d and engaged in a number of sheriff\u2019s office training programs, adding that it wasn\u2019t a surprise that he would have access to guns.",
      "There was no record of him having a criminal record. And in Florida, training and a background check are not required to carry concealed guns in public.",
      "When Ikner was a child, his parents were involved in several custody disputes with his biological mother, court records show.",
      "In 2015, when he was 10, his biological mother, Anne-Mari Eriksen, said she was taking him to South Florida for spring break in 2015 but instead traveled to Norway. After returning to the U.S., she pleaded no contest to removing a minor from the state against a court order and was sentenced to 200 days in jail. She later moved to vacate her plea, but that was denied.",
      "In the fall of that same year, Eriksen filed a civil libel-slander complaint against Jessica Ikner, along with several other family members. The complaint, which was later dismissed, accused them of harassing Eriksen and abusing Ikner\u2019s position at the sheriff\u2019s office.",
      "In 2020, at age 15, the suspect received court approval to change his name from Christian Eriksen to Phoenix Ikner, court documents show. His old name was a constant reminder of a \u201ctragedy\u201d he suffered, in the words of administrative magistrate James Banks, who approved the request, NBC News reported.",
      "Banks observed that Ikner was a \u201cmentally, emotionally and physically mature young adult who is very articulate\u201d and \u201cvery polite\u201d said he chose the new name as a representation of \u201crising from the ashes anew.\u201d",
      "Reid Seybold and his classmates were working on a group project in a building located a short, three-minute walk from the student union when someone ran in and warned them about the gunfire. They huddled together, the 22-year-old said, frantically firing off what they thought might be their final text messages to loved ones.",
      "When Seybold found out who the suspect in the shooting was \u2014 that it was someone he knows \u2014 he was overcome with anger. Seybold was the president of a club that Phoenix Ikner joined when they were both studying at the local community college, now called Tallahassee State College.",
      "Seybold said Ikner was known for espousing racist and white supremacist views that so alienated other members that the club asked him to leave the group.",
      "\u201cHe made people that uncomfortable,\u201d said Seybold, who now also is studying political science at Florida State. \u201cI personally know him to have complained about how multiculturalism and communism are ruining America.\u201d",
      "Ikner transferred to Florida State after earning an associate degree at the community college, school officials said.",
      "He didn't attract the attention of the school paper, other than commenting in a FSU story about a rally on campus against President Donald Trump.",
      "Ikner, a registered Republican, described the protesters as \u201centertaining\u201d because Trump was already set to be inaugurated. The comments have since been removed from the story, an editor's note saying the move was to \u201cavoid amplifying the voice of an individual responsible for violence.\u201d",
      "Before Ikner\u2019s Instagram was taken down, his bio quoted a verse from the Old Testament book of Jeremiah. \u201cThou art my battle ax and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms,\u201d reads Jeremiah 51:20, which scholars have interpreted to depict God\u2019s judgment on Babylon. The empire is a symbol in the Bible of sinfulness and immorality.",
      "A Tallahassee Police Department patrol car was stationed Thursday evening near the street where the family lives, blocking reporters from approaching the family\u2019s home in a well-kept suburban neighborhood on the city\u2019s east side.",
      "Phone messages left for Jessica Ikner at a number listed for her on a school resource website and another phone connected to her through public records were not immediately returned Friday. And a sheriff\u2019s office spokeswoman said she is not aware of the family putting out a statement or having a family spokesperson.",
      "The only insight comes from the past statements. Nearly a decade ago, Jessica Ikner wrote a story posted on the Tallahassee Family Magazine website about children\u2019s safety while surfing the internet, including tips to strengthen family bonds.",

      "Let the arguments begin",
      "NEW YORK -- The American Revolution began 250 years ago, in a blast of gunshot and a trail of colonial spin.",
      "Starting with Saturday's anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the country will look back to its war of independence and ask where its legacy stands today.",
      "The semiquincentennial comes as President Donald Trump, the scholarly community and others divide over whether to have a yearlong party leading up to July 4, 2026, as Trump has called for, or to balance any celebrations with questions about women, the enslaved and Indigenous people and what their stories reveal.",
      "The history of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts is half-known, the myth deeply rooted.",
      "Reenactors may with confidence tell us that hundreds of British troops marched from Boston in the early morning of April 19, 1775, and gathered about 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) northwest on Lexington's town green.",
      "Firsthand witnesses remembered some British officers yelled, \u201cThrown down your arms, ye villains, ye rebels!\u201d and that amid the chaos a shot was heard, followed by \u201cscattered fire\u201d from the British. The battle turned so fierce that the area reeked of burning powder. By day's end, the fighting had continued around 7 miles (11 kilometers) west to Concord and some 250 British and 95 colonists were killed or wounded.",
      "But no one has learned who fired first, or why. And the revolution itself was initially less a revolution than a demand for better terms.",
      "Woody Holton, a professor of early American history at the University of South Carolina, says most scholars agree the rebels of April 1775 weren\u2019t looking to leave the empire, but to repair their relationship with King George III and go back to the days preceding the Stamp Act, the Tea Act and other disputes of the previous decade.",
      "\u201cThe colonists only wanted to turn back the clock to 1763,\u201d he said.",
      "Stacy Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize winning historian whose books include biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Samuel Adams, said Lexington and Concord \u201cgalvanized opinion precisely as the Massachusetts men hoped it would, though still it would be a long road to a vote for independence, which Adams felt should have been declared on 20 April 1775.\u201d",
      "But at the time, Schiff added, \u201cIt did not seem possible that a mother country and her colony had actually come to blows.\u201d",
      "The rebels had already believed their cause greater than a disagreement between subjects and rulers. Well before the turning points of 1776, before the Declaration of Independence or Thomas Paine\u2019s boast that \u201cWe have it in our power to begin the world over again,\u201d they cast themselves in a drama for the ages.",
      "The so-called Suffolk Resolves of 1774, drafted by civic leaders of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, prayed for a life \u201cunfettered by power, unclogged with shackles,\u201d a fight that would determine the \u201cfate of this new world, and of unborn millions.\u201d",
      "The revolution was an ongoing story of surprise and improvisation. Military historian Rick Atkinson, whose \u201cThe Fate of the Day\u201d is the second of a planned trilogy on the war, called Lexington and Concord \u201ca clear win for the home team,\u201d if only because the British hadn't expected such impassioned resistance from the colony's militia.",
      "The British, ever underestimating those whom King George regarded as a \u201cdeluded and unhappy multitude,\u201d would be knocked back again when the rebels promptly framed and transmitted a narrative blaming the royal forces.",
      "\u201cOnce shots were fired in Lexington, Samuel Adams and Joseph Warren did all in their power to collect statements from witnesses and to circulate them quickly; it was essential that the colonies, and the world, understand who had fired first,\u201d Schiff said. \"Adams was convinced that the Lexington skirmish would be \u2018famed in the history of this country.' He knocked himself out to make clear who the aggressors had been.\u201d",
      "Neither side imagined a war lasting eight years, or had confidence in what kind of country would be born out of it. The founders united in their quest for self-government but differed how to actually govern, and whether self-government could even last.",
      "Americans have never stopped debating the balance of powers, the rules of enfranchisement or how widely to apply the exhortation, \u201cAll men are created equal.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it's important to remember that the language of the founders was aspirational. The idea that it was self-evident all men were created equal was preposterous at a time when hundreds of thousands were enslaved,\" said Atkinson, who cites the 20th-century poet Archibald MacLeish's contention that \u201cdemocracy is never a thing done.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't think the founders had any sense of a country that some day would have 330 million people,\" Atkinson said. \u201cOur country is an unfinished project and likely always will be.\u201d",

      "Here's a look at Trump's evolution on the way he talks about the Russia-Ukraine war:",

But I don\u2019t want to tell you what it is because then I can\u2019t use that negotiation; it\u2019ll never work,\u201d Trump told Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity, claiming that he could \u201csolve\u201d the war \u201cin 24 hours\u201d if he were back in the White House.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s a very easy negotiation to take place. I will have it solved within one day, a peace between them,\" Trump said of the war, which at that point had been ongoing for more than a year since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

      "JULY 2024: When asked to respond to Trump's one-day claim, Russia\u2019s United Nations Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters that \u201cthe Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\u201d Afterward, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said that \u201ca top priority in his second term will be to quickly negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war.\"",
      "AUGUST 2024: \u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\u201d Trump told a National Guard Conference. \u201cI\u2019ll get it settled very fast. I don\u2019t want you guys going over there. I don\u2019t want you going over there.\u201d",

      "JAN. 8, 2025: In a Fox News Channel interview, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg \u2014 now serving as Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia \u2014 proposed a 100-day deadline to end the war. Friday marked 100 days since that interview. The 100th day of Trump's presidency is April 30.",
      "JAN. 31: Trump says his new administration has already had \u201cvery serious\u201d discussions with Russia and says he and Putin could soon take \u201csignificant\u201d action toward ending the grinding conflict.",
      "\u201cWe will be speaking, and I think will perhaps do something that\u2019ll be significant,\u201d Trump said in an exchange with reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cWe want to end that war. That war would have not started if I was president.\u201d",
      "FEB. 12: Trump and Putin speak for more than an hour and Trump speaks afterward with Zelenskyy. Trump says afterward, \u201cI think we\u2019re on the way to getting peace.\u201d",
      "FEB. 19: Trump posts on his Truth Social site that Zelenskyy is serving as a \u201cdictator without elections.\u201d He adds that \u201cwe are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only \u2018TRUMP,\u2019 and the Trump Administration, can do.\u201d",

      "In a March 18 call, Putin told Trump that he would agree not to target Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure but refused to back a full 30-day ceasefire that Trump had proposed. Afterward, Trump on social media heralded that move, which he said came \u201cwith an understanding that we will be working quickly to have a Complete Ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible War between Russia and Ukraine.\u201d",
      "In their own call a day later, Trump suggested that Zelenskyy should consider giving the U.S. ownership of Ukraine\u2019s power plants to ensure their long-term security. Trump told Zelenskyy that the U.S could be \u201cvery helpful in running those plants with its electricity and utility expertise,\u201d according to a White House statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz.",

      "He spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested it could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.",
      "\u201cWe are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\u201d Rubio told reporters. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s not, then I think we\u2019re just going to move on. It\u2019s not our war. We have other priorities to focus on.\u201d",
      "He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \u201cin a matter of days.\u201d",
      "Later that day, Trump told reporters at the White House that he agreed with Rubio that a Ukraine peace deal must be done \u201cquickly.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have no specific number of days but quickly. We want to get it done,\u201d he said.",
      "Saying \u201cMarco is right\u201d that the dynamic of the negotiations must change, Trump stopped short of saying he\u2019s ready to walk away from peace negotiations.",

      "Iran and the United States are preparing for a second round of negotiations over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program in Rome",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Iran and the United States prepared Saturday for a second round of negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program in Rome",
      "The talks in Italy over Easter weekend again will hinge on U.S. billionaire Steve Witkoff, the U.S. Mideast envoy of President Donald Trump, and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Whether the two men find common ground in the high-stakes negotiations could mean success or failure in the talks.",
      "That talks are even happening represent a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and U.S. Embassy hostage crisis. Trump in his first term unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, setting off years of attacks and negotiations that failed to restore the accord that drastically limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon. Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East have spiked over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip and after U.S. airstrikes on targeting Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi rebels killed more than 70 people and wounded dozens more.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,\u201d Trump said Friday. \u201cI want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.\u201d",
      "Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei wrote Saturday on the social platform X that Iran \u201calways demonstrated, with good faith and a sense of responsibility, its commitment to diplomacy as a civilized way to resolve issues.\"",
      "\u201cWe are aware that it is not a smooth path but we take every step with open eyes, relying also on the past experiences,\u201d he added.",
      "Both men have been traveling in recent days. Witkoff had been in Paris for talks about Ukraine as Russia's full-scale war there grinds on. Araghchi will be coming from Tehran, Iran, after a visit to Moscow where he met with officials including Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Russia, a member of the world powers involved in Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal, could be a key participant in any future deal reached between Tehran and Washington. Analysts suggest Moscow could potentially take custody of Iran's uranium enriched to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who mediated the first round, already has arrived in Rome and met with his Italian counterpart on Friday. Baghaei said al-Busaidi again mediate between the countries.",
      "Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula, has long served as an interlocutor between Iran and the West. Muscat hosted the first round of negotiations between Araghchi and Witkoff last weekend, which saw the two men meet face to face after indirect talks.",
      "Iran's internal politics are still inflamed over the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, with women still ignoring the law on the streets of Tehran. Rumors also persist over the government potentially increasing the cost of subsidized gasoline in the country, which has sparked nationwide protests in the past",
      "Iran's rial currency plunged to over 1 million to a U.S. dollar earlier this month. The currency has improved with the talks, however, something Tehran hopes will continue.",
      "Meanwhile, two used Airbus A330-200 long sought by Iran's flag carrier, Iran Air, arrived to Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport on Thursday, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed. The planes, formerly of China's Hainan Airlines, had been in Muscat and re-registered to Iran.",
      "The aircraft had Rolls-Royce engines, which include significant American parts and servicing. Such a transaction would need approval from the U.S. Treasury given sanctions on Iran. The State Department and Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs has vetoed a Republican-backed bill intended to support the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown",
      "PHOENIX -- Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs on Friday vetoed a Republican-backed bill intended to support the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown by requiring local and state officials in Arizona to cooperate with federal enforcement efforts.",
      "Under the proposal, local and state officials couldn\u2019t prohibit or restrict cooperation with federal immigration efforts or block the use of federal databases and grant funds related to immigration enforcement.",
      "It also would force cooperation on immigration detainers \u2014 requests from the federal government to hold onto people already in state custody until immigration authorities could pick them up.",
      "Supporters say the measure is needed to ensure federal authorities can safely and more easily take custody of immigrants, rather than having to track them down later after they have already been released from state prisons or county jails.",
      "Opponents say the state should leave immigration enforcement to the federal government and that the cooperation required in the bill would be expensive for local governments to carry out and would harm the cooperation local police get from people in immigrant communities.",
      "They also point out that immigration laws passed by the Arizona Legislature in the past have led to legal problems, such as a 2013 racial profiling verdict against then-Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s office for his signature traffic patrols that targeted immigrants.",
      "Senate President Warren Petersen, a Republican from Gilbert, said his proposal aims to ensure that Arizona is a \u201cpartner and not an obstacle\u201d where President Donald Trump's immigration efforts are concerned.",
      "Under the bill, state prisons and county jails would be required to enter agreements with Washington to temporarily house people with detainers. Local agencies would be required to comply with detainers and tell judges who are determining bail when a given individual has an immigration detainer.",
      "The bill would also require Arizona\u2019s attorney general to investigate alleged violations of the cooperation rules and let the attorney general sue to bring an agency into compliance. Supporters say state-shared revenues to local government could be withheld until compliance is reached. Arizona's landmark 2010 immigration law also addressed the issue of state and local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.",
      "The law bars state and local governments from limiting the enforcement of federal immigration law and lets residents sue over alleged violations.",
      "State officials, immigrant rights advocates and an association representing counties say they are unaware of any such lawsuits being filed in the nearly 15 years since it was signed into law.",
      "A little over a year ago, Hobbs vetoed a bill that would have made it a state crime for noncitizens to enter the state through Mexico at any location other than a port of entry. The Republican-led Legislature then bypassed the governor and voted to put a similar measure on the November 2024 ballot, which then won approval from voters.",
      "Since Trump won a second term, Hobbs promised to work with his administration on issues like combating fentanyl trafficking, but has acknowledged the worries some families feel about the immigration crackdown.",
      "Hobbs has vowed to veto all bills sent to her in a standoff with the Legislature until there is a compromise on funding for a state agency that provides services for people with developmental disabilities.",
      "GOP lawmakers say Hobbs has mismanaged agency funds. Hobbs counters that Republicans are leveraging the crisis for \u201cpolitical warfare.\u201d She has said she is willing to veto even bills that she supports.",

      "A U.S. district judge in California has ordered the Trump administration to provide probationary workers fired en masse a written statement saying they were not terminated for poor performance",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A U.S. district judge in San Francisco on Friday ordered the Trump administration to provide probationary workers fired en masse a written statement saying they were not terminated for performance reasons, but as part of a government-wide termination.",
      "Judge William Alsup is overseeing a lawsuit brought by labor unions and nonprofits contesting the mass firings of thousands of probationary workers in February under Republican President Donald Trump.",
      "In March, Alsup ordered six federal agencies to reinstate probationary workers because their terminations were directed by the Office of Personnel Management, which did not have the authority to fire workers at any other agency but its own.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court last week blocked Alsup\u2019s order requiring the administration to return those terminated employees to work, but did not decide whether the firings were unlawful.",
      "Alsup was particularly upset that the firings of probationary workers \u2014 many young and early in their careers \u2014 followed an OPM template stating that the person had been fired for poor performance.",
      "\u201cTermination under the false pretense of performance is an injury that will persist for the working life of each civil servant,\u201d wrote Alsup in Friday's order. \u201cThe stain created by OPM\u2019s pretense will follow each employee through their careers and will limit their professional opportunities.\u201d",
      "The administration has defined performance to account for job indispensability as Trump seeks to drastically reduce the federal workforce.",
      "Lawyers for the administration also say that OPM did not order the firings, but Alsup found it was impossible for federal agencies to assess each worker's performance in only a matter of days.",
      "In Friday's order, Alsup said the fired workers must receive the written statements by May 8. If a worker was fired after an individualized evaluation of that employee\u2019s performance or fitness, the agency must submit by May 8 \u201ca declaration, under oath and seal, stating so and providing the individual reasoning underpinning that termination.\u201d",
      "A federal judge in Maryland overseeing a similar complaint brought by 19 states found the administration did not follow laws set out for large-scale layoffs, including 60 days\u2019 advance notice.",
      "A preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge James Bredar ordering reinstatement of the workers was overturned last week by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",

      "The memo from AmeriCorps\u2019 interim director told staff that the administrative leave would remain in effect until future notice. It was sent Wednesday, the day after the agency\u2019s National Civilian Community Corps members were informed that they would be discharged from their service terms early. The dismissal of young volunteers came as the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency make cuts to government workforce and services.",
      "About 15% of the agency\u2019s staff remained active, according to an AmeriCorps staff member who provided the internal communications to the AP on condition of anonymity because the staff member was not authorized to do so. AmeriCorps employs more than 500 full-time federal workers and has an operating budget of roughly $1 billion.",
      "\u201cDuring the period that you are on administrative leave you are not to enter AmeriCorps premises, access AmeriCorps systems, or attempt to use your position or authority with AmeriCorps in any way without my prior permission or prior permission of a supervisor in your chain of command,\u201d the memo reads.",
      "The agency oversees a number of volunteering programs and dispatches 200,000 volunteers across the country to work with schoolchildren, veterans and older adults, among other things, according to its website. AmeriCorps NCCC, which completed its 30th year last year, employs more than 2,000 people ages 18 to 26 participating for a roughly 10-month service term, according to the program\u2019s website.",
      "A request for comment was left with AmeriCorps on Friday.",

      "AmeriCorps and NCCC have long been targets for possible budget cuts. NCCC funding amounted to nearly $38 million last fiscal year.",
      "NCCC members are tasked with working on several projects related to education, housing, urban and rural development, land conservation, and disaster relief, driving from one assignment to another across the country.",
      "AmeriCorps pays for volunteers\u2019 basic expenses, including housing, meals and a \u201climited health benefit,\u201d as well as a \u201cmodest\u201d living allowance, according to the program. The program also provided members who complete their 1,700-hour service term with funding for future education expenses or to apply to certain student loans. That benefit was worth about $7,300 this service year.",
      "The volunteers are especially visible after natural disasters, including Hurricane Helene last year and the deadly wildfires in Los Angeles this year. The organization said on social media last month that teams have served 8 million service hours on nearly 3,400 disaster projects since 1999.",
      "The dismantling of the agency will disrupt programs across the country and waste away decades of experience, said Jade Marshalek, a AmeriCorps NCCC member who was discharged this week. She was most recently in Seattle on a program helping people file their taxes.",

    "summary": "What is happening with US bonds, why Donald Trump cares and how ordinary Americans could be affected.",
    "story": [
      "Stock markets around the world have been relatively settled this week after a period of chaos, sparked by US trade tariffs.",
      "But investors are still closely watching a part of the market which rarely moves dramatically - the US bond market.",
      "Governments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money for public spending and in return they pay interest.",
      "Recently, in an extremely rare move the rate the US government had to pay on its bonds rose sharply, while the price of bonds themselves fell.",
      "The volatility suggests investors were losing confidence in the world's biggest economy.",
      "You may think it's too esoteric to bother you, but here's why it matters and how it may change President Trump's mind on tariffs.",
      "What is a government bond?",
      "When a government wants to borrow money, it usually does so by selling bonds - known as \"Treasuries\" in the US -  to investors on financial markets.",
      "Such payments are made over a number of pre-agreed years before a full and final payment is made when the bond \"matures\" - in other words, expires.",
      "Investors who buy bonds are mainly made up of financial institutions, ranging from pension funds to central banks like the Bank of England.",
      "What is happening with US bonds?",
      "Investors buy government bonds because they are seen as a safe place to invest their money. There is little risk a government will not repay the money, especially an economic superpower like the US.",
      "So when the economy is turbulent and investors want to take money out of volatile stocks and shares markets, they usually place that cash in US bonds.",
      "But recently that hasn't happened.",
      "Initially, following the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement on 2 April when shares fell, investors did appear to flock to US bonds.",
      "However, when the first of these tariffs kicked in on 5 April and Trump doubled down on his policies that weekend, investors began dumping government bonds, sending the interest rate the US government would have to pay to borrow money up sharply.",
      "The so-called yield for US government borrowing over 10 years shot up from 3.9% to 4.5%, while the 30-year yield spiked at almost 5%. Movements of 0.2% in either direction are considered a big deal.",
      "Why the dramatic sell-off? In short, the uncertainty over the impact of tariffs on the US economy led to investors no longer seeing government bonds as such a safe bet, so demanded bigger returns to buy them.",
      "The higher the perceived risk, the higher the yield investors want to compensate for taking it.",
      "How does this affect ordinary Americans?",
      "If the US government is spending more on debt interest repayments, it can affect budgets and public spending as it becomes more costly for the government to sustain itself.",
      "But it can also have a direct impact on households and even more so on businesses.",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, says when investors charge higher rates to lend the government money, other rates for lending that have more risk attached, such as mortgages, credit cards and car loans, also tend to rise.",
      "Businesses, especially small ones, are likely to be hardest hit by any immediate change in borrowing rates, as most homeowners in the US have fixed-rate deals of between 15 and 30 years. If businesses can't get access to credit, that can halt economic growth and lead to job losses over time.",
      "Mr Canavan adds that banks can become more cautious in lending money, which could impact the US economy.",
      "First-time buyers and those wishing to move home could also face higher costs, he says, which could impact the housing market in the longer term. It's common in the US for small business owners starting out to use the equity in their home as collateral.",
      "Why does Trump care?",
      "Following the introduction of tariffs, Trump urged his nation to \"hang tough\", but it appears the potential threat to jobs and the US economy stopped the president in his tracks.",
      "Following the ructions in the bond markets, he introduced a 90-day pause for the higher tariffs on every country except China. The 10% blanket tariff, however, on all countries remains.",
      "It proved a pressure point for Trump - and now the world knows it.",
      "\"Although President Donald Trump was able to resist the stock market sell-off, once the bond market began to weaken too, it was only a matter of time before he folded,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "According to US media reports, it was Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, inundated with calls from business leaders, who played a key part in swaying Trump.",
      "Is this similar to Liz Truss's mini-Budget?",
      "The bond market reaction has led to comparisons with former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's infamous mini-Budget of September 2022. The unfunded tax cuts announced then spooked investors, who dumped UK government bonds, resulting in the Bank of England stepping in to buy bonds to save pension funds from collapse.",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank, the US Federal Reserve, might have been forced to step in if the sell-off had worsened.",
      "While bond yields have settled, some might argue the damage has already been done as they remain higher than before the blanket tariffs kicked in.",
      "\"Arguably the most worrying aspect of the [recent] turmoil... is an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds and the dollar, akin to what the UK experienced in 2022,\" according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics.",
      "But unless you're a first-time buyer or selling your home, Americans are unlikely to be immediately hit by higher mortgage costs, unlike Brits who were securing new shorter-term fixed deals.",
      "How is China being linked to US bonds?",
      "Since 2010, foreign ownership of US bonds has almost doubled, rising by $3 trillion, according to Deutsche Bank.",
      "Japan holds the most US Treasuries, but China, the US's arch enemy in this global trade war, is the second biggest holder of US government debt globally.",
      "Questions were raised about whether it sparked the debt sell-off in response to being hit with huge tariffs.",
      "However, this is unlikely as any fire sale \"would impoverish China more than it would hurt the US\", according to Capital Economics.",

    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

      "From mid-October, Chinese ship owners and operators will be charged $50 per ton of cargo with the fees increasing each year for the next three years.",
      "There have been concerns that the measures would further disrupt global trade after US President Donald Trump's raft of tariff policies, but the fee is less severe than originally suggested.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry said the fees will raise prices for American consumers and \"will not revitalise the US shipbuilding industry\".",
      "The US Trade Representative (USTR) said: \"China has largely achieved its dominance goals, severely disadvantaging US companies, workers, and the US economy\".",
      "Fees on Chinese vessel owners and operators of ships built in China will be based on the weight of their cargo, how many containers they carry or the number of vehicles onboard.",

    "summary": "The temporary measure by the government is aimed at stopping the spread of foot and mouth disease.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government has temporarily banned people from bringing cheese and some meats from the European Union (EU) into the country to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease.",
      "But what does that actually mean in practice - and should you be concerned?",
      "What has been banned?",
      "Pork, beef, lamb, mutton, goat, venison and any other products made from these meats - such as sausages - from the EU have been banned. It also applies to pet food.",
      "In addition, milk and dairy products - like butter, cheese and yoghurt - from the EU have also been prohibited.",
      "It covers items such as sandwiches and cured meats as well as raw meats and milk \"regardless of whether it is packed or packaged or whether it has been bought at duty free\".",
      "However, there are exceptions such as chicken, duck, goose and any other products made from these.",
      "Who does the ban apply to?",
      "The measure is only directed at people arriving in Great Britain - as in, England, Wales or Scotland - from the EU.",
      "It does not apply to Northern Ireland, which has its own measures in place to contain foot and mouth disease.",
      "The ban covers anyone travelling by any mode of transport - whether that's by plane, train, bus or by car.",
      "But it will not be imposed on those arriving to Great Britain from Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or the Isle of Man.",
      "Are commercially imported cheeses and meats banned too?",
      "The ban only applies to travellers bringing in items personally - not commercial importers such as farmers or shops.",
      "The reason, according to the UK government, is that commercial meat and cheese imports face higher standards than individuals are subjected to.",
      "They must go through heat treatment, which is meant to kill germs, and come with health certificates signed by vets.",
      "How can animals get foot and mouth disease from meat and dairy products?",
      "The disease typically spreads between animals through direct contact. But they can also catch it by eating contaminated meat or dairy products.",
      "Any products of animal origin, like meat and dairy, could be contaminated with foot and mouth disease.",
      "Even if they are for human consumption, if they are thrown away in a way that could come into contact with foraging wildlife or domestic livestock, that presents a risk.",
      "Should I be worried?",
      "Foot and mouth disease is harmless to humans and there are no cases in the UK -  but it is highly contagious for animals.",
      "It affects cattle, sheep, pigs and, according to the government, \"other cloven-hoofed animals such as wild boar, deer, llamas and alpacas\".",
      "Animals that catch it typically come down with a high temperature before developing blisters, usually around the mouth or feet. It can make animals lame and, for the very young, result in fatalities.",
      "How long will the ban last?",
      "The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs introduced the measure on Saturday, 12 April and did not give an end date.",
      "The BBC understands the ban will stay in place until the government believes there is no significant risk from travellers bringing banned meat and dairy into Great Britain.",
      "Why didn't I know about this?",
      "The government put out a release last Friday ahead of the ban coming into force on Saturday.",
      "It told border control and airlines to make passengers aware of the rules and has rolled out a digital and social media campaign.",
      "Eurostar has also been sending out emails to passengers letting them know about the UK rules.",
      "However, many people who have travelled from the EU to Great Britain since the weekend told the BBC they were unaware of the measure and were not told - with no signs in the airport and no checks carried out.",
      "Anyone travelling should follow the rules.",
      "The government says items could be seized and destroyed at the border and, in serious cases, offenders could be fined up to \u00a35,000 in England.",
      "Can I take meat and milk products from the UK into the EU?",
      "No, travellers are not normally allowed to bring meat and milk products into the EU from the UK for personal use.",
      "This has nothing to do with the latest announcement though - it has been the case since Brexit, with the UK facing the same rules as every other non-EU country.",
      "But there is an exemption for powdered baby milk, baby food, or special foods for humans or animals where there is a medical need.",

      "Tesla has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Ms Balan said she believes the case will now in effect go back to square one, and new proceedings can be launched.",
      "\"We are hoping we will start a new lawsuit and we will have the chance to take on Elon Musk in front of a jury and judge,\" she said.",

      "Ms Balan claimed she was worried the carpets were curling underneath some pedals in Tesla models, creating a safety hazard.",
      "She said managers rebuffed her concerns, became hostile, and she lost her job.",
      "She then won a wrongful dismissal case - but this turned out to be the start of a long journey through the courts.",
      "Ms Balan was publicly accused by Tesla of using its resources for a \"secret project\" - accusations which amount to embezzlement, a crime under US law.",
      "She has consistently denied the accusation, and decided to bring a defamation case against the firm in 2019.",
      "\"I want to clear my name,\" she told BBC News last year.",
      "\"I wish Elon Musk had the decency to apologise.\"",
      "A court then decided Ms Balan's case should be subject to arbitration per a contract she signed while working for Tesla.",
      "The arbitrator found in favour of the firm and Musk, dismissing her claims, due to California's statute of limitations - meaning too much time had passed since the alleged defamatory statements were made.",

      "And Bill Moran, Ms Balan's attorney, agreed the legal process is far from over.",
      "But he said the case was \"revived\" by the latest ruling.",
      "\"We are confident we can secure her either a new arbitration or alternatively a trial in court so that her case can be heard on the merits after so many years,\" he said.",
      "\"She has fought cancer while waging this case... she is the epitome of strength and resolve, and she is now one step closer to getting the justice she deserves.\"",

      "China's already sluggish economy is bracing for the impact on a key source of revenue - exports.",
      "Beijing announced on Wednesday its GDP grew by 5.4% between January and March, compared with the same period a year earlier.",
      "The figure has exceeded expectations but reflects the period before US tariffs jumped from 10% to 145%, and Chinese officials warned of more economic pain ahead.",
      "While both Washington and Beijing have said they are open to negotiating, neither have made a move to do so yet.",
      "When that happens, Li, 58, will play a key role. He previously served as a deputy permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva and has held several key jobs in the commerce ministry.",

      "\"It might be that in the view of China's top leadership, given how tensions have continued escalating, they need someone else to break the impasse... and finally start negotiating,\" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a senior adviser to the Conference Board's China Centre.",

      "UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",

      "Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\".",

      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",

      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",
      "The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away."

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "The US has \"dropped the ball\" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021.",
      "Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.",
      "He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories.",
      "So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?",
      "Microchips: The secret sauce",
      "Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

      "The number of deals that need a deposit of 5% or 10% have risen to their highest level since then, data from financial information service Moneyfacts suggests.",
      "The extra choice is a boost for first-time buyers, although house prices and mortgage rates are higher than they were for much of the last 17 years.",
      "And competition is tough, with homes typically listed for just over a month before a sale is agreed, according to separate figures from property website Zoopla.",
      "The UK housing market has been relatively settled in recent times, although buyers still need to navigate uncertainty over interest rates and changes to stamp duty in England and Northern Ireland.",
      "'Flourishing choice'",
      "For buyers able to offer a deposit of 5% of the home loan, there are 442 mortgages to choose from, according to Moneyfacts.",
      "Two years ago, the choice was from fewer than half of that total, at 204.",
      "Borrowers able to pay a 10% deposit now have 845 products to choose from, up from 684 in April 2023.",
      "However, they still have to pay a mortgage rate of well over 5% on average, while a borrower who pays a 40% deposit typically pays a rate of under 5%.",
      "It has been hard for many prospective first-time buyers to save due to the rising cost of renting in recent years.",
      "Doug Hepper, 30, from Tewkesbury, is a dad and wants to buy his first home.",
      "But due to the cost of living doing so is almost impossible in the short-term, he said.",
      "\"When I grew up, I thought the normal thing was to get married, have kids and buy a house around the time of being 30,\" he added.",
      "\"The kid came first but I never thought the buying the house part would be so far out of reach.\"",
      "But Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, said there was a flourishing choice of mortgages for those whose ability to pay a deposit is stretched.",
      "\"A rise in product availability for aspiring homeowners is a healthy step in the right direction,\" she said.",
      "However, she said only 6% of all deals available to borrowers across fixed and variable mortgages had a deposit requirement of 5%, so there was still \"room for improvement\".",
      "Mortgage rates remain difficult to predict owing to uncertainty created by US tariff policy on the wider economy.",
      "While securing a mortgage is one thing, buyers also need to act relatively quickly when it comes to finding a new home, data suggests.",
      "Homes in England and Wales spend an average of 36 days on the market before a sale is agreed, according to news figures from the property portal Zoopla.",
      "Sales were agreed on half of homes within two months of being listed, it said. To complete a sale, sellers and buyers will typically need another four to six months, depending on the complexity of the transaction.",
      "The fastest sales were agreed for two-bedroom homes, at an average of 23 days, while homes with four bedrooms or more typically took an extra 15 days.",
      "Homes in northern regions of England tended to sell faster than homes in the south, where prices are higher, it said.",
      "Even so, the fastest selling, with an agreed sale taking an average of 19 days, had a north-south mix, with Manchester and the London borough of Waltham Forest hitting that mark.",
      "\"Households that are thinking about listing their home and moving in 2025 need to set their asking price at the right level and take the advice of local agents,\" said Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla.",
      "\"Buyers have a lot more choice of homes for sale than a year ago. Aiming too high on the asking price is likely to impact saleability and how long you may have to wait to agree a sale.\"",

      "This was the stamp of authenticity that Ms Deane had long sought. \"We were obviously very excited about that,\" she says.",
      "So her employee opened a link to what turned out to be a fake Instagram verification form that requested log-in credentials. She filled it in, divulging the username and password, and shortly afterwards the account was taken over by hackers.",

      "Initially she filled out the admin dispute form and sent it off, but heard nothing. Multiple emails followed but no action was taken.",
      "\"It's so incredibly frustrating when you're dealing with your account being hacked and there is no-one to talk to,\" she says. \"It's almost traumatising because there is no-one who understands and can help escalate it.\"",
      "Eventually an email came from Meta, telling her that the case was closed, even though she was still unable to access her page.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:15:59 GMT",
    "summary": "As the trade war continues to escalate, China has hit back at Trump by suspending exports of rare earth minerals.",
    "story": [
      "As the trade war between China and the US escalates, attention has been focused on the increasingly high levels of tit-for-tat tariffs the two countries are imposing on one another.",
      "But slapping reciprocal tariffs on Washington is not the only way Beijing has been able to retaliate.",
      "China has now also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets, dealing a major blow to the US.",
      "The move has laid bare how reliant America is on these minerals.",
      "This week, Trump ordered the commerce department to come up with ways to boost US production of critical minerals and cut reliance on imports - an attempt by Washington to reclaim this critical industry.  But why exactly are rare earths so important and how could they shake up the trade war?",
      "What are rare earths and what are they used for?",
      "\"Rare earths\" are a group of 17 chemically similar elements that are crucial to the manufacture of many high-tech products.",
      "Most are abundant in nature, but they are known as \"rare\" because it is very unusual to find them in a pure form, and they are very hazardous to extract.",
      "Although you may not be familiar with the names of these rare earths - like Neodymium, Yttrium and Europium - you will be very familiar with the products that they are used in.",
      "For instance, Neodymium is used to make the powerful magnets used in loudspeakers, computer hard drives, EV motors and jet engines that enable them to be smaller and more efficient.",
      "Yttrium and Europium are used to manufacture television and computer screens because of the way they display colours.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" explains Thomas Kruemmer, Director of Ginger International Trade and Investment.",
      "Rare earths are also critical to the production of medical technology like laser surgery and MRI scans, as well as key defence technologies.",
      "What does China control?",
      "China has a near monopoly on extracting rare earths as well as on refining them - which is the process of separating them from other minerals.",
      "The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that China accounts for about 61% of rare earth production and 92% of their processing.",
      "That means it currently dominates the rare earths supply chain and has the capacity to decide which companies can and cannot receive supplies of rare earths.",
      "Both the extraction and processing of these rare earths are costly and polluting.",
      "All rare earth resources also contain radioactive elements, which is why many other countries, including those in the EU, are reluctant to produce them.",
      "\"Radioactive waste from production absolutely requires safe, compliant, permanent disposal. Currently all disposal facilities in EU are temporary,\" says Mr Kruemmer.",
      "But China's dominance in the rare earth supply chain didn't take place overnight - but rather, is the result of decades of strategic government policies and investment.",
      "In a visit to Inner Mongolia in 1992, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who oversaw China's economic reform, famously said: \"The Middle East has oil and China has rare earths\".",
      "\"Beginning in the late 20th century, China prioritised the development of its rare earth mining and processing capabilities, often at lower environmental standards and labour costs compared to other nations,\" said Gavin Harper, a critical materials research fellow at the University of Birmingham.",
      "\"This allowed them to undercut global competitors and build a near-monopoly across the entire value chain, from mining and refining to the manufacturing of finished products like magnets.\"",
      "How has China restricted exports of these minerals?",
      "In response to tariffs imposed by Washington, China earlier this month began ordering restrictions on the exports of seven rare earth minerals - most of which are known as \"heavy\" rare earths, which are crucial to the defence sector.",
      "These are less common and are harder to process than \"light\" rare earths, which also makes them more valuable.",
      "From 4 April, all companies now have to get special export licenses in order to send rare earths and magnets out of the country.",
      "That is because as a signatory to the international treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, China has the ability to control the trade of \"dual use products\".",
      "According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), this leaves the US particularly vulnerable as there is no capacity outside China to process heavy rare earths.",
      "How could this impact the US?",
      "A US Geological report notes that between 2020 and 2023, the US relied on China for 70% of its imports of all rare earth compounds and metals.",
      "This means that the new restrictions have the ability to hit the US hard.",
      "Heavy rare earths are used in many military fields such as missiles, radar, and permanent magnets.",
      "A CSIS report notes that defence technologies including F-35 jets, Tomahawk missiles and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles all depend on these minerals.",
      "It adds that this comes as China \"expands its munitions production and acquires advanced weapons systems and equipment at a pace five to six times faster than the United States\".",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial,\" said Mr Kroemmer.",
      "And it's not only in the field of defence.",
      "US manufacturing, which Trump has said he hopes to revive through the imposition of his tariffs, stand to be severely impacted.",
      "\"Manufacturers, particularly in defence and high-tech, face potential shortages and production delays due to halted shipments and limited inventories,\" said Dr Harper.",
      "\"Prices for critical rare earth materials are expected to surge, increasing the immediate costs of components used in a wide range of products, from smartphones to military hardware,\" he says, adding that this could result in potential production slowdowns for affected US companies.",
      "If such a shortage from China persists in the long-run, the US could potentially begin diversifying its supply chains and scaling up its domestic and processing capabilities, though this would still require \"substantial and sustained investment, technological advancements and potentially higher overall costs compared to the previous dependence on China\".",
      "And it's clear this is something already on Trump's mind. This week, he ordered an investigation into the national security risks posed by the US' reliance on such  critical minerals.",
      "\"President Trump recognises that an overreliance on foreign critical minerals and their derivative products could jeopardise US defence capabilities, infrastructure development, and technological innovation,\" said the order.",
      "\"Critical minerals, including rare earth elements, are essential for national security and economic resilience.\"",
      "China's precious metals the US can't do without",

      "These might have been places that the US could have sourced some of its rare earth exports from, but the adversarial tone Trump has struck with them means the US could be left with very few alternative suppliers.",
      "\"The challenge the U.S. faces is two-fold, on the one hand it has alienated China who provides the monopoly supply of rare earths, and on the other hand it is also antagonising many nations that have previously been friendly collaborators through tariffs and other hostile actions,\" said Dr Harper.",

      "Now, the current 20,000 sq m site is a hub for companies developing innovative health technologies, alongside AI, cybersecurity, gaming and defence tech start-ups.",
      "\"The whole place is really based on community,\" says Maria 01's CEO Sarita Runeberg. \"We bring people together so they can network\u2026 and find different kinds of resources to grow their businesses.\"",
      "There are also office perks including a pool table, table football, running and ice bathing clubs, and in true Finnish-style, a sauna.",

      "While co-working spaces for tech companies are well established across the Nordics, Maria 01 is the largest of its kind in the region.",

      "\"It's not just about rankings,\" says Marjo Ilmari, who runs the start-up services team at Business Finland, the government agency that promotes investment and innovation.",

      "One likely reason for the dip, says Mr Pentikainen, is a decision to raise VAT from 24% to 25.5% last September, the highest rate in western Europe. The government said this was a \"difficult but necessary\" move designed to stabilise public finances.",
      "But Mr Pentikainen suggests it could make Finland's start-up ecosystem less competitive for international founders.",
      "The Finnish government has also recently toughened up citizenship requirements, meaning foreign entrepreneurs now need to stay at least eight years instead of five in order to obtain a passport, and will soon also be required to pass a test on Finnish society and culture if they want to settle long-term.",
      "Back at Maria 01, Mr Parker, the health company founder, says he's confident Finland's start-up ecosystem will continue to expand and attract international talent. But he warns it might lose some of the aspects that have so far made it an attractive option for entrepreneurs.",

    "summary": "A Guyanese political commentator says Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in the country.",
    "story": [
      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",
      "Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.",
      "Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments. The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",
      "In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.",
      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",
      "Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc.",
      "Mia Mottley, chair of the intergovernmental group Caricom, said the region was facing the most challenging of times since its 15 member states gained independence several decades ago.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work to become more self-sufficient, but\u2026 this trade war will mean higher prices for all of us,\" she said in a recent statement.",
      "Ms Mottley added that it was vital to redouble efforts to \"invest in Caribbean agricultural production and light manufacturing\".",
      "\"We must build our ties with Africa, Central and Latin America, and renew those ties with some of our older partners around the world, in the United Kingdom and Europe, and in Canada. We must not rely solely on one or two markets.\"",
      "Ms Mottley, who is also the prime minister of Barbados, is calling for Washington to \"work with\" the Caribbean to keep prices down.",

      "We are in relatively unknown territory in modern economics and the picture seems to change almost every day, so predictions have to be taken with a large dose of salt.",
      "In theory, when tariffs are announced, and retaliation comes, then higher taxes all round will make goods more expensive for consumers.",

      "Alternatively, the government's drive for growth could successfully propel the economy against these headwinds.",
      "And there is even greater pressure on policymakers at the Bank of England to help boost growth by cutting interest rates, lowering the cost of borrowing for loans and mortgages.",
      "Cutting interest rates usually adds to consumer demand, and risks raising prices and the rate of inflation further from its 2% target.",

      "\"I love flash cards - they're so easy and quick,\" says youngest daughter Jess.",
      "\"It also means we can get involved as well,\" adds dad Steve, explaining that parents can help to test their children on them.",
      "3. Stay connected to what you love",
      "When we're stressed, it can be tempting to push aside time for fun and relaxation - but it's actually really important in helping us to perform well in exams, Stevie says.",
      "\"We really need to look after our brains. It's really important to get the balance.\"",
      "For Emma, reading or walks with her mum, dad and their dog Maisie was important time to carve out during A-levels.",

      "\"You've worked so hard and whatever happens, we'll be here to support you.\"",

      "And when it's all over?",

      "\"I just walked out by myself, got my bag and went home,\" she says. \"I was like, 'I'm not ruining this, goodbye!'\"",

      "The pair had been accused of breaking the university's student code of conduct by disrupting a business meeting and \"behaving in an intimidating and disorderly manner\" towards staff on 22 May.",
      "The University of Birmingham said it had a \"strong and longstanding commitment to freedom of speech and academic freedom\" backed by its code of conduct.",
      "It added that it was important that the university was \"a safe and welcoming space for all our community\".",
      "The two students have a history of pro-Palestinan activism on campus, with the University of Birmingham previously taking legal action against Ms Ali and others over encampments last summer.",
      "The demonstrations were in response to Israel's full-scale invasion of Gaza, following Hamas's cross-border attack in October 2023 that saw about 1,200 people killed and 251 others taken hostage.",
      "Misconduct charges were brought against the two final-year students after they had joined a group wearing t-shirts painted with red marks and chanting slogans outside a meeting about the university's investments last May.",
      "At the time, protesters claimed they were peacefully trying to encourage the university to financially divest from companies linked to Israel.",
      "However, staff members inside the meeting reported that it was a \"frightening\" experience for them.",
      "One witness statement heard by the disciplinary panel read: \"The whole incident did not feel peaceful, it felt deliberately disruptive.\"",
      "During their hearing, the two students said they had argued that the university was in violation of the United Nations' guidelines on freedom of speech.",
      "\"It's not lawful to have a policy that requires you to authorise protest,\" said Ms Listrat.",
      "She added that the policy was harmful as it required a named organiser and advance notice, among other requirements.",
      "The students said they had faced wider discrimination over their views.",
      "\"Muslim students are very pro-Palestinian,\" said Ms Ali.",
      "\"I think it goes back to the wider issue of Islamophobia on campus and conflating pro-Palestinian activism with something that is dangerous and intimidating.\"",
      "While waiting for the hearing Ms Listrat said she believed she was under surveillance, after security came up to her and told her that she was \"banned from campus\", despite that not being the case.",
      "\"I recently did a Subject Access Request and found that the university has kept a folder on me with CCTV footage,\" she said.",
      "Both students also said they were disappointed at their Guild of Students, with Ms Ali labelling their lack of support as \"shambolic\".",
      "\"It was easier to get support from the United Nations than our own student union,\" Ms Listrat said.",
      "While unable to comment on individual cases, the Guild of Students said support was available to students involved in disciplinary processes through its trained Advice team.",

      "After receiving letters notifying them of the disciplinary process, the students said they feared expulsion.",
      "\"There was this uncertainty about whether either of us were going to graduate,\" said Ms Ali.",
      "\"We're doing our dissertations, final-year exams and assignments. I could not even apply for certain postgrad opportunities.\"",
      "To fight against proceedings, the pair set up a campaign, called UoB2, in January in a bid to attract publicity for their position.",
      "A petition supporting them attracted more than 2,000 signatures and was endorsed  by several key figures, including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.",
      "They had also enlisted the help of the European Legal Support Centre, which put forward legal submissions to the misconduct panel and argued that the university had a legal duty to protect freedom of speech.",
      "Less than a month before the hearing, Ms Listrat was elected as the incoming Guild of Students President and she said she was worried she might lose her position.",
      "\"I had a personal crisis at that point,\" she said.",
      "\"If I was going to be expelled and lose my job, it would've impacted my life in many different ways.\"",
      "'Really disgusted'",
      "While the hearing took place inside the university library last Monday, a rally including staff, students and members of the local community gathered outside to show their support.",
      "Ellen Shobrook, president of the Birmingham branch of the University and College Union (UCU), said the trade union had already tried to open a dialogue with the university about its Freedom of Speech Policy.",
      "\"I feel really disgusted,\" she told the BBC while the hearing was taking place.",
      "\"The students are being punished in a disproportionate and repressive way, which has a chilling effect on the ability for people to peacefully protest.\"",
      "In response to Ms Ali and Ms Listrat's claims, the university said it rejected \"any suggestion that our Freedom of Speech Code of Practice is unlawful\".",
      "\"It was developed with expert internal and external legal advice, and has also been relied upon in a High Court judgment,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "The university added that its disciplinary process was \"fair and objective\" and involved a panel unconnected to the original investigation.",
      "It also rejected any suggestions of Islamophobia.",
      "\"Our university community includes staff, students and visitors from a wide range of backgrounds and beliefs, a spokesperson said.",
      "\"We will not tolerate any form of discrimination or racism, including Islamophobia.",
      "\"We maintain regular discussions with a range of student and staff representatives to listen to their views and ensure that they feel supported.\"",
      "Update 16 April: In a previous version of this story Antonia Linstrat said the university's code of conduct required 21 days' notice for a protest on campus, rather that 14 days, as the policy outlines.",

      "\"The whole experience [on the show] kind of opened my eyes to real travel,\" Watts tells us over a video call from Portugal, while taking a break from refereeing a football match.",
      "\"I think there are definitely two different types of travel that we're used to in the UK; shallow travel, as I'd call it, where you go on holiday and you see what you want to see and you stay within your comfort zone or hotel.",
      "\"And then I'd say there's real authentic travel whereby you see the world as it actually is.",
      "\"And I've just learned that I actually much prefer the authenticity of places... rather than the weather.\"",
      "Watts's main advice for readers with a similar wanderlust is to consider travelling further afield.",
      "\"Flights to Spain in the summer might be \u00a3300 return, but you are going to be paying extremely high prices for food, accommodation and things like that,\" he notes.",
      "\"Whereas, actually, if you go a little bit further afield, if you try Malaysia, Thailand, even Brazil, for sure the flights might be \u00a3600-700 but when you're actually there, you're spending \u00a320-25 a day maximum.\"",
      "He adds: \"You're helping local people and you're trying something new.\"",

      "He acknowledges that it's not for everyone, and that some people prefer to be away with friends and family, but he wants to encourage would-be travellers to \"throw yourself in\".",
      "\"I don't do things that would put me in danger because I think I have a responsibility to the people that follow me,\" he says.",

      "His favourite place he has been on his travels so far is \"without doubt\" Angel Falls in Venezuela, while his favourite country would be a coin flip between Jordan and Malaysia.",
      "One thing he'd still like to tick off his bucket list is visiting the remote island of Tuvalu in the South Pacific Ocean, which sounds like a pitch for a new TV show in itself.",
      "\"It's the least visited country in the world,\" he explains.",
      "\"Only 1,500 people go there every year. It's very difficult to get to, very expensive to get to.\"",
      "As well as becoming far better travelled, the past year has also seen him expand his horizons in other ways, acting as an ambassador for Young Minds UK, a mental health charity for young people, and Winston's Wish, a children and young people's grief charity.",

      "The rules, as usual, are no smart phones, no bank cards (just a small cash budget) and no air travel.",
      "Watts thinks it's going to be a \"really tough route\" and \"a topsy turvey\" series.",
      "\"China is very easy to get around but very hard to communicate,\" he stresses from personal experience. \"And a lot of China doesn't accept cash anymore.\"",
      "His \"number one piece of advice\" for anyone taking part is to learn from his mistakes and take a calculator and a whiteboard. \"We had to borrow notebooks and God knows what else\".",

      "James' reaction as he unboxes a rare, limited edition Labubu toy can only be described as pure, unadulterated joy.",
      "The YouTuber delightedly holds up a brown plush monster, which has been described by collectors as \"cute\", \"ugly\", \"creepy\" and everything in between.",
      "Labubus are furry snaggletoothed gremlins, which are designed by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung and sold by Chinese toy company Pop Mart.",
      "They're almost always sold out online and long queues often form outside the selected shops that stock them.",
      "Labubus are also primarily sold in the blind box format, meaning customers never know what version they'll get until they open them - a fact collectors have said adds to their appeal.",
      "While it's difficult to pin their recent rise in popularity to one particular ingredient, celebrity endorsement, social media unboxing videos and their ability to stir up nostalgia are all contributing factors.",
      "James Welsh, from Hampshire, sees his Labubu collectable as an investment, which he tells the BBC \"could probably earn a fair bit of money two or three years down the line\".",
      "He has just shy of 30 Labubus which retail at around \u00a325 for an individual toy or \u00a3153 for a box of six.",
      "He says he has \"spent hundreds and hundreds but not quite thousands\" on the dolls.",
      "Labubu maker Pop Mart has doubled its profits in the last year and is eying up global expansion in 2025.",
      "The company, which started 15 years ago, has been described as \"elevating toy buying to an act of trendy connoisseurship\" and praised for embracing non-traditional designs, which have made them a hit with collectors.",
      "Artist Kasing Lung is behind some of their popular toys including The Monsters series and Labubu.",
      "He credits living in The Netherlands as the inspiration behind the dolls and told Hypbeast \"I liked to read storybooks and was influenced by ancient European elf legends\".",
      "Lung added that during his childhood, \"there were no game consoles or computers, so I had to draw dolls with a pen, so I had the idea of painting fairy tales since I was a child\".",
      "He first came up with the designs in 2015 and signed a licensing agreement with Pop Mart in 2019 to make them into toys.",
      "Labubu as a name has no specific meaning, it is a fictional character based around an elf-like creature.",
      "James says his first thought when he saw the one of the toys was, \"they're creepy but they're also really cute and I need as many of them as I can get, I need them in every colour\".",
      "The 36-year-old adds, \"I think they [provide] some real escapism for millennials as it's like reverting back to your youth with these toys and collectables.\"",
      "A former stylist, he now primarily creates beauty and skincare content, but has recently gained thousands of views on his channel from Labubu unboxing videos.",
      "He tells the BBC: \"there is a strong link between these plush pendants and the fashion community as well.\"",
      "\"They're a way to express who you are, you can show that through the different characters, which add a pop of colour and fashion is fun, it's not serious at the end of the day, it's reflective of who you are.\"",
      "There are several iterations of Labubu - from vinyl figures to plush toys - but the keychain versions have become most popular recently.",
      "Labubu's ascent into mainstream culture has been steady - but was elevated last year by BLACKPINK star Lisa.",
      "The K-pop singer was seen with a Labubu creature hanging from her handbag and also called the toys \"her secret obsession\" in an interview.",
      "Rihanna was also spotted with one of the toys attached to her bag in recent weeks, which has led to fashion fans replicating her look.",
      "But for collectors such as 22-year-old Chulie, who shares her purchases on TikTok, she says Labubu becoming a \"fashion trend\" misses the point of why they're so loved.",
      "\"For me, it's all about the nostalgia and the surprise aspect,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "One of Pop Mart's biggest selling points for collectors is the way their toys are packaged in what's known as blind boxes, which make the experience of getting one like a lucky dip.",
      "You don't know what character you are getting until you unseal the package, so it's always a gamble for collectors.",
      "\"You know it's fun, it's a dopamine hit\", James says.",
      "\"It's gambling for some of us - kind of like a happy meal, you don't know what toy you're getting until you open it up.\"",
      "It also makes the toy perfect for the world of social media, as creators can catch their genuine surprise on camera and share it with other fans - something James says provides comfort and \"escapism from the real world\".",
      "Chulie says, as a child, she would collect Pokemon trading cards, so collecting another surprise item \"triggered memories for me\".",
      "\"When you're having a rough time, especially for me personally, it's a big serotonin boost to not only buy a collectable and keep it, but share the experience with other people as well,\" she adds.",
      "Others have compared Labubus to Beanie Babies, which were popular in the 1990s and 2000s, and say collecting Labubus evokes feelings of childhood nostalgia.",
      "For some fans, just documenting the experience of getting a Labubu is a talking point, with many showing the long queues and hours of research required to find out where new collections are being stocked.",
      "It's prompted backlash on some social media channels, with users criticising collectors that have bought large numbers of items.",
      "\"Just because you don't understand someone's hobby, doesn't mean it's not valid in any way,\" James says.",
      "While James hasn't spent hours and hours queuing to build his collection, he says he \"has gone out of my way\" to source authentic dolls online. As with any popular item, counterfeits have made their way onto the market.",
      "\"I spend a fair bit of money on my hobby, but it's my adult money,\" he jokes.",
      "Chulie says she currently has 10 Labubus, but has sold some to other fans when she's ended up with the same toy twice.",
      "\"When I first got exposed to them, I wasn't sure why people were spending money on them, because in the US they start at around $21 [\u00a316], which is minimum wage for a lot of people.",
      "\"But it's so addictive getting one, and it's really hard to stop buying once you start,\" she adds."

      "That, too, is strictly tongue-in-cheek.",

      "After 10 years in mid-ranking indie band Slow Club, the album propelled her into uncharted realms.",
      "There were magazine covers, nominations for the Mercury Prize and Brit Awards, a starring role on stage in Cabaret, a support slot with Adele and, yes, an appearance on Celebrity Bake Off \u2013 where, unfortunately, she burned her crumpets.",

      "\"I was thinking so big, but I still don't have access to the resources I need to make it as big as I wanted.\"",
      "Part of the problem was a punishing, but self-imposed, time limit.",
      "\"The music industry is like, 'You've got 10 minutes, then you're over and someone else is going to take your place',\" she explains.",
      "\"So I felt like I had no choice [but to commit to another record] if I wanted to build on what I'd done.",
      "\"But as painful as it was and as dark as it got, the second I'm back on stage performing it, I'm like, 'Oh, this is why I love it'.\"",

      "\"This really is all there is, and that's what you've got to get comfortable with.\"",
      "As the show opens, 10 dancers line up on either side of her, dressed in austere outfits that recall The Handmaid's Tale.",
      "Initially, their movements are stiff and restricted but, as Taylor describes suffocating relationships with emotionally-stunted men, they start to thrash and jerk their bodies.",
      "\"We start in that world where we're shackled, and then we exorcise it,\" Taylor explains.",
      "\"Over the course of the show, it all unravels and everyone ends up being themselves instead of conforming to these societal norms.\"",
      "A four-night theatre residency is an unusual way to launch an album. The audience is unfamiliar with most of the songs, and no-one's sure whether to absorb the performance attentively, or sing along and dance.",
      "Several times, laughter ripples through the theatre as the singer's more acerbic observations hit home. The following morning, she's not quite sure what to make of the reaction.",
      "\"Every time people laugh, my heart sinks,\" she says. \"But then I'm like, the lyrics are funny, aren't they?",
      "\"And I love changing the laughter into emotion. It feels like people are laughing because it's uncomfortable.\"",
      "In the end, the audience members mirror the on-stage narrative. Shaking off their discomfort, they rise out of their seats and start making an almighty racket.",

      "A Complicated Woman might be as cutting and powerful as its predecessor, but the melodies were designed for stadiums.",

      "\"I went mad for that song when it came out and, honestly, I played it over and over in the studio and said, 'I want to do this'.\"",
      "\"I was very inspired by trying to make it onto World Cup montages. That's a genre of music that I really, really enjoy.\"",
      "That's only half the story, though. The album is all about capturing the complex and contradictory impulses of a woman in her mid-30s.",
      "Recent single 69, for example, is a thumping house track on which Taylor talks with withering candour about her sex life. Imagine Madonna's Justify My Love, if she was really being honest.",
      "\"It's an idea I had for ages, of listing sex positions and scoring them so that there's no grey area [for prospective partners],\" the singer laughs.",
      "\"But there's a more political element, which is that women still aren't saying what they want in the bedroom. And I'm like, I can't bear this any more. Please let us just enjoy having sex.",
      "\"It's not exactly going to win an Ivor Novello Award for lyrics, but I think it stands on the album with moments that are more emotional and deep.\"",
      "Those moments include The Curse, a rousing ballad about using alcohol to dull her anxiety, which is possibly the best song Self Esteem's ever written.",
      "Her personal favourite, however, is called In Plain Sight. A collaboration with South African musician Moonchild Sanelly, it's a response to the criticism they've both received for speaking their minds.",
      "\"The world is saying who I am, but I thought I knew myself all these years,\" says Sanelly in a semi-improvised rap.",
      "\"I shrink to keep the peace, hoping I don't shake my purpose.\"",

      "As excitement built around Prioritise Pleasure in 2021, she started getting \"nasty messages\" on social media, which shook her up.",
      "\"I was really shocked the first time I got grief, because no-one's ever been that bothered about what I'm doing,\" she says.",
      "\"People say you should ignore it, but if you went to a wedding and had a nice day and one person called you an [expletive], who would you go home thinking about? It's just human nature.\"",
      "Eventually, the criticism took its toll.",
      "\"There were moments where I considered giving up, which shocked me because I've been this defiant, angry thing for so long,\" she says.",

    "summary": "The festival returns for a second weekend in the Californian desert. Here's how to watch at home.",
    "story": [
      "The best thing about Coachella is that it happens twice - so if you missed the first weekend, don't worry!",
      "Lady Gaga, Travis Scott, Charli XCX and everyone else will return to the Colorado Desert on Friday for a second dose of musical mayhem, and punishing gusts of wind.",
      "Better yet, the opening weekend let us know who was worth watching (Lady Gaga), who we can safely avoid (Travis Scott) and who might be this year's breakout star (Benson Boone).",
      "With that in mind, here's a guide to this weekend's sets - and when you can watch them on Coachella's comprehensive YouTube livestream.",
      "1) Lady Gaga confronts her inner demons",
      "Lady Gaga's elaborate stage performances have been known to collapse under the weight of their own ambition. Not this time.",
      "Her second visit to Coachella, after stepping in as a last-minute replacement for Beyonc\u00e9 in 2017, was one of the greatest pop performances ever. Two hours full of energy and presence and pounding synth hooks.",
      "Staged in a crumbling gothic opera house, the two-hour show depicted the star's  inner angels and demons wrestling for her soul.",
      "During Poker Face, the two sides faced off in a deadly game of chess; while Perfect Celebrity - a song about her tabloid commodification in the 2000s - saw her buried in a shallow grave, singing to a skeleton.",
      "It was bold and audacious and over the top, in all the best ways, with celebratory, nine-minute performance of Bad Romance to cap it all off.",
      "If you only watch one performance, make it this one.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 11:10pm on Friday (local time), or 7:10am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "2) Missy Elliot makes up for lost time",
      "Despite a career that's lasted three decades, Missy Elliot only staged her first ever tour last year.",
      "Luckily, tracks like Get Ur Freak On, Lose Control and Pass That Dutch still sound as fresh and futuristic now as they did first time around - and Missy's relative lack of stage experience was never apparent.",
      "She arrived onstage inside a giant car exo-skeleton, like a hip-hop Transformer, and sped through her set with pin-sharp choreography and boundless good humour.",
      "The only downside was that her set had to end after just 55 minutes.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 9:00pm on Friday (local time), or 5:00am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "3) Lola Young fights the flu",
      "\"I'm either going to faint or throw up,\" declared Lola Young near the start of her set last weekend. \"One of the two is about to happen\".",
      "The British singer, whose song Messy has been embraced by fans worldwide, was battling sickness and heatstroke throughout her set. But she powered through, leading a mass singalong to Messy, and debuting a new single called Spiders.",
      "With her health back on track, her second weekend performance should erase any bad memories from her debut.",
      "Watch on the Mojave Stage at 4:50pm on Friday (local time), or 12:50am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "4) Green Day are 'not part of the MAGA agenda'",
      "Although Travis Scott closed the main stage on Saturday, Green Day were technically the headliners - and the California band delivered a thrilling, cathartic set worthy of their billing.",
      "They plunged head-first into a furious rendition of American Idiot, keeping up their recent tradition of changing the lyrics, so that frontman Billie Joe Armstrong sang: \"I'm not part of the MAGA agenda\".",
      "That aside, politics were kept to a minimum, as the group delivered a high-voltage blast of their greatest hits, from the bratty pop-punk of Basket Case to the more reflective Boulevard of Broken Dreams.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 9:05pm on Saturday (local time), or 5:05am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "5) Post Malone's good-time hoedown",
      "\"Post-ee, Post-ee, Post-ee.\"",
      "It might have been the end of the weekend, but fans still had energy to spare for Post Malone's headline slot on Sunday night.",
      "He rewarded them with a laid-back set, that repurposed some of his earlier pop/rap hits with the \"yee-haw\" twang of his recent album F-1 Trillion.",
      "It all worked surprisingly well, although the eight-piece band occasionally overpowered his voice, and some fans were disappointed by the lack of hip-hop beats - saying the show would have been better suited to Coachella's sister festival Stagecoach (which is where Post launched his country phase last year).",
      "Surprisingly, the set was devoid of special guests, leading to speculation that the 29-year-old was holding fire for weekend two.",
      "As someone who's recently collaborated with Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Dolly Parton, that could definitely be worth staying up for.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 10:25pm on Sunday (local time), or 6:25am on Monday (UK time).",
      "6) Back to Black(pink)",
      "In 2019, Blackpink made history by becoming the first Korean group to headline Coachella. This year, two of its members - Lisa and Jennie - were back with dazzling solo sets, before the band reconvenes for a stadium tour in the summer.",
      "Lisa was up first, on Friday night, with a slick, highly-choreographed set that combined hard-edged rap cuts like Money and Lifestyle, with the softer sounds of Moonlit Floor and Dream.",
      "After her appearance in the third series of The White Lotus, she clarified that music is, in fact, her main job. Backstage, she held a post-mortem on the performance with her bandmate Ros\u00e9 (Conclusion: The desert wind makes it hard to sing).",
      "Jennie packed the Outdoor Theater on Sunday evening, for a set of clubby disco anthems that don't sound a million miles away from her friend and collaborator Dua Lipa.",
      "Highlights included the bombastic Like Jennie - produced by Diplo, and boasting it's own viral dance break -  and the swoonsome pop of Love Hangover, which showcased her vocal abilities.",
      "The 29-year-old has never been the most precise performer, but it somehow works to her advantage - making her more \"real\" than the imperious perfection of her peers.",
      "Watch Lisa on the Sahara Stage at 7:45pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45am on Saturday (UK time). Jennie plays the Outdoor Theatre at 7:45pm on Sunday (local time), or 3:45am on Monday (UK time).",
      "7) Brat Summer 2: Electric Boogaloo",
      "Charli XCX drew one of the weekend's biggest crowds, for a sleazy, hedonistic run-through of her sleazy, hedonistic breakout album, Brat.",
      "Performing entirely on her own, the star was in constant motion - a mesmerising blur of hip-rolls, hair tosses, stomach crunches and knee-drops, as she turned Coachella's main stage into sweat-drenched, laser-lit club night.",
      "Compared to the maximalism of other sets, it was a lesson in how one person can hold a stage on their own... Well, almost.",
      "At several points, she brought out her collaborators from Brat's companion album - Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Lorde. It was, one excitable fan commented, \"like The Avengers for gay people\".",
      "Whether the guest-list will be the same on Coachella's second weekend remains to be seen. But Charli is worth your time either way.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 7:15pm on Saturday (local time), or 3:15am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "8) Benson Boone vs d4vd",
      "Anyone who's had the pleasure of watching Benson Boone over the last year will know he's fond of performing a front flip off his piano, the big show off.",
      "He didn't let us down at Coachella - bouncing around the stage like a Duracell Bunny attached to a car battery. To cap it all off, he brought out Brian May for a surprisingly successful version of Bohemian Rhapsody.",
      "Less fortunate, however, was Texan singer d4vd, whose attempt at a backflip went disastrously wrong.",
      "Thankfully, he recovered in time to pull off an energetic set that highlighted the life-affirming vibes of his bedroom pop hits Feel It and What Are You Waiting For.",
      "After the set, he swore to practice harder for this weekend's performance. \"Imagine if I fall again,\" he cringed.",
      "Watch Benson Boone on the Coachella Stage at 7:05pm on Friday (local time), or 3:45 am on Saturday (UK Time). D4vd plays the Gobi Stage at 5:55pm on Friday (local time), or 1:55am on Saturday (UK time).",
      "9) Gustavo Dudamel's genre-defying live mixtape",
      "Last Saturday, the entire LA Philharmonic Orchestra boarded a bus and set off for the desert to make their Coachella debut.",
      "Under the baton of Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel, they performed what was billed as \"Gustavo's mixtape\" - moving seamlessly between classical standards like Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, and modern pop hits.",
      "For the latter, they were joined on stage by a host of A-list stars, including indie titan Beck, Icelandic songstress Laufey, country singer Maren Morris and rap icon LL Cool J.",
      "\"I told to the orchestra, 'I'm so happy conducting, but I wish I could be in the middle of the crowd and enjoy the moment,'\" Dudamel told Variety magazine ahead of the show.",
      "Weekend two will feature an all-new array of guest stars, he promised, but details are being kept under wraps for now.",
      "The LA Philharmonic plays the Outdoor Theatre at 6:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 2:25am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "10) T-Pain is the ultimate party starter",
      "\"It took me 20 years to get on this stage,\" said T-Pain towards the end of his set on Saturday, and he certainly made the most of his hour-long set.",
      "He covered Journey's Don't Stop Believin' and Chris Stapleton's country hit Tennessee Whiskey, while racing through early 2000s hits like Buy U A Drank and I'm In Luv, and revisiting his verses on Flo Rida's Low, and Kanye West's Good Life.",
      "For that, he received a hero's welcome, with the crowd treating his set as an excuse for some turn of the millennium escapism.",
      "By the time it ended, a campaign had started for T-Pain to play next year's Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Watch on the Coachella Stage at 5:25pm on Saturday (local time), or 1:25am on Sunday (UK time).",
      "Other sets worth watching",
      "Luckily, you're not forced to stay up all night to watch the stars strut their stuff in California.",
      "Coachella's generous livestreams repeat throughout the day, and you can rewind several hours to find the performances you want.",
      "Other highlights from the first weekend included Megan Thee Stallion, whose star-studded set included appearances from Queen Latifah, Victoria Mon\u00e9t, and Ciara; and Kraftwerk, reminding everyone that they essentially invented electronic music.",
      "Belinda Carlisle reunited with her old band The Go-Gos for a dose of sun-kissed 1980s nostalgia, and the UK's Sam Fender tore through a blistering set that showcased the songwriting chops of his new album, People Watching.",
      "Among the newcomers with main stage aspirations were South Africa's hip-swivelling R&B star Tyla, and New York dance act Fcukers, whose breakout hit Bon Bon was one of the weekend's most inescapable tracks.",
      "You can see the full line-up for Coachella's second weekend on the festival's website."

    "published": "Sat, 19 Apr 2025 01:03:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Wrestling's main event is to stream live on Netflix for the first time - here's why it matters.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of wrestling fans across the world are gearing up for this weekend's much-anticipated annual finale - WrestleMania 41.",
      "Just ask seven-year-old Oliver, who's spent the past week of his school holidays waking his dad, Paul, at 6:30 to eagerly count down the days.",
      "He's even being allowed to get up at midnight to watch it, because, as one of the 17 million UK households subscribed to Netflix, the family now has live ringside access to the two-night Las Vegas extravaganza.",
      "It means Oliver will finally get to find out if 16-time champion John Cena, who's recently flipped from hero to villain as part of his farewell tour (leaving Oliver in shock), can defeat Cody Rhodes in a record-breaking win before retirement.",
      "It's all part of a $5bn (\u00a34bn) mega-deal bringing World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) archive and biggest events to the streamer - with WrestleMania now available live on Netflix in many international territories for the very first time. US viewers, however, will still be watching on NBC's Peacock, at least for now.",
      "The 10-year contract, which began earlier this year, connects WWE with a potential global audience of 700 million. It's central to WWE chief content officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque's vision of making wrestling globally accessible and relevant to a new generation of streaming era fans.",
      "The stakes are high. WrestleMania, which began in 1985, is being treated as a litmus test - not just for WWE's global expansion, but for Netflix's potential move into live sports.",
      "But will this blockbuster tag-team partnership pay off, or will it prove one (very) expensive fight too far?",
      "On-demand chokehold",
      "The Netflix/WWE deal reflects changes in viewing habits, and also speaks to WWE's eagerness to be promoted by the \"winner of the streaming wars\", the Wrestlenomics website editor Brandon Thurston tells the BBC.",
      "After years of relying on cable pay-per-view  - which charged US viewers a hefty $60 (\u00a345) per event - WWE launched its own network in 2014. The company took most of its pay-per-view events in house, aware that half the revenue was being lost to satellite companies.",
      "The move paid off, says Thurston, as prices for pay-per-view events dropped significantly to around $10 (\u00a37.50), creating \"a larger audience than ever\".",
      "The Netflix deal is, according to Thurston, part of WWE's plans to recruit globally, create bigger international stars, and amplify its live tournaments such as Raw, WrestleMania and Smackdown across different markets.",
      "As WWE's Levesque told the Ankler podcast, Netflix's universal \"simplicity\" felt game-changing: \"No matter where you are in the globe, there it is right in front of you. It's one click, and you're on and you're in\".",
      "Good thing too, as Levesque says younger audiences have \"no concept\" of traditional television, and increasingly view on-demand streaming as the norm, alongside video platforms like YouTube and TikTok.",
      "It's certainly made Oliver a megafan, and he is now able to watch the weekly Smackdown and Raw shows with his dad. Previously, without a TNT sport subscription, his options were limited to the monthly events available on the WWE network.",
      "\"Now that WWE is on Netflix, he watches it probably four times a week. It's his go-to programme,\" says Paul.",
      "\"It's really opened up a huge door for him. What's great for me as a dad is I used to be into wrestling when I was his age as well, so it's nice to share that journey with him\".",
      "And he's far from alone. On Thursday, industry magazine Broadcast reported that the move to Netflix had significantly increased UK engagement with both shows, with Raw ranked among the platform's top 10 shows in nine of its first 10 weeks.",
      "The picture is less clear in the US. Back in February, Mark Shapiro, a chief at WWE parent company TKO, told investors that Raw viewership was up 13% for the year to date compared to its previous home on USA Network - rising to 38% if the heavily promoted opening night is included.",
      "However, Thurston's research suggests that Raw and Smackdown viewership has since levelled off to numbers seen on USA.",
      "And figures are continuing to fall, not to an alarming amount, but certainly indicating that, potentially, weekly events on the streamer may not be as much of a growth area as major live events.",
      "Regardless, he sees the trade-off as worth it for Netflix in the long run - particularly looking ahead to WrestleMania's global debut tonight, which is expected to break streaming records.",
      "'Boots on the ground'",
      "When former longtime WWE CEO Vince McMahon dreamt up WrestleMania more than 40 years ago, he envisaged a Superbowl-style set piece event to unite the franchise's commercial partnerships and burrow it deeper within popular culture.",
      "That's why 1985's first WrestleMania was heavily promoted through MTV and held at New York's Madison Square Garden - featuring everyone from wrestler Hulk Hogan to A-team actor Mr T, popstar Cyndi Lauper and Muhammad Ali as a referee.",
      "\"We were trying to make a statement as to what our business is,\" McMahon told Netflix's 2024 docuseries, \"all forms of entertainment rolled into one\".",
      "And yet despite turning WWE into a media empire, McMahon departed in disgrace - first in 2022 and then again in 2024, amid various controversies - including an ongoing sexual harassment lawsuit. McMahon's attorney, Jessica Rosenberg, denied the claims.",
      "Thurston feels McMahon's tight grip on creative business decisions also stifled WWE's storytelling in later years. Under Levesque, Thurston says that's changed in favour of collaboration. He says stories feel fresher, gender representation has improved and US event attendance is up.",
      "For Jonny Pivaral, who grew up watching during what he calls McMahon's \"bra and panties match\" era of the 2000s, the evolution is welcome. \"Back then, women were just eye candy,\" he says. \"Now they're being showcased on the same level as the men.\"",
      "This shift will be on full display when women's wrestling storylines take centre stage at WrestleMania.

      "Dean assured him: \"They know the plan. We're still married so what's mine is hers. So it makes no difference.\"",
      "The amount Lord Sugar invests has remained the same since 2011, and previous winner Tom Pellereau - the first to receive that sum - said: \"Fourteen years ago, \u00a3250,000 went quite a lot further than it does today.",

    "story": [
      "After British actress Aimee Lou Wood called a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that impersonated her using exaggerated prosthetic teeth \"mean and unfunny,\" impressionists have told BBC News how they tread the line between being funny and offensive.",
      "It all began with five minutes on NBC last Saturday night.",
      "Titled The White Potus - a spin on hit HBO dark comedy The White Lotus - a SNL sketch depicted US president Donald Trump, his family and top team spending time at a fictional tropical hotel.",
      "After jokes showing Eric Trump blending a gold Rolex watch and Ivanka Trump rejecting a spiritual call to give up material wealth, Wood's White Lotus character Chelsea is portrayed by cast member Sarah Sherman using a pronounced accent and large teeth.",
      "In response to a comment made by a character playing US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, she asks: \"Fluoride? What's that?\"",
      "The mineral is added to some water supplies and brands of toothpaste to help prevent tooth decay.",
      "'Bit of a cheap shot'",
      "For BBC Radio 4's Dead Ringers star Jan Ravens, the first misstep of the writers behind the SNL sketch was \"not reading the room\".",
      "It was a bad idea to joke about someone's appearance in a sketch about The White Lotus, Ravens says, given Wood's casting has been praised for a character lacking \"those all-American, fake-looking teeth\".",
      "\"In the wake of all that, she's been talking about how she was bullied at school and the butt of jokes. So then you think, 'why would you do that joke'?\"",
      "It meant that in making fun of Wood's appearance, the sketch \"punched down,\" says Ravens.",
      "\"You might make a joke about Donald Trump's appearance because you're definitely not punching down on the most powerful man in the western world.\"",
      "Ronni Ancona, co-writer and star of the early 2000s TV series The Big Impression, said she \"could see\" that the writers were also trying to make a point about US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's pledge to remove fluoride from US drinking water.",
      "But in doing so, \"they would have made this tenuous link between fluoride and Aimee Lou's teeth. It's a bit of a cheap shot,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "After the show aired, Wood, 31, said she was \"not thin skinned\" and understood that SNL was about \"caricature\".",
      "\"But the whole joke was about fluoride,\" she wrote on Sunday. \"I have big gap teeth not bad teeth.\"",
      "Later on, in a post on social media, she said: \"I've had apologies from SNL.\"",
      "However, Francine Lewis, a comedian whose impersonations have earned her a large following on social media, says the whole purpose of the US show is to \"take the mick\".",
      "While she can sympathise with someone being \"embarrassed\" by being the target of a sketch, Lewis adds that she thinks Wood's response was \"too sensitive\".",
      "In her own impressions of celebrities, which include TV stars Gemma Collins and Stacey Solomon, Lewis has stuffed a pillow up her top to appear to be physically larger and put cotton wool on her teeth \"to make them really white and jut out a bit\".",
      "In recent times, both fans and some of her targets have taken offence.",
      "\"I don't know if it's just the new generation of young people that just take offence to every little thing,\" she says.",
      "\"People that say you're a troll, you're a bully... I find myself hiding at celebrity events because I think 'oh I do their impression, they might not like me'.\"",
      "But she believes that being impersonated is actually a marker of someone's popularity and fame, saying that \"it means you've arrived\".",
      "Rather than adapting her impressions, Lewis is steadfast in her belief that \"to make comedy funny, unfortunately you have to overstep the mark.\"",
      "'Got to have the mickey taken'",
      "It's a view shared by Steve Nallon, known for impersonating former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on satirical TV programme Spitting Image.",
      "\"What caricaturists do by nature... is exaggerate the physicality. If a caricaturist is stopped from doing that, there's no point in him being a caricaturist,\" he says.",
      "During the 1980s, one of his targets - former Labour minister Roy Hattersley - was mocked for a slight speech impediment, with water spurting out of his mouth as he spoke.",
      "\"The joke was Roy Hattersley spits,\" says Nallon, who adds that Hattesley allegedly got on board with the joke after initially taking offence.",
      "For Nallon, those in the public eye will always be fair game. \"Maybe it's not a bad lesson to learn that you've got to have the mickey taken out of you occasionally,\" he says.",
      "But times have changed. Ravens says that \"people are much more sensitive\" about targeting certain aspects of people's appearances and mannerisms \"than they used to be earlier on in my career, for example, and I think rightly so\".",
      "This is not the first time SNL has received criticism of their portrayals.",
      "It doesn't mean the comedy is lost, says Ravens. In political satire - which was the main thrust of the SNL sketch - a really good impression satirises what the person is saying, rather than just fixating on how they look or how they deliver it, she adds.",
      "During our phone interview, she seamlessly breaks into an impression of former UK Prime Minister Theresa May, but notes that just speaking in a tense, clipped way, \"is only good for one line really\".",
      "\"You're pricking pomposity and you're exposing hypocrisy. That's the point of satire.\"",

    "summary": "Portraying some of the most famous people on the planet has its challenges, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Playing any well-known figure from recent history is a challenge, but the challenge of finding four actors to put in convincing portrayals of four of the most famous people in popular culture is one not many directors have attempted.",
      "Earlier this month, director Sam Mendes announced the cast for his four-part Beatles biopic, with each member of the band set to be the subject of their own feature-length films set for release in 2028.",
      "Actors Harris Dickinson, Paul Mescal, Joseph Quinn and Barry Keoghan will play John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr respectively.",
      "Their performances \u2013 and particularly their efforts at the Beatles' distinctive accents \u2013 will be closely watched by fans the world over. And if previous actors' attempts are anything to go by, they should brace themselves for some serious scrutiny.",
      "'Suspend disbelief'",
      "Perhaps one of the most famous and successful Beatles biopics is 1994's Backbeat, set in the band's 1960-1962 Hamburg era.",
      "On the one hand, it had Liverpool actor Ian Hart turning in a convincing Lennon (even if he was not exactly Lennon's double).",
      "But on the other, Hollywood actor Stephen Dorff, playing the film's lead character of original Beatles bass player and artist Stuart Sutcliffe, who died of a brain haemorrhage aged just 21, provided an uncanny likeness. But his attempt at the Liverpool accent has received, over the years since, reviews from \"decent\" to \"variable\" to \"awful\".",
      "So should any actor taking on a Beatle role be wary?",
      "Beatles historian Paul Du Noyer, who wrote The Beatles: The Complete Illustrated Story and Conversations With Paul McCartney, said: \"The Beatles are so well known to us all, not just their faces but every nuance of the way they talk, every mannerism.",
      "\"Many of us know the Beatles as well as we know our own families. It can be difficult for us to suspend the disbelief.",
      "\"Even when I've seen performances that were very good, for example Ian Hart in Backbeat, that got around the problem of the familiarity by dwelling on a lesser-known period of their story.\"",
      "Du Noyer added that some Beatles might seem easier to take off than others.",
      "\"In some ways, you stick a wig and a beard on someone, little round granny glasses and a white suit and everyone goes, 'It's John Lennon'\"",
      "But he said McCartney was a tougher portrayal to nail \u2013 especially when the man himself is a tough critic.",
      "\"Paul has been very critical of films like [Sam Taylor-Wood's early years biopic of John Lennon] Nowhere Boy, and Backbeat, because they tend to fall into a pastiche of McCartney that he doesn't recognise \u2013 he doesn't like the stereotype of him being the cute one, the manipulative one.\"",
      "So does Sam Mendes have a job on his hands?",
      "Du Noyer added: \"He's got bankable stars, who won't let themselves down. I know there's been some disappointment among Liverpudlians because non-Liverpudlians have been cast in the roles, but even as a loyal Liverpudlian I can't condemn Sam Mendes on the casting, because he is making films for the whole world to watch.",
      "\"I think the accuracy of the Liverpool accent will be pretty low down the list of things he needs to cover.\"",
      "'Don't hear it any more'",
      "Edda Sharpe, a Merseyside-based voice and dialect coach who has worked with actors at the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre, said there were some specific challenges to taking on the voice of a Beatle.",
      "Among them is the fact that the accent with which John, Paul, George and Ringo spoke is much less pronounced than the one many might associate with Liverpool today.",
      "Beatles aficionados will know that on the Let It Be album version of the old Liverpool folk tune Maggie May, Lennon deliberately exaggerated the Liverpool accent, elongating his vowels and adding a much more nasal quality to it.",
      "The performance has more in common with today's Scouse accent than it did with the one the Beatles spoke with.",
      "\"And the challenge is, the way the Beatles spoke, you just don't hear that any more. It's a completely different tone to the Liverpool accent we are currently exposed to,\" Sharpe said.",
      "\"And you are not just trying to create the sound of someone from Liverpool in the 1960s, you are trying to create the sound of people that everyone is familiar with.\"",
      "She said there might be advantages for Irish actors Mescal and Keoghan, as there are certain common traits to both Liverpool and Irish accents.",
      "But she said similarities in accent could also prove problematic for actors.",
      "\"The northern Irish accent, particularly, has this sort of down-and-then-up quality, and when you listen to early recordings of the Beatles you hear what sounds like a familiar Irish pattern.",
      "\"But sometimes accents that are closer to your own are harder to do than ones that are completely different.\"",
      "'More Scouse'",
      "Dr Paul Cooper, a senior lecturer in English Language at the University of Liverpool, said there was academic research to back up the idea that \"Scouse was getting more Scouse\" than it used to be in the time of the Beatles.",
      "He said research by linguistics expert Marten Juskan into the changing sound of the Scouse accent supported the claim.",
      "\"Also,\" said Cooper, \"I think younger people are now looking at the accent more favourably than maybe it was looked at 30 or 40 years ago.",
      "\"There's always been a strong sense of pride in the accent, but I think in the 1980s and 1990s you got the Harry Enfield Scousers stuff and it maybe became viewed a bit more negatively.",
      "\"I think now it's viewed a bit more favourably again. Plus, Liverpool is much more of a tourist destination now, and the accent is thought of as very welcoming and very friendly.\"",
      "But what does an actor who has taken on not one but two Beatle roles think the challenge will be for the actors taking on the Fab Four in Mendes' films?",
      "Michael Hawkins played John Lennon in the successful stage show Cilla: The Musical based on the life and career of Liverpool entertainer Cilla Black, and, in his first TV role, George Harrison in the 2014 ITV serial biopic Cilla, with Sheridan Smith taking the title role.",
      "Hawkins said: \"You've got to do your research, watch as much stuff as you can.",
      "\"Obviously in the films like Hard Days Night they're sort of playing a version of themselves, but with the Get Back film, you see more of them as how they were.",
      "\"So many people feel like they know them so well that if you get something a little off, it'll make people wince.",
      "\"It's about getting the authenticity, and not doing a caricature.\"",
      "The 35-year-old, a member of \"parody band\" Ugly Baby, said even as a born-and-bred Scouser he was not immune from scrutiny for his portrayal of Harrison in Cilla.",
      "He added: \"I didn't really change my accent much for playing George. And then one of my mates sent me a review, from the Mirror, I think it was, where they were saying George's accent was just a general northern one, with no hint of the 'Pool.",
      "\"And I was the only Scouser out of the four of us.\"",

      "Speaking about her experience of being a celebrity she added: \"When you go on a talk show, or even here now, and then you see soundbites of things you've said, pulled out and italicised, they sound really loud. I'm not that person.",
      "\"I make more sense in motion - it's been a long time to remotely get comfortable with the idea of being photographed.\"",
      "Her remarks echoed comments she made to BBC Radio 4's This Natural Life last year, when she said she \"absolutely loved\" acting, but also said it would be \"brilliant\" to give it up and spoke about her passion for nature and conservation.",
      "Blanchett is best known for appearing in films such as T\u00e1r, Notes on a Scandal and Elizabeth: The Golden Age, and won Oscars for her performances in Blue Jasmine and The Aviator.",
      "She wouldn't be the first successful actor to switch careers slightly later in life. Here are 10 other actors who retired from acting (including a few who came back):",
      "1. Cameron Diaz",
      "The US actress was one of Hollywood's biggest stars in the 90s and 00s, having made her debut at the age of 21 opposite Jim Carey in The Mask more than 30 years ago.",
      "Initially finding fame for her goofy performances in romcoms such as My Best Friend's wedding, and comedies including There's Something About Mary, Diaz went on to prove her dramatic acting chops in movies like Being John Malkovich and Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York.",
      "But she took a hiatus from Hollywood following her turn as Ms Hannigan in 2014's remake of the musical Annie, confirming her \"retirement\" in 2018. \"I was free to be [like] 'I'm a mum, I'm a wife, I'm living my life' - it was so lovely.\"",
      "She said the decade she spent in retirement from acting was \"the best 10 years\" of her life. But she was eventually persuaded to return to screens earlier this year for spy thriller Back in Action with actor Jamie Foxx.",
      "2. Daniel Day-Lewis",
      "The Oscar-winning star, considered one of his generation's finest actors, apparently retired in 2017, but it wasn't the first time he had stepped away from the spotlight.",
      "Day-Lewis, who holds both British and Irish citizenship, has won an incredible three best actor Academy Awards for roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln.",
      "Known for leaving long stretches between roles, in the 1990s Day-Lewis went into what he called \"semi-retirement\" and became a shoemaker's apprentice in Florence, Italy.",
      "He was coaxed back to acting by Martin Scorsese and his offer of the role in Gangs of New York.",
      "A statement issued through the star's agent in 2017, when he was aged 60, said he \"will no longer be working as an actor\".",
      "Again, however, that proved not to be permanent. Day-Lewis is soon to star in Anemone, the debut feature film from his son Ronan Day-Lewis. Daniel and Ronan co-wrote the script which \"explores the intricate relationships between fathers, sons and brothers, and the dynamics of familial bonds\".",
      "Whether it's a one-off due to the family connection or the start of a big return to film remains to be seen.",
      "3. Jack Nicholson",
      "Nicholson is one of only three actors (including Day-Lewis, above) to have won three Academy Awards for acting. Two of Nicholson's were for best actor (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and As Good As It Gets) and another for best supporting actor (Terms of Endearment).",
      "The legendary star's other famous roles include Easy Rider, The Shining, The Departed, A Few Good Men and Batman.",
      "Although he's never formally announced he is quitting or retiring, he previously said his retreat from the spotlight was brought on by a desire to not \"be out there anymore\".",
      "His last film role was in 2010 romcom How Do You Know.",
      "But just last week, that film's director James L Brooks told Hollywood Reporter: \"I wouldn't be surprised to see Jack work again. I mean, it's been a hunk of time but I don't know. Maybe it could be the right thing. He's reading scripts all the time, I think.\"",
      "4. Greta Garbo",
      "Legendary Swedish screen siren Greta Garbo declared in 1941 at the ripe old age of 36 that she would be taking a \"temporary\" retirement.",
      "It proved to be permanent. The Camille and Queen Christina star never appeared on film again.",
      "Always the reluctant celebrity, the reclusive actress never played the Hollywood game, refusing interviews and avoiding film premieres and other public appearances.",
      "The enigmatic star, whose famous line \"I want to be alone\" from Grand Hotel somewhat mirrored her desire in real life as well as on screen, only succeeded in increasing her mystique by stepping away from the spotlight.",
      "However, she later clarified in an interview: \"I never said: 'I want to be alone.' I only said, 'I want to be let alone! There is all the difference'.\"",
      "One of the few silent movie stars to transition successfully to the \"talkies\", Garbo moved away from Hollywood to New York, where she lived until her death in 1990 at the age of 84.",
      "5. Sean Connery",
      "Synonymous with James Bond, the late Scottish star first found fame through modelling and body-building before landing a few small theatre and TV roles.",
      "He made his film debut in No Road Back in 1957, but playing Secret Intelligence Service agent 007 in Dr No a few years later gave him his big breakthrough. He went on to star in five further Bond movies including From Russia with Love and Goldfinger.",
      "Connery appeared in numerous other films over his long career, including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie, The Man Who Would Be King opposite Sir Michael Caine, The Untouchables (for which he won an Oscar) and The Hunt for Red October. But he would forever be wedded to 007.",
      "In 2005, however, he said he was \"fed up with the idiots\" adding there was an \"ever-widening gap between people who know how to make movies and the people who greenlight the movies.\"",
      "That declaration came a couple of years after he starred in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which many concluded was one of the main reasons for his retirement.",
      "The poorly received comic book caper was to be his final screen appearance.",
      "6. Rick Moranis",
      "Kids of the 80s and 90s: You know. This guy was a huge star back in the day, the comedy backbone of popular films such as Ghostbusters, Honey I Shrunk The Kids and the musical Little Shop of Horrors (Suddenly, Seymour anyone?).",

      "He began to cut back on work after his wife died of cancer in 1991 to concentrate on raising his children, with his final big screen outing being the 1997 sequel Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves.",
      "\"I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the travelling involved in making movies,\" he told USA Today in 2005.",
      "\"So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.\"",
      "He did continue to do voiceover work, however, and Moranis was set to make a comeback in a Honey I Shrunk the Kids reboot, which sadly fell through.",
      "7. Gene Hackman",
      "We sadly lost this acting legend earlier this year, along with his second wife Betsy Arakawa, but the star hadn't been seen on screen for years after retiring from the profession on the advice of his heart doctor - opting for a quiet life in New Mexico.",
      "Hackman shot to fame in Bonnie and Clyde at the end of the 60s and was rarely out of work - in films like The French Connection, Mississippi Burning and Superman.",
      "He chose to bow out from acting in the political satire Welcome to Mooseport in 2004.",
      "Explaining his decision, he told Reuters that he didn't want to risk going out on a sour note.",
      "\"The business for me is very stressful. The compromises that you have to make in films are just part of the beast,\" he said, \"and it had gotten to a point where I just didn't feel like I wanted to do it any more.\"",
      "8. Bridget Fonda",
      "Fonda, from the famous family dynasty, is another star who quit at the height of her fame.",
      "Starring in 80s and 90s hits such as Scandal (about the Profumo Affair), Cameron Crowe's Singles, The Godfather Part III and Single White Female (everyone wanted to copy that elfin crop, not just Jennifer Jason Leigh). And then... nothing.",
      "Fonda never formally retired, she just seemed to retreat. Her last big screen appearance was in The Whole Shebang in 2001.",
      "When asked in 2023 by a reporter if she would return to acting at some point, she replied: \"I don't think so, it's too nice being a civilian.\" Fair enough!",
      "Fonda's aunt Jane also quit acting in 1990 for several years, explaining later in Vogue that \"she wasn't having fun anymore\".",
      "But she later came out of retirement for the romcom movie Monster-in-Law.",
      "\"It was just a gut feeling of, Why the hell not? It'd been 15 years, and I wanted to act again.\"",
      "9. Shelley Duvall",
      "Another star we sadly lost in the last year, Shelley Duval was best known for her roles in film like The Shining, Annie Hall and Nashville.",
      "Her step back from the spotlight wasn't just her choice. Movie roles began to drop off in the 90s and then she decided to move back to Texas after her brother was diagnosed with cancer.",
      "A year before her death, she told People magazine: \"It's the longest sabbatical I ever took but it was for really important reasons - to get in touch with my family again.\"",

      "10. Ke Huy Quan",
      "Who could forget 2024 award season's most charming star, Oscar winner and Everything, Everywhere All At Once actor Ke Huy Quan?",
      "He first found fame as a child actor in the 80s when he landed the role of Short Round in Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, before taking another starring role in childhood adventure hit The Goonies.",
      "A couple of TV roles followed but then the work largely dried up, and he settled for working behind the scenes as a stunt co-ordinator and assistant director.",
      "\"It's always difficult to make the transition from a child actor to an adult actor,\" he told the Telegraph. \"But when you're Asian, then it's 100 times more difficult.\"",
      "He reluctantly gave up - only due to lack of opportunity - and it took years before he took a punt on inventive, off-the wall movie Everything, Everywhere, All At Once, where his role as Waymond Wang won him an Oscar and made him a Hollywood darling once again.",

    "story": [
      "The Lady, Britain's longest-running women's magazine, has formally announced that it has ceased publication.",
      "The magazine is famed for its etiquette advice and adverts for butlers, nannies and discreet liaisons with well-heeled 60-somethings.",
      "In a statement, the publishers confirmed recent media reports that the April edition of the magazine will be the last, but added that the website with its jobs board and recruitment agency will continue.",
      "Here's a look back at its place in, and impact on, British culture over 140 years.",
      "The 'whole field of womanly action'",
      "The Lady was established in 1885 by Thomas Gibson Bowles, as a magazine for gentlewomen, a weekly guide to navigating the social minefield of well-to-do British life.",
      "Its very distinctive character was affectionately lampooned by PG Wodehouse. In his Jeeves stories, Bertie Wooster is briefly employed by a magazine called Milady's Boudoir, which was housed \"in one of those rummy streets in the Covent Garden neighbourhood\".",
      "The real Lady Magazine just happened to be in Bedford Street in Covent Garden.",
      "The Lady's fame owed much to its advice to women on the mysteries of the British class system. In 1936, for instance, its readers were given an update on the acceptability of novels.",
      "\"The reading of fiction, not long ago thought deplorable by nearly all social workers, is now becoming almost a virtue,\" it noted.",
      "Its first edition began with an explanation that its objective was to cover \"the whole field of womanly action\".",
      "Almost all of it was written by a man - Bowles - using various aliases. It was not a huge success. Fortunes changed in 1894 when he appointed his children's governess, Rita Shell, to be editor.",
      "'How to sack a servant'",
      "Under Shell's control, it became a successful weekly guide to women who found themselves in charge of both a household and a budget to outsource the daily drudgery to the lower classes.",
      "In December 1927, it cautioned young women \"to become a good cook before you marry, darling. Then you will be competent to rebuke a staff of domestics or to dispense with one\".",
      "Eighty years later, those concerns remained central. Editor Rachel Johnson was a firm believer in not being too familiar with staff, writing: \"Never sit in the kitchen chatting to your nanny, it'll end in tears before bedtime.\"",
      "And even today there are still pages of classified adverts for livery workers and other assorted varieties of domestic help but the demand now is more for live-in carers for the elderly than butlers or nannies.",
      "Rebranding The Lady",
      "That age profile has long been a concern. In 2009, Johnson was taken on to give the magazine a more youthful rebrand. She was asked to halve the average of the reader, which was, when she started, 78.",
      "A Channel 4 documentary revealed it was not universally welcomed, and Johnson's diaries later catalogued all the difficulties of aiming articles at  younger readers amongst adverts for walk-in baths and absorbent underwear along with products to remove their associated odours. It was an eventful three years that made more than a few headlines.",
      "Nevertheless, while the readership did briefly increase, like most print magazines, sales have been in sharp decline in recent years. Once a weekly, it went from fortnightly to monthly. The last published figures in 2023 revealed it sold just under 18,000 copies an issue.",
      "Custard creams in the safe",
      "And while the website will continue, it is the end of the line for a very distinctive bit of British culture.",
      "The current owner of The Lady is the great grandson of the founder, Thomas Bowles. Ben Budworth has spent 17 years trying to keep it afloat.",
      "He took over the running of the magazine in 2008 and oversaw the controversial rebrand. His decision to sell off the Covent Garden offices and move production to a business park in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire was met with protest.",
      "The premises on Bedford Street were seen by many of the staff as more than just another office, they helped define The Lady's character.",
      "No-one had a direct phone line. Instead, calls all went through a telephonist. One former editor said work would stop at 2pm to listen to the Archers, and again at 3:30pm for tea.",
      "Johnson said the wall safe was where the tins of custard creams were stored. One particular perk was her own peach-coloured WC. Each day she would be handed two freshly laundered towels.",
      "The building was a reminder of its long history and the magazine's many contributors, among them Lewis Carroll, Nancy Mitford and Stella Gibbons, who while giving the impression of being hard at work wrote Cold Comfort Farm in the magazine's offices.",
      "The L word",
      "However, heritage does not pay bills. Problems with a tax demand made headlines in 2024 and suggested the move to Hertfordshire had not solved the financial woes.   The problem of the shrinking and ageing readership was never going away.",
      "Even the word lady has shifted over the years from being an aspiration to a term widely regarded as demeaning and disparaging.",
      "And while there are older magazines, such as The People's Friend (which did not begin as a magazine aimed specifically at women) and the American Harper's Bazaar, which absorbed the even older British stalwart Queen, the Lady has a good claim on being the UK's oldest surviving women's magazine.",
      "However, 140 years on, a magazine that once billed itself as an indispensable guide to society has found that society has moved on."

      "Michelle Collins has been acting since she was 18.",
      "But after more than four decades on stage and screen, in shows such as Calendar Girls, Eastenders and Doctor Who, even she wasn't prepared for the fear of making her debut at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.",
      "\"I keep thinking to myself 'what on earth am I doing?' I don't need to do this, and I have to admit it's absolutely terrifying,\" she says.",
      "Her show Motorhome Marilyn is based on a passing glimpse of a real person she encountered years ago on the streets of Los Angeles.",
      "\"I saw this woman coming out of a motorhome near the place where the stars are on the pavement,\" says Collins. \"She was dressed as Marilyn Monroe, in a white halterneck dress, and she popped some money in the parking meter.",
      "\"It was the strangest image. I never saw her again but I never forgot her.\"",
      "Collins, who is best known for her portrayal of Cindy Beale in Eastenders, began turning that one moment into a play about an aspiring actress with an obsessive interest in Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe.",
      "She worked with writer and actor Stewart Permutt, who she met through festival veteran and friend Miriam Margolyes.",
      "\"I found a producer, we decided to take it to Edinburgh, we had a venue, we made posters and a short trailer for the show,\" she says.",
      "\"And then Covid happened.\"",
      "The festival was cancelled in 2020 and greatly curtailed the following year. Everything went on hold.",
      "Sadly, Permutt died last year. But he left his literary estate, including the first draft of Motorhome Marilyn, to Collins.",
      "\"He was insistent we should take it to Edinburgh as planned,\" she says.",
      "\"His name is still on the posters as well as Ben Weatherill who has taken it on.\"",
      "That attitude to get the show on whatever the odds is at the heart of the Fringe.",
      "Motorhome Marilyn is one of 1,792 shows announced so far for this August, which also marks the debut of Tony Lankester as CEO of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Society, the organisation which runs the festival.",
      "He first visited Edinburgh in 2007 on a British Council tour, when he was running the South African National Arts Festival.",
      "\"It became evident to me that this was the gold standard for festivals wherever you are in the world, even on the tip of Africa,\" he says.",
      "Back then, his was one of seven fringe festivals which had begun working together to further their common aims. Today, more than 300 festivals from around the world are linked in a new network, and he says the advice they share is vital.",
      "\"It can be a lonely job running a festival,\" he adds. \"Just the comfort of knowing that on your phone is a person who is going through the same thing.",
      "\"Whether you're running a festival in Toronto or Prague or Adelaide the issues are the same and the ambitions are the same.\"",
      "Having been in the job only a week, he says he's keen to listen and learn before making any changes.",
      "And he says his previous job at London's Riverside Studios, which he took up just weeks before the pandemic began, gave him a better understanding of the fragility of the sector.",
      "\"When I stepped into the role I inherited a huge amount of debt, we had to go into administration but we emerged from that largely intact,\" he says. \"Covid continues to hang over everything we do. We have to be a lot more pragmatic and we can't take anything for granted.\"",
      "He says that includes the Edinburgh Fringe.",
      "\"A lot of the time, public bodies take the big events that happen on their doorsteps for granted. They assume they're always going to be there and post covid we can assume nothing.\"",
      "Lankester is confident the Fringe Society has \"a seat at the table\" in discussions with Edinburgh City Council over controversial local issues such as the tourist tax and short-term letting.",
      "The August festivals have come in for a lot of scrutiny in recent years due to their effect on the letting sector in the capital.",
      "The sheer scale of the festival both benefits and strains the resources of the city. But for Lankester, it's all a question of perspective.",
      "\"We can't necessarily fix Edinburgh's accommodation crisis ourselves but we need to be there when it is under discussion,\" he says.",
      "\"The scale of the Edinburgh Fringe is staggering. It's a mammoth event and has huge impact but the approach I've always taken is to not focus on the big number.",
      "\"It's not about the 2.7 million tickets you sell, it's about the one ticket you sell and one person's experience of the festival because that's what's important.",
      "\"No matter how bad the world is, how much the conversation is about economic issues, the artists are still stepping up creating new, fresh, interesting work and we're enormously proud to create this platform for them,\" he says.",

      "Sean John Combs was born in Harlem and raised in Mount Vernon, New York.",
      "His mother, Janice, was a teacher's assistant, while his father Melvin was a former member of the US Air Force who became an associate of the drug-trafficker Frank Lucas, who later inspired the Ridley Scott film American Gangster.",
      "In 1972, Melvin was fatally shot in his car during a drug transaction after being misidentified as an informant. Combs was just two, although he didn't learn the circumstances of his father's death until much later.",

      "As a teenager, he danced in music videos for artists such as Diana Ross and the Fine Young Cannibals.",
      "Taking a cue from his mother, who worked multiple jobs to support Sean and his sister Keisha, he also worked six separate newspaper delivery routes, before enrolling to study business administration at Howard University.",
      "Early 1990s: Party plans turn into tragedy",
      "At university, Mr Combs gained a reputation for throwing lavish parties, some of which attracted more than a thousand guests.",
      "After booking musicians such as Heavy D and Terry Riley to play at these gigs, he came to the attention of Uptown Records' founder Andre Harrell, who gave him an internship in New York.",
      "Mr Combs eventually dropped out of university to work there full-time, guiding the early careers of artists including Mary J Blige and Jodeci.",
      "However, tragedy struck in 1991, when Mr Combs co-promoted a celebrity basketball game and concert at City College of New York. Nearly 5,000 people showed up to the gymnasium, which could only fit 2,730 people. In the ensuing crush, nine people died and 29 people were injured.",
      "An inquiry by the New York Mayor's Office cited Mr Combs for hiring inexperienced security guards. However, the star and his lawyers maintained he was not responsible for security at the event.",
      "\"City College is something I deal with every day of my life,\" the musician said in 1998. \"But the things that I deal with can in no way measure up to the pain that the families deal with. I just pray for the families and pray for the children who lost their lives every day.\"",
      "No criminal charges were filed over the tragedy, but family members of the people who died sued the promoters, the college and the city, accusing them of negligence.",
      "The case was settled for $3.8m (\u00a33m), of which Mr Combs paid $750,000.",

      "But his relationship with Harrell broke down and Mr Combs was fired. He retaliated by setting up his own label, Bad Boy Records, and taking Biggie with him.",
      "The star's debut album, Ready To Die, was hailed as an all-time rap classic, selling millions of copies and generating the multi-platinum singles Juicy and Big Poppa.",
      "Mr Combs quickly expanded the Bad Boy roster, releasing hit albums by Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112 and Total.",
      "The label's sound was slick and polished. Its biggest singles lifted chunky samples from well-known hits. The practice was frowned upon by hip-hop purists, but it was catnip to radio programmers.",

      "But there was trouble, too. In May 1999, Mr Combs was arrested on suspicion of assaulting Interscope Records executive Steve Stoute, after a disagreement over a music video. He pleaded guilty to harassment and was sentenced to a one-day anger management class, external.",

      "Her self-titled debut was released in 2008 and its futuristic, space-age R&B proved to be a hit with critics.",
      "By that stage, Mr Combs and Ventura were in a relationship. But in a civil lawsuit filed in December 2023, she said the mogul had used his position of power to \"set the groundwork\" for a \"manipulative and coercive romantic and sexual relationship\".",
      "Her lawsuit included multiple graphic descriptions of violent abuse, alleging that Mr Combs \"regularly beat and kicked Ms Ventura, leaving black eyes, bruises, and blood\".",
      "Ventura also alleged sexual abuse and rape, and claimed that many of these incidents were witnessed by Mr Combs' \"tremendously loyal network\" who \"were not willing to do anything meaningful\" to stop the violence.",
      "Mr Combs strenuously denied the allegations and accused Ventura of trying to extort him. They settled the case a day after it was filed in New York, with Mr Combs' lawyer saying the settlement was \"in no way an admission of wrongdoing\".",
      "2007-2024: Business ventures",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4v7vj039o",
    "published": "Sun, 20 Apr 2025 00:04:43 GMT",
    "summary": "Blind influencer Lucy Edwards on choosing IVF which will screen out the gene that made her who she is.",
    "story": [
      "Blind content creator and TikTok star Lucy Edwards says she's \"so excited\" to be on a health kick to undergo IVF for gene editing purposes, but reveals the dilemma she faced in deciding to screen out the very gene that made her blind.",
      "\"I'm so broody,\" the 29-year-old tells the BBC Access All podcast.",
      "Lucy and her husband Ollie married at Kew Gardens two years ago and are now ready to start a family - but there are complications to consider.",
      "Lucy has the rare genetic condition Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) and lost her sight due to this aged 17, just months after meeting Ollie.",
      "The condition runs through the female line - Lucy's mum has IP although isn't blind, her Grandma did too and her great-aunt was blind in one eye.",
      "Lucy is totally blind, but, if she had been a boy, she may not have survived.",
      "The abnormal IP gene is located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while males have X and Y, meaning the appearance of the gene can be more catastrophic in male pregnancies.",
      "\"My grandma actually had nine miscarriages,\" Lucy says.",
      "This is one of the facts that played into the complicated decision Lucy and Ollie made to opt for pre-implantation genetic testing, a special type of IVF where embryos are created outside of the body and screened for the genetic condition. Only those embryos which are not affected by the condition are placed back into the womb.",
      "Without medical intervention, Lucy says there would be four potential outcomes to any pregnancy she carried: A healthy and unaffected boy or girl, an affected boy she would likely miscarry or who would be born with severe brain damage or an affected girl.",
      "She pauses, then laughs: \"That sounds horrible, doesn't it? That's me.\"",
      "And that's the quandary. IVF will edit out the very thing that has made Lucy who she is today - a journalist, advocate, author and broadcaster.",
      "It is an emotive topic of debate. The most well-known conversation is around Down's syndrome and the number of women who choose to abort a pregnancy once their baby is tested and diagnosed as having the condition. The question is around the value people place on other peoples' lives which may not look like our own.",
      "In 2021 campaigner Heidi Crowter, who herself has Down's syndrome, challenged legislation allowing foetuses with the condition to be aborted up until birth. She took her case to the High Court arguing the rules were discriminatory to disabled people who could live a good life. She lost the case and the subsequent argument she made at the Court of Appeal. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) later rejected it as well, but Heidi continues to campaign to have the law overturned.",
      "It is something Lucy is very aware of and she and her husband have spent a long time considering.",
      "\"It's understanding that it is removing that part of me that makes me, me,\" Lucy says. \"It's such a personal decision and I know that I'm opening myself up for possible designer baby discussions, but I know I'm doing it for the right reasons.\"",
      "Lucy says first being diagnosed with IP and then losing her sight as a teenager were both traumatic events and she wants to minimise the likelihood of miscarriage to limit any future traumatic load.",
      "She says she found it impossible to \"knowingly\" consider having a baby naturally once she knew the science was available to give a baby the healthiest start possible.",
      "\"If I had a baby and, unknowingly, I had a gorgeous, gorgeous baby with disabilities, I would be so thankful, so happy and amazed but knowingly having this gene? That's why we're having IVF.\"",
      "IP doesn't just cause blindness, it can also cause severe epilepsy and more difficult outcomes. Lucy says having the option to ensure complications were not passed on felt like both a responsibility and a privilege previous generations did not have.",
      "\"Whether we like it or not, we have to be responsible here. Maybe a responsible issue for you, if you have IP or another genetic disorder, is to have a child naturally and we are not judging you in any shape or form, this is just our decision.\"",
      "In response to their openness around this decision comments were overwhelmingly positive from Lucy's fans which she thinks might be because she is so \"disability positive\" in her everyday life - \"I love being blind,\" she frequently states.",
      "But Lucy says responses have been different around the world. When she was working in Japan and her content was reaching audiences unfamiliar with her story, she faced a lot more trolling.",
      "\"I got a lot of abusive comments that go into my spam filter questioning why I would be a mother,\" she says. \"I know that I'm going to get a lot of abuse, but I'm just going to block them.",
      "\"I'm going to be OK. All I think about is the other mothers that have come before me who are competent, capable and resilient.\"",
      "Lucy, who is known for her How Does A Blind Girl... series of videos, is overjoyed by the prospect of IVF but she has also been frank about the fact she currently does not qualify, owing to her current weight, a sensitive element of IVF treatment that many keep to themselves.",
      "NHS guidelines specify your Body Mass Index (BMI) must be 30 or under to qualify - a healthy BMI is considered to be between 18.5 and 24.9.",
      "\"I need to be a BMI of 30 and I'm very open that I need to lose 9kg,\" Lucy says. \"I've already lost 15kg.\"",
      "Her health journey has involved swimming, lifting weights and many runs with Ollie tethered to her as her sighted guide. She has also found a love for batch cooking nutritious meals which she posts about on all of her channels on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube and the workarounds she has developed as a blind cook.",
      "\"I wanted a positive representation of losing weight online because it's all about this blinking jab,\" she says, referring to weight loss injections. \"I just wanted to lose it healthily, have lots of nice food, talk about meal prep and just smile and run.\"",
      "Once she hits the required BMI, Lucy will qualify for three rounds of IVF on the NHS.",
      "She will contact her consultant, after which she has to \"spit in a cup\" and offer up her DNA for genetic testing and analysis.",
      "Over a period of about three months, a genetics team will \"make a bespoke test to find the gene within my eggs,\" Lucy explains.",
      "Meanwhile Lucy will inject herself with trigger shots to stimulate the follicles within her ovaries to increase the number of eggs produced which will be retrieved, and then made into embryos with Ollie's sperm.",
      "The embryos will then be tested so only ones without the IP gene will be possible candidates. Those embryos will be \"shuffled about\" so Lucy and Ollie don't know which will be selected in terms of gender or other genetic qualities, and implanted into Lucy, who will carry the baby to term.",
      "Lucy can't wait for the moment she holds her baby in her arms.",
      "\"It will never stop being a thing within my mind that this gene is being eradicated,\" she admits. \"But I am very happy in my decision.\"",
      "A few days ago Lucy posted on Instagram, her cardigan tightened at the back with a hairband to make it smaller and fit.",
      "\"I've lost so much [weight] that my clothes are too loose now so we had to tie it up with a bobble,\" she tells her followers.",
      "\"Fingers crossed [we're] only a few weeks away from ringing the clinic.\"",

      "GPs will work more closely with specialists to access expert advice quickly for patients with conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, menopause symptoms and ear infections.",
      "Backed by \u00a380m of funding, its ambition is to help two million people receive faster and more convenient care in their local community by the end of 2025/26.",
      "Health Minister Karin Smyth said the scheme would \"save time and stop masses of people having to head to hospital for unnecessary appointments\".",
      "The expanded scheme is part of the government's plan to cut long NHS waiting lists and create extra appointments for patients.",
      "It has pledged that 92% of NHS patients will be waiting less than 18 weeks for treatment after referral to a consultant, by the end of this parliament.",
      "Between July and December 2024, the scheme diverted 660,000 treatments from hospitals and into the community, the government says.",
      "Called 'Advice and Guidance', the scheme links GPs and hospital specialists before patients are referred onto waiting lists, so that tests and treatments can be offered in the most convenient place.",
      "For example, patients with tinnitus and needing ear wax removal often end up being referred to specialists when they could be helped outside hospitals. And women needing advice on types of HRT could be treated in local hubs, rather than waiting to see a gynaecologist.",

      "\"The journey to bringing back the family doctor has only just begun. Now we must focus on the secretary of state's promise to complete negotiation of a new GP contract within the term of this Parliament in order to safeguard family GP services for the future, and we look forward to working closely with the government to achieve that.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 16 Apr 2025 06:23:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The number of people vaping in the UK has stalled, while disposable vape usage has fallen, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban on their sale on 1 June, a study suggests.",
      "The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, University College London (UCL) researchers say.",
      "But researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban \u2013 instead of giving up.",
      "As a result they warn the ban may only have a \"limited impact\" on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16 after several years of significant growth.",
      "The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments.",
      "The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm.",
      "GP Dr Helen Wall told BBC Breakfast that NHS advice is \"very clear\" that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking.",
      "\"But for people who have never smoked, and for young people particularly, to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental,\" she said.",
      "\"Our young people are becoming quite addicted. It's affecting their concentration, they're becoming agitated, their capacity to learn is affected, their developing brain can be affected.\"",
      "The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced.",
      "The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over.",
      "Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%.",
      "In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%.",
      "After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds.",
      "The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device.",
      "Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks \"more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices\" rather than stopping vaping altogether.",
      "\"We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,\" she adds.",
      "Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term.",
      "A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged.",
      "How are the vaping rules changing?",
      "Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with \"the most popular\" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models.",
      "\"They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,\" she says.",
      "While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face \"an issue of balance\".",
      "\"We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,\" she says.",
      "\"This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,\" she adds.",

      "The study confirmed the rate of Huntington's disease in northern Scotland is 14.5 per 100,000 people - more than five times the estimated worldwide rate of 2.71.",
      "The researchers from the University of Aberdeen found there are more than 160 adults living in Grampian, Highland, Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles who have the gene but have not been tested.",
      "Every child of someone affected has a 50:50 chance of inheriting the neurodegenerative gene which causes Huntington's.",
      "On average, every person who has been diagnosed with Huntington's disease will have at least another 2.2 relatives who have the gene, meaning there are hundreds of people in northern Scotland who could be considered for effective treatments in the future, researchers said.",
      "Previous studies have mainly looked at the number of people who tested positive for the gene then estimated the number of relatives at risk using statistical modelling.",
      "In the new study, published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, scientists used family tree clinical records to count how many people have a 50:50 chance of having inherited the condition but have not been tested.",

    "summary": "The landmark ruling could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "Judges at the UK Supreme Court have unanimously ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.",
      "It marks the culmination of a long-running legal battle which could have major implications for how sex-based rights apply across Scotland, England and Wales.",
      "The court sided with campaign group For Women Scotland, which brought a case against the Scottish government arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people that are born female.",
      "Judge Lord Hodge said the ruling should not be seen as a triumph of one side over the other, and stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",
      "Five key takeaways from Supreme Court ruling",
      "Women's campaigners celebrate court win - but what will it change?",
      "The Scottish government argued in court that transgender people with a gender recognition certificate (GRC) are entitled to the same sex-based protections as biological women.",
      "The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the proper interpretation of the 2010 Equality Act, which applies across Britain.",
      "Lord Hodge said the central question was how the words \"woman\" and \"sex\" are defined in the legislation.",
      "He told the court: \"The unanimous decision of this court is that the terms woman and sex in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.",
      "\"But we counsel against reading this judgement as a triumph of one or more groups in our society at the expense of another, it is not.\"",
      "He added that the legislation gives transgender people \"protection, not only against discrimination through the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, but also against direct discrimination, indirect discrimination and harassment in substance in their acquired gender\".",
      "Campaigners who brought the case against the Scottish government hugged each other and punched the air as they left the courtroom, with several of them in tears.",
      "The Equality Act provides protection against discrimination on the basis of various characteristics, including \"sex\" and \"gender reassignment\".",
      "Judges at the Supreme Court in London were asked to rule on what that law means by \"sex\" - whether it means biological sex, or legal, \"certificated\" sex as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.",
      "The Scottish government argued the 2004 legislation was clear that obtaining a GRC amounts to a change of sex \"for all purposes\".",
      "For Women Scotland argued for a \"common sense\" interpretation of the words man and woman, telling the court that sex is an \"immutable biological state\".",
      "Speaking outside the Supreme Court following the ruling, For Women Scotland co-founder Susan Smith said: \"Today the judges have said what we always believed to be the case, that women are protected by their biological sex.",
      "\"Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women and we are enormously grateful to the Supreme Court for this ruling.\"",
      "First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government accepted the judgement.",
      "He posted on social media: \"The ruling gives clarity between two relevant pieces of legislation passed at Westminster.",
      "\"We will now engage on the implications of the ruling.\"",
      "Swinney added: \"Protecting the rights of all will underpin our actions.\"",
      "A Scottish government spokesperson insisted ministers had acted \"in good faith\" during the legal proceedings, and noted that the Equality and Human Rights Commission was updating its guidance in response to the judgement.",
      "A UK government spokesman said the ruling would bring \"clarity and confidence for women and service providers such as hospitals, refuges, and sports clubs\".",
      "\"Single-sex spaces are protected in law and will always be protected by this government,\" the spokesman added.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch described the ruling as a \"victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious\".",
      "She added: \"It's important to be reminded the court strongly and clearly re-affirmed the Equality Act protects all trans people against discrimination, based on gender reassignment, and will continue to do so.\"",
      "'Deep concern'",
      "Harry Potter author JK Rowling posted on social media: \"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK.\"",
      "But Scottish Green MSP Maggie Chapman, a prominent campaigner for trans-rights, said: \"This is a deeply concerning ruling for human rights and a huge blow to some of the most marginalised people in our society.",
      "\"It could remove important protections and will leave many trans people and their loved ones deeply anxious and worried about how their lives will be affected and about what will come next.\"",
      "For Women Scotland had warned that if the court sided with the Scottish government, it would have implications for the running of single-sex spaces and services, such as hospital wards, prisons, refuges and support groups.",
      "Transgender people warned the case could erode the protections they have against discrimination in their reassigned gender.",
      "Scottish Trans manager Vic Valentine said the organisation was \"shocked\" by the court ruling, arguing that it \"reverses 20 years of understanding on how the law recognises trans men and women with gender recognition certificates\".",
      "They added: \"This judgement seems to suggest that there will be times where trans people can be excluded from both men's and women's spaces and services.",
      "\"It is hard to understand where we would then be expected to go - or how this decision is compatible with a society that is fair and equal for everybody.\"",
      "The case follows years of heated debate over transgender and women's rights, including controversy over transgender rapist Isla Bryson initially being put in a women's prison and an ongoing employment tribunal involving a female NHS Fife nurse who objected to a transgender doctor using a women's changing room.",
      "NHS Fife said it would \"carefully consider\" the court's judgement.",
      "'Biological' or 'certified'?",
      "The judges ruled that interpreting sex as \"certificated\" rather than \"biological\" would \"cut across the definitions of man and \"woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way\".",
      "They said a \"certified\" definition of sex would weaken protections for lesbians, citing the example of lesbian-only spaces and associations as it would mean that a trans woman who was attracted to women would be classed as a lesbian.",
      "The ruling found the biological interpretation of sex was also required for single-sex spaces to \"function coherently\".",
      "It cited changing rooms, hostels, medical services and single-sex higher education institutions.",
      "The judges noted \"similar confusion and impracticability\" had arisen in relation to single-sex associations and charities, women's sport, public sector equality and the armed forces.",
      "The judges added: \"The practical problems that arise under a certificated sex approach are clear indicators that this interpretation is not correct.\"",
      "Gender reassignment is a protected characteristic in law, making it is illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis that they are transgender.",
      "However, single-sex spaces can exclude people with GRCs \"if it is proportionate to do so\".",
      "Dr Nick McKerrell, senior law lecturer at Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ruling means a transgender women with a GRC who was excluded from a single-sex space would be unable to argue she is being discriminated against as a woman.",
      "He also said the ruling implied that workplaces would need to provide separate spaces for people on the basis of biological sex.",
      "But the law lecturer said arguments over access to single-sex spaces would not be \"settled\" by this court case.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It doesn't mean everything overnight is going to change in terms of stopping trans people from accessing services. It will depend on what providers think the new definition will mean for them.\"",
      "Dr McKerrell said the judgement does not immediately change anything for the rules on transgender participation in women's sport, but that it might prompt a \"reassessment\" of rules.",
      "How did we get here?",
      "The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards.",
      "For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law.",
      "The issue has been contested several times in the Scottish courts.",
      "Holyrood ministers won the most recent case in Scotland, with judge Lady Haldane ruling in 2022 that the definition of sex was \"not limited to biological or birth sex\".",
      "The Scottish Parliament passed reforms that year that would have made it easier for someone to change their legally recognised sex.",
      "The move was blocked by the UK government, and has since been dropped by Holyrood ministers.",

      "The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre.",
      "The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply.",
      "The fall in inflation means that, although prices continue to rise, the pace is slowing. Price rises have slowed from highs seen in recent years.",
      "Wages continue to outpace inflation with salary raises for public sector workers growing more than those in the private sector.",
      "The average rise in wages was 5.9%, data released by the ONS on Tuesday showed.",

      "How quickly are prices rising?",
      "In May, the inflation figure for April will likely be pushed to around 3% due to increases in gas prices, electricity prices, and water charges, said Michael Saunders, senior advisor at Oxford Economics.",

      "Reading out the ruling, Lord Hodge cautioned that it should not be taken as a triumph for one group in society over another.",
      "But there were scenes of jubilation for women's campaigners outside the Supreme Court.",
      "Tearful hugs were exchanged and a bottle of champagne was cracked open.",
      "The fact someone had thought to bring one along underlines that it was potentially on the cards, but For Women Scotland (FWS) still seemed shocked by the scale of their victory.",
      "The Scottish government's argument - that sex can be changed via the gender recognition process, and that someone with a gender recognition certificate should have the protections of that sex - were dismissed.",
      "So what does it all mean?",
      "Supreme Court backs 'biological' definition of woman",
      "UK Supreme Court rules legal definition of a woman is based on biological sex",
      "The application of the law on the ground, in \"real life\", was clearly foremost in the minds of the judges.",
      "Take the example of single sex spaces and services - part of the motivation for FWS bringing this case.",
      "The previous reading of the law was that everything from hospital wards and prison wings to support groups for victims of abuse can exclude everyone but women thanks to exceptions in the Equality Act.",
      "The concern from campaigners was that if people could change their sex with a certificate, and then claim protection against discrimination as a woman, that could be more complicated.",
      "That's particularly the case on a practical level, given those providing these services aren't actually meant to ask to see a gender recognition certificate.",
      "Now, the court is clear that this exemption can continue - the rules underpinning women-only spaces can exclude people with gender recognition certificates, along with everyone else.",
      "Does the Equality Act still protect trans people?",
      "There are still conditions which need to be satisfied - services will have to show that excluding trans people is a limited and proportionate means to achieving a legitimate aim.",
      "Blanket bans are generally discouraged. There is still a bar to clear to exclude anyone, and the test of proportionality has to be met in each case.",
      "The Equality and Human Rights Commission - which oversees the application of the Equality Act - is to issue new guidance to help service providers",
      "But FWS are clearly delighted with the underlying principle, and hope it will lead to clearer guidance for those providing services.",
      "It's important to note that trans people are still protected by the Equality Act.",
      "The protected characteristic of gender reassignment is not affected by this ruling, and Lord Hodge stressed that there are other defences against direct and indirect discrimination and harassment.",
      "He was clear that trans people are a \"vulnerable and often harassed minority\", who \"struggle against discrimination and prejudice as they seek to live their lives with dignity\".",
      "But the court has held that it would be problematic to effectively divide trans people between two different protected characteristics, depending on whether they have a certificate.",
      "Again, judges stressed that this is particularly the case when service providers can't ask to see the certificate.",
      "They say the law needs to be \"clear and consistent\" - and that including those with a GRC in with women would ultimately be \"incoherent\".",
      "The court carefully weighs the letter of the law, but it's worth remembering that ultimately that law is drafted by politicians - and it can be changed at the stroke of a pen.",
      "Will gender reform be relaunched at Holyrood?",
      "The issue may now move out of the legal arena and back into the political one.",
      "There had been some pressure on the UK government to clarify the definitions of the Equality Act, which is Westminster legislation.",
      "The court has handily done that for them, and UK ministers have welcomed the ruling.",
      "There may be more political pressure on the Scottish government, given it has lost this case.",
      "For a long time, ministers have batted away questions about this case - such as, do they really believe in the legal points their lawyers are making? - by saying they can't comment on live litigation.",
      "They will have to go into a little more detail now, but I imagine this is issue still just about the last thing they want to talk about.",
      "There had been some speculation that a ruling like this could raise the prospect of ministers re-launching their attempts at gender reform at Holyrood.",
      "But frankly there is not the political will in the John Swinney administration to ride into battle on this issue, as there was under his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "With a Holyrood election looming, there is no prospect of the first minister deciding to wade back into such a contentious debate.",
      "But with For Women Scotland now hoping to use this ruling to hold his feet to fire when it comes to broader government policies and guidance, it is one he will need to address."

    "story": [
      "US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK, suggesting it would be easier to land than with other European countries due to \"a much more reciprocal relationship\".",
      "UK business and trade minister Sarah Jones welcomed Vance's comments and said talks to secure a deal with the US were ongoing, but declined to provide a timeline on their progress.",
      "\"Nobody wants tariffs. No one wants a tariff war. We want to secure a deal with the US,\" she added.",
      "The real question about positive comments by Vice-President JD Vance and Jones about a UK-US trade deal, is what they actually mean by the term \"deal\".",
      "Just after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to the White House in February, it was rather telling that the UK delegation referred to what was being negotiated as an \"economic deal\".",
      "This was meant to show that this \"deal\" was not about an extensive free trade agreement, covering nearly all goods.",
      "In Trump's first term, negotiations between the UK and US progressed fairly well up until the point controversial issues about medicine pricing and food standards emerged.",
      "Trump's team told me back then that they were waiting to see how close the UK would remain to European Union rules after Brexit.",
      "This time around, the \"deal\" seems to have been about science, technology and artificial intelligence cooperation in return for avoiding tariffs.",
      "The US has wanted to talk about the UK's \"tech tax\" on mainly US digital companies, and has raised issues about the Online Safety Act.",
      "However, there is a big problem now.",
      "The US has now levied a 10% tax on UK imports as part of what it called its \"reciprocal tariffs\".",
      "But there is no general problem with this trading relationship. In fact, the UK buys more from the US than the other way around.",
      "The mood music from Washington is that this 10% tariff is not for negotiation with anyone. That is the baseline tariff that has been levied on nearly all of America's trading partners.",
      "Making an exception for one country would simply invite significant trade diversion.",
      "'Good chance' of US-UK trade deal, says Vance",
      "But the UK is in a different position than other nations.",
      "Most countries had faced higher tariffs - as illustrated on Donald Trump's big board - such as on electronics manufacturers in East Asia and they want to keep the levy at the 10% rate.",
      "The net result is that the UK may not have much to negotiate here, and yet is being treated very harshly, given there is no US trade deficit.",
      "Factor in the exemptions for electronics which benefit the likes of China and the fact that cars, a major industry for Britain, are being tariffed at 25% and the UK side has much to complain about.",
      "Another issue is that all this is being done at the same time as the post-Brexit reset negotiations are being outlined ahead of the UK-EU summit next month.",
      "The word is that the UK and EU would like to secure an ambitious deal which aligns closely on export rules. The aim of this reset would be to rid food and farm exports of most red tape.",
      "The US has taken an interest in this in the past. Could the US make it part of their negotiation?",
      "In addition, many US officials have mentioned a desire for allies to join it in containing China.",
      "The US might also try to force a choice on the UK here, or at least encourage action to keep out diverted Chinese goods.",
      "All this would fly in the face of the UK government's entire sell to the world that Britain could be the \"most connected economy in the world\" with strong links into European goods markets, US technology and the east Asia market, including China.",
      "There is a final factor here, which is very intriguing.",
      "Given last week's chaos in financial markets including for US government debt, it is now the case that the US needs these deals, especially the easy pickings with its closest allies.",
      "The UK has more leverage than it did a month ago. The PM may not want to use it but the US cannot afford to make the UK stall or walk away."

      "It is the last plant in the UK producing virgin steel, which is used in major construction projects like buildings and railways. It has fewer imperfections than the recycled steel made elsewhere in the country.",

      "However, following financial collapse in 2019, British Steel was taken over by the government's insolvency service.",
      "It was sold to Chinese steel-making firm Jingye the following year.",
      "Can British Steel's blast furnaces keep running?",
      "Scunthorpe's skyline has four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria. Bess and Anne are the only two still working.",
      "The supplies needed to keep them running - coking coal and iron pellets - are running low.",
      "But a delivery of the materials will be unloaded at Immingham docks and transported to Scunthorpe on Tuesday. A separate shipment of materials on its way to the UK from Australia.",
      "On Saturday, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it had become clear that Jingye intended to \"refuse\" to buy enough material to keep the furnaces running, and \"to cancel and refuse to pay for existing orders\".",
      "\"The company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally closed down primary steel making at British Steel,\" he added.",
      "Why can't a blast furnace easily be restarted?",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "The furnaces operate at extreme temperatures, with iron ore and coking coal poured in at the top and liquid iron extracted at the bottom. This iron goes to the steel plant to make steel.",
      "If a furnace stops working, the molten metal will cool and solidify. This is called a \"salamander\".",
      "When the furnace is turned back on this metal heats up again and expands which can crack the furnace.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" process can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal. However, this can be a dangerous process.",
      "Has British Steel been nationalised?",
      "The emergency legislation fast-tracked through Parliament on Saturday gives the government the ability to order raw materials for the furnaces and to direct the company's workforce and managers.",
      "Any employees sacked by the Chinese owners can be reinstated and the plant can be entered by force, if necessary, to secure assets.",
      "But Jingye will retain ownership of it for now.",
      "This means British Steel has not been nationalised - which is when a government takes ownership and control of a company.",
      "However, the business secretary acknowledged that public ownership was \"the likely option\" as there are currently no companies willing to buy the plant.",
      "If British Steel is nationalised, taxpayers' money will be used to run it. Reynolds says it is currently making an annual net loss of \u00a3233m, but had the furnaces been allowed to shut the cost to the taxpayer would be higher.",
      "Industry Minister Sarah Jones told the BBC the costs would come from an existing \u00a32.5bn fund for steel.",
      "\"We are hoping as you know to bring in a private sector partner as part of the future of Scunthorpe but those conversations are ongoing,\" she added.",
      "Why is the Scunthorpe plant losing money?",
      "In late March 2025, Jingye said the plant was losing around \u00a3700,000 a day and launched a consultation on its closure.",
      "It said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable,\" blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with moving to lower-carbon production techniques.",
      "UK steel production has been falling for several decades and the financial pressures facing the industry were heightened in March when the US imposed a 25% tariff on any steel it imports.",
      "Global over-production has created \"a glut of steel on the international market\", according to a UK government UK government briefing, which has pushed prices down. British manufacturers also face higher costs, particularly on electricity, than elsewhere.",

    "summary": "A pilot project will test whether it is a useful way of fighting climate change.",
    "story": [
      "A ground-breaking project to suck carbon out of the sea has started operating on England's south coast.",
      "The small pilot scheme, known as SeaCURE, is funded by the UK government as part of its search for technologies that fight climate change.",
      "There's broad consensus among climate scientists that the overwhelming priority is to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the chief cause of global warming.",
      "But many scientists also believe that part of the solution will have to involve capturing some of the gases that have already been released.",
      "These projects, known as carbon capture, usually focus either on capturing emissions at source or pulling them from the air.",
      "What makes SeaCure interesting is that it is testing whether it might be more efficient to pull planet-warming carbon from the sea, since it is present in greater concentrations in water than in the air.",
      "To reach the project's entrance you have to go round the back of the Weymouth Sealife Centre and walk past a sign that says \"Caution: Moray Eels may Bite\".",
      "There's a reason this ground-breaking project has been placed here.",
      "It's a pipe that snakes under the stony beach and out into the English Channel, sucking up seawater and bringing it onshore.",
      "The project is trying to find whether removing carbon from the water might be a cost effective way of reducing the amount of the climate warming gas CO2 in the atmosphere.",
      "SeaCURE processes the seawater to remove the carbon before pumping it back out to sea where it absorbs more CO2.",
      "We're the first broadcast journalists to visit and Professor Tom Bell from Plymouth Marine Laboratory is tasked with showing us around.",
      "He explains that the process begins by treating some of the seawater to make it more acidic. This encourages the carbon that's dissolved in the seawater to turn into a gas and be released into the atmosphere as CO2.",
      "\"This is the seawater stripper\" Prof Bell says with a smile as we turn a corner.",
      "The \"stripper\" is a large stainless steel tank which maximises the amount of contact between the acidic seawater and the air.",
      "\"When you open a fizzy drink it froths, that's the CO2 coming out.\" Prof Bell says. \"What we're doing by spreading the seawater on a large surface area. It's a bit like pouring a drink on the floor and allowing the CO2 to come out of the seawater really quickly.\"",
      "The CO2 that emerges into the air is sucked away and then concentrated using charred coconut husks ready to be stored.",
      "The low-carbon seawater then has alkali added to it \u2013 to neutralise the acid that was added \u2013 and is then pumped back out into a stream that flows into the sea.",
      "Once back in the sea it immediately starts to absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere contributing in a very small way to reducing greenhouse gases.",
      "There are already much more developed carbon capture technologies which take carbon directly out of the air \u2013 but Dr Paul Halloran who leads the SeaCURE project tells me that using water instead has its advantages.",
      "\"Seawater has got loads of carbon in it compared to the air, about 150 times more,\" says Dr Halloran.",
      "\"But it has got different challenges, the energy requirements to generate the products that we require to do this from seawater are huge.\"",
      "At present the amount of CO2 this pilot project is removing is tiny \u2013 at most 100 metric tonnes per year \u2013 that's less CO2 than a commercial plane emits crossing the Atlantic. But given the size of the world's oceans those behind SeaCURE think it has potential.",
      "In its submission to the UK government SeaCURE said the technology had the potential to be massively scaled up to remove 14 billion tonnes of CO2 a year if 1% of the world's seawater on the ocean's surface was processed.",
      "For that to be plausible the entire process for stripping the carbon \u2013 would have to be powered by renewable energy. Possibly by solar panels in a floating installation at sea.",
      "\"Carbon removal is necessary. If you want to reach net zero emissions and net zero emissions is needed to halt further warming,\" says Dr Oliver Geden who's part of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and an expert in carbon capture.",
      "\"Capturing directly from seawater is one of the options. Directly capturing it from the air is another one. There are basically 15 to 20 options, and in the end the question of what to use, of course, will depend on the cost.\"",
      "The Seacure project has \u00a33m of funding from the government and is one of 15 pilot projects being backed in the UK as part of efforts to develop technologies that capture and store greenhouse gases.",
      "\"Removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere is essential in helping us achieve net zero,\" says energy minister Kerry McCarthy. \"Innovative projects like SeaCURE at the University of Exeter play an important role in creating the green technologies needed to make this happen, while supporting skilled jobs and boosting growth.\"",
      "'Some impact on environment'",
      "There's also the question of what a large quantity of low-carbon water would do to the sea and the things that live in it. In Weymouth it dribbles out of a pipe in such small quantities it is unlikely to have any impact.",
      "Guy Hooper is a PhD student at Exeter University and is researching the possible impacts of the project. He's been exposing marine creatures to low-carbon water under laboratory conditions.",
      "\"Marine organisms rely on carbon to do certain things,\" he says. \"So phytoplankton use carbon to photosynthesize while things like mussels also use carbon to build their shells.\"",
      "Hooper says early indications are that massively increasing the amount of low-carbon water could have some impact on the environment.",
      "\"It might be damaging but there might be ways to mitigate that \u2013 for example through pre-diluting the low-carbon water. It's important this is included in the discussion early on.\"",

      "Scientists have found new but tentative evidence that a faraway world orbiting another star may be home to life.",
      "A Cambridge team studying the atmosphere of a planet called K2-18b has detected signs of molecules which on Earth are only produced by simple organisms.",
      "This is the second, and more promising, time chemicals associated with life have been detected in the planet's atmosphere by Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).",
      "But the team and independent astronomers stress that more data is needed to confirm these results.",
      "The lead researcher, Prof Nikku Madhusudhan, told me at his lab at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy that he hopes to obtain the clinching evidence soon.",
      "\"This is the strongest evidence yet there is possibly life out there. I can realistically say that we can confirm this signal within one to two years.\"",
      "K2-18b is two-and-a-half times the size of Earth and is 700 trillion miles, or 124 light years, away from us - a distance far beyond what any human could travel in a lifetime.",
      "JWST is so powerful that it can analyse the chemical composition of the planet's atmosphere from the light that passes through from the small red Sun it orbits.",
      "The Cambridge group has found that the atmosphere seems to contain the chemical signature of at least one of two molecules that are associated with life: dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). On Earth, these gases are produced by marine phytoplankton and bacteria.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan said he was surprised by how much gas was apparently detected during a single observation window.",
      "\"The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,\" he said.",
      "\"So, if the association with life is real, then this planet will be teeming with life,\" he added.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan went further: \"If we confirm that there is life on K2-18b, it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy.\"",
      "He told BBC Radio 5Live on Thursday: \"This is a very important moment in science, but also very important to us as a species.",
      "\"If there is one example, and the universe being infinite, there is a chance for life on many more planets.\"",
      "Dr Subir Sarkar, a lecturer in astrophysics at Cardiff University and part of the research team, said the research suggests K2-18b could have an ocean which could be potentially full of life - though he cautioned scientists \"don't know for sure\".",
      "He added that the research team's work will continue to focus on looking for life on other planets: \"Keep watching this space.\"",
      "The truth about life on other planets - and what it means for humans",
      "There are lots of \"ifs\" and \"buts\" at this stage, as Prof Madhusudhan's team freely admits.",
      "Firstly, this latest detection is not at the standard required to claim a discovery.",
      "For that, the researchers need to be about 99.99999% sure that their results are correct and not a fluke reading. In scientific jargon, that is a five sigma result.",
      "These latest results are only three sigma, or 99.7%. Which sounds like a lot, but it is not enough to convince the scientific community. However, it is much more than the one sigma result of 68% the team obtained 18 months ago, which was greeted with much scepticism at the time.",
      "But even if the Cambridge team obtains a five sigma result, that won't be conclusive proof that life exists on the planet, according to Prof Catherine Heymans of Edinburgh University and Scotland's Astronomer Royal, who is independent of the research team.",
      "\"Even with that certainty, there is still the question of what is the origin of this gas,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"On Earth it is produced by microorganisms in the ocean, but even with perfect data we can't say for sure that this is of a biological origin on an alien world because loads of strange things happen in the Universe and we don't know what other geological activity could be happening on this planet that might produce the molecules.\"",
      "That view is one the Cambridge team agree with. They are working with other groups to see if DMS and DMDS can be produced by non-living means in the lab.",
      "\"There is still a 0.3% chance that it might be a statistical fluke,\" Prof Madhusudhan said.",
      "Suggesting life may exist on another planet was \"a big claim if true\", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding: \"So we want to be really, really thorough, and make more observations, and get the evidence to the level that there is less than a one-in-a-million chance of it being a fluke.\"",
      "He said this should be possible in \"maybe one or two years\".",
      "Other research groups have put forward alternative, lifeless, explanations for the data obtained from K2-18b. There is a strong scientific debate not only about whether DMS and DMDS are present but also the planet's composition.",
      "The reason many researchers infer that the planet has a vast liquid ocean is the absence of the gas ammonia in K2-18b's atmosphere. Their theory is that the ammonia is absorbed by a vast body of water below.",
      "But it could equally be explained by an ocean of molten rock, which would preclude life, according to Prof Oliver Shorttle of Cambridge University.",
      "\"Everything we know about planets orbiting other stars comes from the tiny amounts of light that glance off their atmospheres. So it is an incredibly tenuous signal that we are having to read, not only for signs of life, but everything else,\" he said.",
      "\"With K2-18b part of the scientific debate is still about the structure of the planet.\"",
      "Dr Nicolas Wogan at Nasa's Ames Research Center has yet another interpretation of the data. He published research suggesting that K2-18b is a mini gas giant with no surface.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:11:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

      "Flights were grounded for eight days in mid-April 2010 with a major impact on passengers in the UK and around the world",
      "'Black Swan Event'",
      "The day after the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption which spewed ash high into the atmosphere - around 20 to 50,000ft (4-10 miles) where commercial airlines operate - that ash started to drift southward into UK airspace.",
      "International aviation rules at the time were that aircraft could not fly into any levels of volcanic ash and the airspace was quickly closed down.",
      "This had never caused a problem before because most volcanic eruptions up to that point were localised and airlines were able to fly around ash cloud without issue.",
      "According to Jonathan Nicholson from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA): \"It was what a lot of people called a 'Black Swan Event' - unforeseen, typically with extreme consequences - but it was a Black Swan that was ultimately predictable because Icelandic volcanoes happened and will continue to happen.\"",

      "\"An eye opener globally\"",
      "The Met Office operates one of nine global Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres (VAAC) and is responsible for issuing advisories for volcanic eruptions originating from the north eastern corner of the North Atlantic, including Iceland.",
      "Once Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull erupted the centre ran computer models with forecast data and for Dr Matthew Hort, Head of Atmospheric Dispersion at the Met Office, it was the most intense period of his working life before and since.",
      "He said: \"It was an eye opener globally. The unique thing about the Icelandic eruption was that it happened in an area where we had winds from the north that brought the ash down across UK airspace and trans-Atlantic routes.\"",
      "Four days after the main eruption the Met Office dispersion forecasts showed ash across the UK, the Atlantic, most of Europe and western Russia.",
      "As the days of disruption went on with no sign of ash contamination clearing, everyone was under pressure to find a way to re-open airspace in a safe and controlled way.",
      "Airlines and engine manufacturers had to conduct research to ascertain if there was a safe level of ash concentration which wouldn't damage jet engines.",
      "Rolls-Royce was at the forefront of pioneering testing and for the first time was able to establish a level of volcanic ash that didn't seriously affect the jet engine over a given timeframe.",
      "Mr Nicholson explained: \"In conjunction with Met Office forecasts it enabled us to open airspace where there were low levels of ash.\"",
      "On 20 April after an international teleconference headed by the CAA, it was agreed that 2 milligrams of ash per cubic metre of air was an acceptable safe ash concentration.",
      "Airspace re-opened that night with flights operating as normal.",
      "Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull continued to erupt well into June with occasional spikes of higher ash concentration coming into the UK but under the new rules authorities were able to keep most of the airspace open with only localised airport closures.",
      "Airlines had a 'zero volcanic ash' policy for jet engines in 2010",
      "Have things changed?",
      "In the months and years after research and working groups continued to assess procedures and rules.",
      "\"The work that happened very quickly at the time around the event got us to 90% of where we are now\u2026but that has been consolidated and put into specific safety measures,\" Mr Nicholson said.",
      "Today there are three levels of volcanic ash contamination - low, medium and high, with guidance on how long a pilot can fly in those concentrations before causing significant damage.",
      "\"If something similar happened today, it will be up to the airlines to use their own permissions from the engine manufacturers and their own safety cases to decide where and when, based on forecasts, will allow them to go,\" Mr Nicholson added.",
      "\"And that will be different for each airline as some may accept higher or lower levels of ash as acceptable.\"",
      "There has also been a massive development programme in the monitoring and forecasting of volcanic ash.",
      "As a direct result of the ash cloud the Met Office deployed permanent LIDAR instruments that point a laser into the sky capable of measuring ash concentrations.",
      "New satellites have also been launched globally which enable scientists to monitor ash concentrations every 15 minutes.",
      "In addition there have been advances in computer modelling to improve the physics and processes involved in how different shapes and sizes of volcanic ash behave in the atmosphere.",
      "Volcano has been erupting intermittendly near Grindavik, Icleand with large lava flows but no ash cloud",
      "Could it happen again?",
      "What is clear today is that as a direct result of 2010, with all the improvements made, the UK and Europe is in a much better place to control and manage volcanic ash.",
      "In recent months there have been small eruptions in Iceland leading to the evacuation of Grindavik and the closure of the famous Blue Lagoon spa.",
      "However, there has been little concern to aviation as these recent eruptions are mostly small fissure eruptions with large and slow lava flows - rather than the explosive ash eruption from Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull.",
      "Experts believe that if the 2010 volcanic ash event happened today there would be \"nowhere near the same level, if any, disruption\" according to both Dr Hort and Mr Nicholson, largely because we now know that the level of ash seen in UK airspace in 2010 was relatively low and safe to fly in.",
      "But Dr Hort warns: \"You can always have a bigger eruption.\"",

    "summary": "Could discoveries of alien life ever change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "There are some scientific discoveries that do much more than advance our knowledge: they create a shift in our psyche as they show us the scale of the Universe and our place in it.",
      "One such moment was when space craft sent back images of the Earth for the first time. Another is the discovery of life on another world, a moment that has inched a little closer today with the news that signs of a gas, which on Earth is produced by simple marine organisms, has been found on a planet called K2-18b.",
      "Now, the prospect of really finding alien life - meaning we are not alone in the Universe - is not far away, according to the scientist leading the team that made the detection.",
      "\"This is basically as big as it gets in terms of fundamental questions, and we may be on the verge of answering that question,\" says Prof Nikku Madhusudhan of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge University.",
      "But all of this prompts even more questions, including, if they do find life on another world, how will this change us as a species?",
      "Flying saucers and sci-fi aliens",
      "Our ancestors have long created stories of beings that might dwell in the skies. In the early 20th Century, astronomers thought they could see straight line features on the Martian surface, raising speculation that one of our nearest planets might be home to an advanced civilisation: an idea that spawned a wealth of pulp science fiction culture involving flying saucers and little green aliens.",
      "It was during an era when western governments generated fear of the spread of communism, so visitors from outer space were more often than not portrayed as menaces, bringing peril rather than hope.",
      "But decades on, what has been described as \"the strongest evidence yet\" of life on another world has come, not from Mars or Venus, but from a planet hundreds of trillions of miles away orbiting a distant star.",
      "Part of the challenge when it comes to researching the existence of alien life  is knowing where to look.",
      "Until relatively recently, the focus for Nasa's search for life was Mars, but that began to change in 1992 with the discovery of the first planet orbiting another star outside of our solar system.",
      "Although astronomers had suspected that there were other worlds around distant stars there had been no proof until that point. Since then, nearly 6,000 planets outside our solar system have been discovered.",
      "Scientists find 'strongest evidence yet' of life on distant planet",
      "Many are so-called gas giants, like Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system. Others are either too hot or too cold to support liquid water, thought to be essential for life.",
      "But many are in what astronomers call \"The Goldilocks Zone\" where the distance is \"just right\" to support life. Prof Madhusudhan believes there could be thousands in our galaxy.",
      "Breathtakingly ambitious tech",
      "As these so-called exoplanets were being discovered, scientists began to develop instruments to analyse the chemical composition of their atmospheres. Their ambition was breathtaking, some would say audacious.",
      "The idea was to capture the tiny amount of starlight glancing through the atmospheres of these faraway worlds and study them for chemical fingerprints of molecules, which on Earth can only be produced by living organisms, so-called biosignatures.",
      "And they succeeded in developing such instruments for ground and space-based telescopes.",
      "Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which detected the gas on the planet called K2-18b in this week's discovery, is the most powerful space telescope ever built and its launch in 2021 generated excitement that the search for life was at long last within humanity's grasp.",
      "But JWST has its limits - it can't detect faraway planets as small as ours or as close to their parent stars, because of the glare. So, Nasa is planning the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), scheduled for the 2030s, which will be able to spot and sample the atmospheres of planets similar to our own. (This is possible using what is effectively a high-tech sunshield that minimises light from the star which a planet orbits.)",
      "Also coming online later this decade is the European Southern Observatory (ESO)'s Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), which will be on the ground, looking up at the crystal-clear skies of the Chilean desert.",
      "It has the largest mirror of any instrument built, 39-metres in diameter, and so can see vastly more detail at planetary atmospheres than its predecessors.",
      "More discoveries, more questions",
      "Prof Madhusudan, however, hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. But even if he does achieve his aim, this won't lead to mass celebrations about the discovery of life on another world.",
      "Instead, it will be the start of another robust scientific debate about whether the biosignature could be produced by non-living means.",
      "Eventually though, as more data is gathered from more atmospheres and as chemists fail in finding alternative explanations for biosignatures, the scientific consensus will slowly and gradually shift towards the probability that life does exist on other worlds, according to Prof Catherine Heymans, from Edinburgh University, who is Scotland's Astronomer Royal.",
      "\"With more time on telescopes, astronomers will get a clearer vision of the chemical compositions of these atmospheres. You won't know that it's definitely life. But I think the more data that's built up, and that if you see this in multiple different systems, not just this one particular planet, it gives us more confidence\".",
      "The world wide web emerged in a series of incremental technological breakthroughs that didn't necessarily feel of enormous consequence at the time.",
      "In similar fashion, it may dawn on people that possibly the most enormous scientific, cultural and social transformation in the whole of human history has happened, but that the moment the balance was tipped in terms of there being other life out there was not fully recognised at the time.",
      "A much more definitive discovery would be to discover life in our own solar system using robotic space craft containing portable laboratories. Any off-world bug could be analysed, possibly even brought back to Earth, providing prima facie evidence to at least significantly limit any scientific push back that may ensue.",
      "The scientific case for the possibility of life or past life in our own solar system has increased in recent years following data sent back by various spacecraft, so several missions to search for signs of it are on their way.",
      "The European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover, planned for launch in 2028, will drill below the surface of Mars to search for signs of past and possibly present life. Given the extreme conditions on Mars, however, the discovery of fossilised past life is the more likely outcome.",
      "China's Tianwen-3 mission, also planned for launch in 2028 is designed to collect samples and bring them back to Earth by 2031. Nasa and ESA each have spacecraft on their way to the icy moons of Jupiter to see if there may be water, possibly vast oceans, under their icy surfaces.",
      "But the spacecraft are not designed to find life itself.  Instead, these missions lay the ground for future missions which will, according to Prof Michele Dougherty of Imperial College, London.",
      "\"It is a long, slow process,\" she says. \"The next decision to make would be a lander, which moon it goes to, and where we should be landing.",
      "\"You don't want to land where the ice crust is so thick that there is no way you can get underneath the surface. And so, it's a long, slow burn, but it's pretty exciting en route\".",
      "Nasa is also sending a spacecraft called Dragonfly to land on one of the moons of Saturn, Titan in 2034. It is an exotic world with what are thought to be lakes and clouds made from carbon-rich chemicals which give the planet an eerie orange haze, bringing The Beatles\u2018 song, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds to mind: a world with \"marmalade skies\".",
      "Along with water these chemicals are thought to be a necessary ingredient for life.",
      "Prof Dougherty is one of the leading planetary scientists in her field. Does she think there is life on one of the icy Moons of Jupiter or Saturn?",
      "\"I'd be very surprised if there wasn't,\" she says, beaming with delight.",
      "\"Three things are required: a heat source, liquid water and organic (carbon-based) chemicals. If we have those three ingredients, the chances that life is able to form rises really steeply.",
      "Reducing human 'specialness'",
      "If simple life forms are found to exist that is no guarantee that more complex life forms are out there.",
      "Prof Madhusudhan believes that, if confirmed, simple life should be \"pretty common\" in the galaxy. \"But going from that simple life to complex life is a big step, and that is an open question. How that step happens? What are the conditions that govern that? We don't know that. And then going from there to intelligent life is another big step.\"",
      "Dr Robert Massey, who is the deputy executive director of the Royal Astronomical Society, agrees that the emergence of intelligent life on another world is much less likely than simple life.",
      "\"When we see the emergence of life on Earth, it was so complex. It took such a long time for multi-cellular life to emerge and then evolve into diverse life forms.",
      "\"The big question is whether there was something about the Earth that made that evolution possible. Do we need exactly the same conditions, our size, our oceans and land masses for that to happen on other worlds or will that happen regardless?\"",
      "He believes that the discovery of even simple alien life would be the latest chapter in the diminution of humanity's place in the cosmos.",
      "As he puts it, centuries ago, we believed we were at the centre of the Universe and with each discovery in astronomy we have found ourselves \"more displaced\" from that point. \"I think the discovery of life elsewhere it would further reduce our specialness,\" he says.",
      "Prof Dougherty, on the other hand, believes that such a discovery in our own solar system would be good for science, and good for the soul.",
      "\"The discovery of even simple life will allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved way back those millions of aeons ago when we first evolved. And so, for me, it's helping us find our place in the Universe.",
      "\"If we know there is life, elsewhere in our solar system and potentially beyond, [this] would somehow be comforting to me, knowing that we're a fabric of something larger will make us bigger\".",
      "Never before have scientists searched so hard for life on other worlds and never before have they had such incredible tools to do this with. And many working in the field believe that it is a matter of when, rather than if, they discover life on other worlds. And rather than bringing fear, the discovery of alien life will bring hope, according to Prof Madhusudhan.",
      "\"When we would look at the sky, we would see not just physical objects, stars and planets, we would see a living sky. The societal ramifications of that are immense. It will be a huge transformational change in the way we look at ourselves in the cosmic scene.",
      "\"It will fundamentally change the human psyche in how we view ourselves and each other, and any barriers, linguistic, political, geographical, will dissolve, as we realise we are all one. And that will bring us closer,\" he continues.",

    "summary": "China sits at the heart of Apple's supply chain - and has benefited hugely from it. Can they break up?",
    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

    "summary": "Led by Jensen Huang, dubbed the 'Taylor Swift of tech', the chip giant has become pivotal in the race for AI supremacy.",
    "story": [
      "Computer chip giant Nvidia has once again found itself at the centre of US-China tensions over trade and technology.",
      "On Thursday Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang flew to Beijing to meet senior Chinese officials, just after the US imposed new export controls on its chips.",
      "The California-based company will require licenses to export its H20 AI chip to China, a move which the US Commerce Department said was designed to safeguard \"national and economic security\". Nvidia said federal officials had told them the requirement will be in force for the \"indefinite future\".",
      "But why is the company so pivotal in the race for AI supremacy between the US and China?",
      "What is Nvidia?",
      "Nvidia designs advanced chips, or semiconductors, that are used in generative artificial intelligence. Generative AI can produce new content from a user's prompt, like ChatGPT.",
      "In recent years, a surge in global demand for AI chips led Nvidia to become one of the world's most valuable companies. In November, Nvidia briefly unseated Apple as the largest company in the world by market capitalisation.",
      "Because its chips are seen as so essential to advancements in generative AI, successive US administrations have scrutinised Nvidia's relationship with China.",
      "Washington hopes the new export controls will slow China's development of advanced AI chips - especially their use by the Chinese military - and secure an advantage in AI competition with Beijing.",
      "Why is Trump targeting Nvidia's H20 chips?",
      "US restrictions on Nvidia selling chips to China are not new.",
      "In 2022, Joe Biden's administration imposed separate export controls on the sale of advanced semiconductors to China. Nvidia specifically designed the H20 chip to comply with those existing restrictions.",
      "A more powerful Nvidia chip, the H100, was already banned for sale in China.",
      "However, the recent emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese generative AI company, has prompted fresh concerns in the US that even less powerful chips could lead to significant technological breakthroughs.",
      "DeepSeek claimed it could operate as effectively as other applications like ChatGPT using less advanced chips.",
      "Now, there is increasing demand for Nvidia's H20 chips among Chinese technology companies such as Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.",
      "Those companies have outstanding orders for the chips. But because there is no grace period on the imposition of the new curbs, Nvidia expects to be hit by losses of $5.5bn (\u00a34.15bn) from these orders that it can no longer fulfil.",
      "Chim Lee, a senior analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing, told the BBC that there are alternative AI chips being developed in China, by companies like Huawei.",
      "Although they are currently viewed as inferior to Nvidia's, Mr Lee said the US curbs could prompt China to focus on developing better chips.",
      "\"It will introduce challenges to China's AI scene, but it won't massively slow down China's AI development and deployment,\" Mr Lee added.",
      "Why is Nvidia's CEO in China?",
      "China is a critical market for Nvidia. The world's second-largest economy accounted for 13% of its total sales last year,  though that is still far less than the United States, which accounted for nearly half.",

These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale.",
      "Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.",
      "It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades.",
      "Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US.",
      "With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US.",
      "The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success.",
      "That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden \u2013 an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.",
      "Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas.",
      "TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island.",
      "But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions.",
      "\"This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,\" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. \"The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build.\"",
      "And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.",
      "Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?",
      "Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that \"they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan\".",
      "\"The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,\" he says. \"Today, Taiwan has far more capacity.\"",
      "The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.",
      "TSMC was the pioneer of the \"foundry model\" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies.",
      "Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing.",
      "\"Could the US make chips and create jobs?\" asks Mr Einstein. \"Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not.\"",
      "One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India.",
      "\"Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US.",
      "\"That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.\"",
      "The global knock-on effect",
      "Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector.",
      "\"It's a wrench in the machine \u2013 a big wrench,\" says Mr Einstein. \"Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan.\"",
      "The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US.",
      "Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small.",
      "\"China ultimately will want to win \u2013 it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,\" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot.",
      "\"If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.\"",
      "In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US \u2013 it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good.",
      "India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water \u2013 chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.",
      "Bargaining chips",
      "Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector.",
      "Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying.",
      "Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, \"I'm a very flexible person,\" adding that \"there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.\"",
      "Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips.",
      "\"I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,\" says Mr Einstein.",
      "\"I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here \u2013 TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie.\"",
      "But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale \u2013 it will take time.",
      "Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of creating an \"impression\" of a ceasefire while still taking military actions in some places in Ukraine.",
      "In the first six hours of the \"Easter truce\" - as ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin - Zelensky said there had been 387 shellings and 19 assaults by Russian forces, and drones used 290 times. There are no reports of casualties.",
      "Putin ordered his forces to \"stop all military activity\" in Ukraine from 18:00 Moscow time (16:00 BST) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday. Kyiv said it would also adhere.",
      "The BBC in Ukraine reports that it has been quieter on the front lines.",
      "Because Putin's ceasefire was announced minutes before it was due to take effect, an immediate, complete pause was always unlikely, but it has been quieter.",
      "Before Zelensky said there had been continued attacks in some areas, at midnight on Saturday there were no reported Russian drones or fighter jets in Ukrainian skies.",
      "That is very rare.",
      "The only report was that a Russian ship with missile launchers had been deployed to the Black Sea.",
      "In the southern city of Odesa, it was silent. On Friday, before Moscow's announcement, air defences crackled throughout the night as Russian drones flew in from the direction of occupied Crimea.",
      "On Sunday morning, Zelensky said Moscow was \"trying to create a general impression of a ceasefire, but in some places it does not abandon individual attempts to advance and inflict losses on Ukraine.\"",
      "Accusing Russia of specific military actions, Zelensky added that \"everywhere our warriors are responding as the enemy deserves, based on the specific combat situation.\"",
      "Late on Saturday - hours into the truce - Zelensky had said: \"If Russia is now suddenly ready to truly engage in a format of full and unconditional silence, Ukraine will act accordingly - mirroring Russia's actions.\"",
      "\"Our actions are and will be symmetrical. The proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day silence remains on the table \u2014 the answer to it must come from Moscow,\" he wrote on X.",
      "Zelensky said Ukraine would be ready to extend a truce beyond 20 April, seemingly referring to an earlier proposal from the US for a 30-day ceasefire which Ukraine had already agreed to.",
      "It seems now both Moscow and Kyiv want to show Washington they are serious about peace. The question of whether the Kremlin accepts Zelensky's offer to turn this truce from a 30-hour one to a 30 day one is central to any potential path to peace.",
      "Few Ukrainians think that is remotely possible.",
      "Putin announced the temporary truce at a meeting with his chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov.",
      "\"Based on humanitarian considerations... the Russian side announces an Easter truce. I order a stop to all military activities for this period,\" Putin told Gerasimov.",
      "\"We assume that Ukraine will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.\"",
      "The Russian defence ministry said its troops would adhere to the ceasefire provided it was \"mutually respected\" by Ukraine.",
      "It is not the first time a pause in fighting has been suddenly announced - a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 fell apart after both sides failed to agree on a proposal.",
      "Reacting to Putin's truce announcement, a Foreign Office spokesman in the UK said: \"Now is the moment for Putin to truly show he is serious about peace by ending his horrible invasion and committing to a full ceasefire, as the Ukrainian government has called for - not just a one day pause for Easter.\"",
      "Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides.",
      "The US has been directly talking to Russia as part of its efforts to end the war, but has struggled to make major progress.",

      "Saturday's protests addressed a number of Trump actions, including those by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - Trump's initiative to cut US government jobs and other spending - and the administration's unwillingness to bring about the return of \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda, a citizen of El Salvador.",
      "Gihad Elgendy told CNN he joined the protest at the White House to criticise the deportation of \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda. He believes Trump \"could easily pressure El Salvador to bring him back\".",

      "During celebrations of the anniversary in Massachusetts that commemorated the battles of Lexington and Concord and the famous horse ride of Paul Revere, people held similar signs. There was also a 50501 demonstration in Boston on Saturday.",
      "\"This is a very perilous time in America for liberty,\" Thomas Bassford, told the Associated Press, while in Boston with his partner, daughter and two grandsons. \"I wanted the boys to learn about the origins of this country and that sometimes we have to fight for freedom.\"",

      "His approval rating in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll similarly dipped to 43% from 47% on Inauguration Day. In the same poll, only 37% approved of his performance on the economy, compared to 42% during inauguration.",
      "Earlier this month, hundreds of thousands of Americans gathered for the largest nationwide show of opposition since Trump returned to the White House.",
      "Those protests - which were larger than Saturday's - happened in 1,200 locations in all 50 US states.",

      "The city of Nay Pyi Taw covers at least four times the area of London, but with only a fraction of the people. Its history is short: it has only existed since 2005, raised out of the flatlands by the then military rulers of Myanmar, which was previously known as Burma.",
      "The name Nay Pyi Taw means \"seat of the king\". The reasons for moving the capital some 370km inland from the largest city, Yangon, have never been entirely clear.",
      "The city bears all the hallmarks of a planned capital: the road leading from parliament to the presidential palace is 20 lanes wide, but carries hardly any traffic. Shiny shopping malls and empty luxury hotels line the boulevards. There's a safari park, a zoo, and at least three stadiums.",

    "summary": "Rakhaldas Banerjee is credited with discovering Mohenjo-daro, but his legacy is tainted by controversy.",
    "story": [
      "An Indian archaeologist, whose career was marked by brilliance and controversy, made one of the world's greatest historical discoveries. Yet he remains largely forgotten today.",
      "In the early 1900s, Rakhaldas Banerjee (also spelled Banerji) unearthed Mohenjo-daro - meaning \"mound of the dead men\" in the Sindhi language - in present-day Pakistan. It was the largest city of the thriving Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilisation, which stretched from north-east Afghanistan to north-west India during the Bronze Age.",
      "Banerjee, an intrepid explorer and talented epigraphist, worked for the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) when the country was under British colonial rule. He spent months travelling to distant corners of the subcontinent, looking for ancient artefacts, ruins and scripts.",
      "But while his discovery of Mohenjo-daro was ground-breaking, Banerjee's legacy is clouded by disputes. His independent streak and defiance of colonial protocols often landed him in trouble - tainting his reputation and perhaps even erasing parts of his contribution from global memory.",
      "Interestingly, Banerjee's reports on Mohenjo-daro were never published by the ASI. Archaeologist PK Mishra later accused then ASI chief John Marshall of suppressing Banerjee's findings and claiming credit for the discovery himself.",
      "\"The world knows Marshall discovered the civilisation's ruins and it is taught in institutions. Banerjee is an insignificant footnote,\" Prof Mishra told the Times of India newspaper.",
      "In her book, Finding Forgotten Cities: How the Indus Civilization Was Discovered,  historian Nayanjot Lahiri writes that Banerjee \"lacked diplomacy and tact and displayed a high-handedness that ruffled feathers\". Her book also sheds light on the controversies he was embroiled in during his time at the ASI.",
      "She notes how once, he attempted to procure inscriptions and images from a museum in north-east India without the approval or knowledge of his boss.",
      "Another time, Banerjee attempted to relocate some stone sculptures from a museum in Bengal to the one he was stationed at without the necessary permissions.",
      "In another instance, he purchased an antique painting for a sum without consulting his superiors who thought he'd paid more than was necessary.",
      "\"Banerjee's many talents seemed to include being always able to rub people the wrong way,\" Lahiri writes.",
      "But Banerjee remains a prominent figure among world historians and scholars in Bengal because of his connection with Mohenjo-daro.",
      "He was born in 1885 to a wealthy family in Bengal.",
      "The medieval monuments that dotted Baharampur, the city he grew up in, kindled his interest in history and he pursued the subject in college. But he always had an adventurous streak.",
      "Once, when he was tasked with writing an essay about the Scythian period of Indian history, he travelled to a museum in a neighbouring state to study first-hand sculptures and scripts from that era.",
      "In her book, The Life and Works of Rakhaldas Banerji, author Yama Pande notes how Banerjee joined the ASI as an excavation assistant in 1910 and rose quickly within the ranks to become a superintending archaeologist in western India in 1917.",
      "It was in this post that he first set eyes on Mohenjo-daro in Sindh in 1919. In the following years, he conducted a series of excavations at the site that revealed some of the most fascinating finds: ancient Buddhist stupas, coins, seals, pots and microliths.",
      "Between 1922 and 1923, he discovered several layers of ruins that held clues about various urban settlements that had emerged in the region, but most importantly, the oldest one that had existed some 5,300 years ago - the Indus Valley Civilisation.",
      "At that time, historians had not yet discovered the full scale of the Indus Civilisation which, we now know, covered an expanse of approximately 386,000 sq miles (999,735 sq km) along the Indus river valley.",
      "Three seals from Banerjee's excavation bore images and scripts similar to those from Harappa in the Punjab province in present-day Pakistan. This helped establish a link between the two sites, shedding light on the vast reach of the Indus Valley civilisation.",
      "But by 1924, Banerjee's funds for the project had dried up and he was also transferred to eastern India. He had no further contact with the site, nor did he participate in any excavations there, Pande writes in her book.",
      "But Nayanjot Lahiri notes that Banerjee was transferred at his own request, after becoming entangled in questions over his spending. He had failed to account for several job-related expenses.",
      "It was also revealed that Banerjee had used excavation grants to buy office furniture and his travel expenses were deemed excessive.",
      "His explanations failed to convince his superiors and disciplinary action was recommended. After some negotiation, Banerjee was granted his request and transferred to another region.",
      "Banerjee continued to work with the ASI in eastern India. He spent most of his time in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and oversaw the restoration work of many important monuments.",
      "He resigned from the ASI in 1927, but his departure was marred by controversy. In the years prior to his departure, he became the prime suspect in a case of idol theft.",
      "It all started in October 1925, when Banerjee had visited a revered Hindu shrine in Madhya Pradesh state that housed a stone idol of a Buddhist goddess. Banerjee was accompanied by two low-ranking assistants and two labourers, Lahiri notes in her book.",
      "However, following their visit, the idol went missing, and Banerjee was implicated in its theft. He denied any involvement in the disappearance and an investigation was launched.",
      "The idol was later recovered in Calcutta. Though the case against Banerjee was dismissed and the charges were found to be unsubstantiated, Marshall insisted on his resignation.",
      "After leaving the ASI, Banerjee worked as a professor, but faced financial difficulties because of his lavish lifestyle.",
      "Historian Tapati Guha-Thakurta told the Telegraph newspaper that Banerjee splurged on good food, horse carriages and friends. In 1928, he joined the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) as a professor. He died just two years later at the age of 45.",

      "\"We ran away. The strikes came one after the other, then everything was on fire,\" one man who said he worked there told the channel.",
      "On Thursday afternoon, Houthi health ministry spokesman Anees al-Asbahi said the death toll had reached 74, adding that rescue teams were still searching for casualties.",
      "Al-Masirah had earlier cited local health authorities as saying many of the dead were workers at Ras Isa. It also reported that five paramedics were killed in secondary US strikes as they arrived at the scene.",
      "The casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but graphic footage from Al-Masirah appeared to show at least 10 charred bodies near the burning tankers, including one driver, as well as men being treated for serious burns in hospital.",

      "The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid.",
      "Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.",

    "published": "Sat, 19 Apr 2025 22:58:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Spanish police use an algorithm to assess the risk of repeat domestic violence.  Does it work?",
    "story": [
      "In January, Lina went to the police.",
      "Her ex-partner had been threatening her at home in the Spanish seaside town of Benalm\u00e1dena. That day, he'd allegedly raised his hand as if to hit her.",
      "\"There had been violent episodes - she was scared,\" Lina's cousin Daniel recalls.",
      "When she got to the police station, she was interviewed and her case registered with VioG\u00e9n, a digital tool which assesses the likelihood of a woman being attacked again by the same man.",
      "VioG\u00e9n - an algorithm-based system - asks 35 questions about the abuse and its intensity, the aggressor's access to weapons, his mental health and whether the woman has left, or is considering leaving, the relationship.",
      "It then records the threat to her as \"negligible\", \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\" or \"extreme\".",
      "The category is used to make decisions about the allocation of police resources to protect the woman.",
      "Lina was deemed to be at \"medium\" risk.",
      "She asked for a restraining order at a specialist gender violence court in Malaga, so that her ex-partner couldn't be in contact with her or share her living space.  The request was denied.",
      "\"Lina wanted to change the locks at her home, so she could live peacefully with her children,\" says her cousin.",
      "Three weeks later, she was dead. Her partner had allegedly used his key to enter her flat and soon the house was on fire.",
      "While her children, mother and ex-partner all escaped, Lina didn't. Her 11-year-old son was widely reported as telling police it was his father who killed his mother.",
      "Lina's lifeless body was retrieved from the charred interior of her home. Her ex-partner, the father of her three youngest children, was arrested.",
      "Now, her death is raising questions about VioG\u00e9n and its ability to keep women safe in Spain.",
      "VioG\u00e9n didn't accurately predict the threat to Lina.",
      "As a woman designated at \"medium\" risk, the protocol is that she would be followed up again by a nominated police officer within 30 days.",
      "But Lina was dead before that. If she had been \"high\" risk, the police follow-up would have happened within a week.  Could that have made a difference to Lina?",
      "Tools to evaluate the threat of repeat domestic violence are used in North America and across Europe. In the UK, some police forces use DARA (Domestic Abuse Risk Assessment) - essentially a checklist. And DASH (Domestic Abuse, Stalking, Harassment and Honour-based Violence Assessment) may be employed by police or others, like social workers, to assess the risk of another attack.",
      "But only in Spain is an algorithm woven so tightly into police practice. VioG\u00e9n was developed by Spanish police and academics.  It's used everywhere apart from the Basque Country and Catalonia (those regions have separate systems, although police co-operation is nationwide).",
      "The head of the National Police's family and women's unit in Malaga, Ch Insp Isabel Espejo, describes VioG\u00e9n as \"super-important\".",
      "\"It helps us follow each victim's case very precisely,\" she says.",
      "Her officers deal with an average of 10 reports of gender violence a day. And every month, VioG\u00e9n classifies nine or 10 women as being at \"extreme\" risk of repeat victimisation.",
      "The resource implications in those cases are huge: 24-hour police protection for a woman until the circumstances change and the risk decreases. Women assessed as \"high\" risk may also get an officer escort.",
      "A 2014 study found that officers accepted VioG\u00e9n's evaluation of the likelihood of repeated abuse 95% of the time. Critics suggest police are abdicating decision-making about women's safety to an algorithm.",
      "Ch Insp Espejo says that the algorithm's calculation of risk is usually adequate. But she recognises  - even though Lina's case wasn't under her command - that something went wrong with Lina's assessment.",
      "\"I'm not going to say VioG\u00e9n doesn't fail \u2013 it does. But this wasn't the trigger that led to this woman's murder. The only guilty party is the person who killed Lina. Total security just doesn't exist,\" she says.",
      "But at \"medium\" risk, Lina was never a police priority. And did Lina's VioG\u00e9n assessment have an impact on the court's decision to deny her a restraining order against her ex-partner?",
      "Court authorities didn't give us permission to meet the judge who denied Lina an injunction against her ex-partner - a woman attacked on social media after Lina's death.",
      "Instead, another of Malaga's gender violence judges, Maria del Carmen Guti\u00e9rrez tells us in general terms that such an order needs two things: evidence of a crime and the threat of serious danger to the victim.",
      "\"VioG\u00e9n is one element I use to assess that danger, but it's far from the only one,\" she says.",
      "Sometimes, the judge says, she makes restraining orders in cases where VioG\u00e9n has assessed a woman as at \"negligible\" or \"low\" risk.  On other occasions she may conclude there's no danger to a woman deemed at \"medium\" or \"high\" risk of repeat victimisation.",
      "Dr Juan Jose Medina, a criminologist at the University of Seville, says Spain has a \"postcode lottery\" for women applying for restraining orders \u2013 some jurisdictions are much more likely to grant them than others.  But we don't know systematically how VioG\u00e9n influences the courts, or the police, because studies haven't been done.",
      "\"How are police officers and other stakeholders using this tool, and how is it informing their decision-making? We don't have good answers,\" he says.",
      "Spain's interior ministry hasn't often allowed academics access to VioG\u00e9n's data. And there hasn't been an independent audit of the algorithm.",
      "Gemma Galdon, the founder of Eticas \u2013 an organisation working on the social and ethical impact of technology \u2013 says if you don't audit these systems, you won't know if they're actually delivering police protection to the right women.",
      "Examples of algorithmic bias elsewhere are well-documented.  In the US, analysis from 2016 of a recidivism tool found black defendants were more likely than their white peers to be incorrectly judged to be at higher risk of repeat offending. At the same time, white defendants were more likely than black defendants to be wrongly flagged as low risk.",
      "In 2018, Spain's interior ministry didn't give a green light to an Eticas proposal to conduct a confidential, pro-bono, internal audit. So instead, Gemma Galdon and her colleagues decided to reverse-engineer VioG\u00e9n and do an external audit.",
      "They used interviews with women survivors of domestic abuse and publicly available information - including data from the judiciary about women who, like Lina, had been killed.",
      "They found that between 2003 and 2021, 71 women murdered by their partners or ex-partners had previously reported domestic abuse to the police.  Those recorded on the VioG\u00e9n system were given risk levels of \"negligible\" or \"medium\".",
      "\"What we'd like to know is, were those error rates that cannot be mitigated in any way? Or could we have done something to improve how these systems assign risk and protect those women better?\" asks Gemma Galdon.",
      "The head of gender violence research at Spain's interior ministry, Juan Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez-Ossorio, is dismissive of the Eticas investigation: it wasn't done with VioG\u00e9n data. \"If you don't have access to the data, how can you interpret it?\" he says.",
      "And he is wary of an external audit, fearing it could compromise both the security of women whose cases are recorded and VioG\u00e9n's procedures.",
      "\"What we know is that once a woman reports a man and she's under police protection, the probability of further violence is substantially lowered - we've no doubts about that,\" says L\u00f3pez-Ossorio.",
      "VioG\u00e9n has evolved since it was introduced in Spain.  The questionnaire has been refined, and the \"negligible\" category of risk will soon be abolished. And even critics agree it makes sense to have a standardised system responding to gender violence.",
      "In Benalm\u00e1dena, Lina's home has become a shrine.",
      "Flowers, candles and pictures of saints were left on the step. A small poster stuck on the wall declared: Benalm\u00e1dena says no to gender violence. The community fundraised for Lina's children.",
      "Her cousin, Daniel, says everyone's still reeling from news of her death.",
      "\"The family it's destroyed \u2013 especially Lina's mother,\" he says.",
      "\"She's 82 years old. I don't think there's anything sadder than to have your daughter killed by an aggressor in a way that could have been avoided. The children are still in shock \u2013 they'll need a lot of psychological help.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 19 Apr 2025 23:15:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The tycoon and Donald Trump advisor has moved his businesses from California to a mostly rural central Texas county. What do the neighbours think?",
    "story": [
      "After fleeing Silicon Valley for political and business reasons, Elon Musk is building a corporate campus in rural Texas \u2013 but his new neighbours have mixed views.",
      "Half an hour east of Austin, past the airport, the clogged-up traffic starts to melt away and the plains of Central Texas open up, leaving the booming city behind.",
      "Somewhere along the main two-lane highway, a left turn takes drivers down Farm-to-Market Road 1209. It seems like an unlikely address for a high-tech hub, but that's exactly what Elon Musk, the world's richest man and one of President Donald Trump's closest allies, hopes it will become.",
      "Court filings indicate that a large metal building finished in the last few months will be the new headquarters of X, his social media platform.",
      "A short distance away, a large logo of the Boring Company, Musk's infrastructure company, is plastered on the side of another headquarters.  And across FM 1209 is a rapidly growing SpaceX facility which manufactures Starlink satellite internet equipment.",
      "Like most technology tycoons, Musk had long made Silicon Valley his home and headquarters. Once a supporter of the Democrats, his move to Texas is part of a larger tech world trend and also appears to reflect his own transformed ideological views.",
      "Here the land is (relatively) cheap, skilled tech workers from nearby Austin are plentiful, and local laws are favourable to development.",
      "Of course, there are also specific political angles to the move.",
      "In July 2024, Musk said he was quitting California after the state passed a law prohibiting teachers from enforcing rules about notifying families when students' gender identity changes.",
      "Musk has an estranged transgender daughter and has spoken out against what he calls \"woke mind virus\" - which he describes in interviews as divisive identity politics - along with anti-meritocratic and anti-free speech ideas.",
      "And so Musk upped sticks and headed to Texas, a Republican stronghold and the fastest-growing state in the US.",
      "In addition to the cluster of buildings near Bastrop in central Texas, he has built a SpaceX facility in Cameron County, on the southern tip of Texas near the border with Mexico. SpaceX employees there have filed a petition to create a new town called Starbase. The measure will go to a vote in May.",
      "Locals in Bastrop have mixed feelings about the development.",
      "\"It's almost like we have a split personality,\" says Sylvia Carrillo, city manager of Bastrop, which has a growing population of more than 12,000. \"Residents are happy that their children and grandchildren will have jobs in the area.",
      "\"On the other hand it can feel like we are being overwhelmed by a third party and that the development will quickly urbanise our area,\" she says.",
      "Although the Musk development is technically outside of the city's limits, it's close enough that Texas laws give Bastrop's government sway over development. And, Ms Carrillo stresses, the Musk buildings are just one example of many developments springing up in a booming area.",
      "\"He's faced a backlash that is not entirely of his own creating,\" she says.",
      "\"But now that he's here and things are changing quickly, it's a matter of managing\" issues like house and land prices and the environment, she says.",
      "The Musk compound is still fairly bare-bones. The grandly named Hyperloop Plaza sits in the middle of the corporate buildings, and is home to the company-owned Boring Bodega, a bar, coffee shop, hairdresser and gift shop.",
      "On a recent windy Sunday afternoon, a video game console sat unplayed in front of a couch near a display of company T-shirts, while a few children scurried back and forth to a playground outside.",
      "The developments in Bastrop fit right into the quickening pace of activity across central Texas, where cranes perpetually loom above the Austin skyline and the housing market is a perpetual topic of conversation.",
      "The area has gone through various industry booms and busts over the years, including lumber and coal mining, says Judy Enis, a volunteer guide at the Bastrop Museum and Visitor Center.",
      "During World War Two, tens of thousands of soldiers - and around 10,000 German prisoners of war - poured in to Camp Swift, a US Army facility north of the town.",
      "\"That probably had more of an impact than Elon Musk,\" Ms Enis notes.",
      "Views of the tycoon are mixed, to say the least, and inseparable not only from his politics but also opinions on economic development, in what still is a predominately rural area.",
      "Judah Ross, a local real estate agent, says the development has supercharged population growth that started as a result of the Austin boom and accelerated during the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"I'm always going to be biased because I want the growth,\" Mr Ross says. \"But I love it here and I want to be part of it.",
      "\"If nothing else, what's good is the amount of jobs that this is bringing in,\" he says. \"In the past year,  I've sold to people working at Boring and SpaceX.\"",
      "Alfonso Lopez, a Texan who returned to the state after working in tech in Seattle, says he initially picked Bastrop figuring he would make a quick buck on a house purchase and move on.",
      "Instead, he quickly became enamoured with the town, its mix of local businesses and friendly people, and wants to stay.",
      "Mr Lopez is no big fan of Musk and is critical of some of his management practices and politics, but admires the technology his companies have built and is happy to live nearby as long as the companies are good neighbours.",
      "\"As long as they don't ruin my water or dig a tunnel beneath my house and create a sinkhole, this isn't bad,\" he says, gesturing around the metal shed housing the bodega, coffee shop and bar. \"I'll come here and watch a game.\"",
      "His concerns about water are more than theoretical. Last year The Boring Company was fined $11,876 (\u00a38,950) by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality after being cited for water pollution violations.",
      "The Boring Company initially planned to dump wastewater in the nearby Colorado River but, after local pressure, signed a deal to send the sludge to a Bastrop wastewater treatment plant.",
      "The water issues appear to have delayed housebuilding, which reportedly could include more than 100 homes for Musk employees. The planned development of homes has so far failed to materialise, however. For now, the extent of living quarters is a handful of temporary trailers behind the bodega building, surrounded by a wall, acres of Texas plain and a few horses munching grass. Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says any large-scale home building is at least a year off.",
      "In November, SpaceX applied for a free trade zone designation, which would allow it to move materials and finished products in and out of the Bastrop factory without being subject to tariffs - one of Donald Trump's signature policies.",
      "It's a common practice for manufacturers, and there are hundreds of similar zones across the country.",
      "Local officials in Texas have endorsed the proposal, saying it will boost the local economy, despite costing the county an estimated $45,000 (\u00a334,800) in revenue this year.",
      "The company is also getting an injection of $17.3m (\u00a313.4m) from the Texas government to develop the site, a grant that officials say is expected to create more than 400 jobs and $280m in capital investment in Bastrop.",
      "Few local residents wanted to directly criticise Musk when standing face-to-face with a visiting reporter. But it's a different story online, where sharper feelings shine through.",
      "\"They will ruin everything nearby,\" one resident posted on a local online forum. \"Nothing good comes with him.\"",
      "The BBC contacted SpaceX, The Boring Company and X for comment.",
      "Ms Carrillo, the city manager, says she hasn't picked up on much personal anger on the part of locals prompted by Musk's activities in Washington.",
      "But to protect Bastrop, she says, the city has recently enacted laws limiting housing density and providing for public parks - measures that she says will keep the \"historic nature\" of the well-preserved downtown while allowing for growth on the outskirts.",
      "Bastrop, she says, is a conservative, traditionally Republican place.",
      "\"His national stuff doesn't really register,\" she says. \"His companies have been good corporate citizens, and we hope it can stay that way.\"",

    "story": [
      "An 82-year-old woman who teaches the ancient Indian martial art of Kalaripayattu says she has no plans to retire.",
      "\"I'll probably practise Kalari until the day I die,\" says Meenakshi Raghavan, widely thought to be the oldest woman in the world to practise the art form.",
      "Kalaripayattu - kalari means battleground and payattu means fight - is believed to have originated at least 3,000 years back in the southern state of Kerala and is regarded as India's oldest martial art.",
      "It is not solely practised for combat or fighting; it also serves to instil discipline, build strength and develop self-defence skills.",
      "Ms Raghavan is fondly known as Meenakshi Amma -  Amma means mother in the Malayalam language - in Kerala's Vadakara, where she lives. The town is also home to other renowned exponents of the art like Unniyarcha, Aromal Chekavar and Thacholi Othenan.",
      "Meenakshi Amma occasionally performs in other cities but mainly runs her own Kalari school, founded by her husband in 1950. Her days are busy, with classes from five in the morning to noon.",
      "\"I teach about 50 students daily. My four children were also trained [in the art form] by me and my husband. They started learning from the age of six,\" she says.",
      "Kalaripayattu has four stages and it requires patience to learn the art form.",
      "Training begins with meypattu - an oil massage followed by exercises to condition the body.",
      "After about two years, students progress to kolthari (stick fighting), then to angathari (weapon combat), and finally to verumkai - the highest level, involving unarmed combat. It typically takes up to five years to master Kalaripayattu.",
      "Kung fu is believed to have adapted principles like breathing techniques and marmashastra (stimulating vital points to optimise energy flow) from Kalaripayattu, according to Vinod Kadangal, another Kalari teacher.",
      "Legend has it that around the 6th Century, Indian Buddhist monk Bodhidharma introduced these techniques to the Shaolin monks, influencing the more famous Chinese martial art.",
      "Meenakshi Amma still recalls the first time she stepped into a Kalari - the red-earth arena where the art is practised - 75 years ago.",
      "\"I was seven and quite good at dancing. So my guru - VP Raghavan - approached my father and suggested that I learn Kalaripayattu. Just like dance, the art form requires you to be flexible,\" she says.",
      "Hailing from Kerala's Thiyya community, Meenakshi Amma's guru was 15 when he and his brothers opened their own Kalaripayattu school after being denied admission elsewhere because of their low social caste.",
      "\"There was no bias when it came to girls enrolling to study Kalari - in fact, physical education was compulsory in all Kerala schools at that time. But we were expected to stop after attaining puberty,\" she says.",
      "Unlike others, Meenakshi Amma's father encouraged her training into her late teens. At 17, she fell in love with Raghavan, and they soon married. Together, they went on to train hundreds of students, often for free.",
      "\"At the time, a lot of children came from poor families. The only money he [Raghavan] accepted was in the form of dakshina or a tribute paid to the teacher,\" she says.",
      "Donations sustained the school, while Raghavan later took a teaching job for extra income. After his death in 2007, Meenakshi Amma formally took charge.",
      "While she has no plans to retire at the moment, she hopes to hand over the school  one day to her eldest son Sanjeev.",
      "The 62-year-old, who is also an instructor at the school, says he is lucky to have learnt from the best - his mother. But being her son earns no favours; he says she's still his toughest opponent.",
      "Meenakshi Amma is a local celebrity. During our interview, three politicians drop by to invite her to an awards ceremony.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 22:56:24 GMT",
    "summary": "China sits at the heart of Apple's supply chain - and has benefited hugely from it. Can they break up?",
    "story": [
      "Every iPhone comes with a label which tells you it was designed in California.",
      "While the sleek rectangle that runs many of our lives is indeed designed in the United States, it is likely to have come to life thousands of miles away in China: the country hit hardest by US President Donald Trump's tariffs, now rising to 245% on some Chinese imports.",
      "Apple sells more than 220 million iPhones a year and by most estimates, nine in 10 are made in China. From the glossy screens to the battery packs, it's here that many of the components in an Apple product are made, sourced and assembled into iPhones, iPads or Macbooks. Most are shipped to the US, Apple's largest market.",
      "Luckily for the firm, Trump suddenly exempted smartphones, computers and some other electronic devices from his tariffs last week.",
      "But the comfort is short-lived.",
      "The president has since suggested that more tariffs are coming: \"NOBODY is getting 'off the hook',\" he wrote on Truth Social, as his administration investigated \"semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN\".",
      "The global supply chain that Apple has touted as a strength is now a vulnerability.",
      "The US and China, the world's two biggest economies, are interdependent and Trump's staggering tariffs have upended that relationship overnight, leading to an inevitable question: who is the more dependent of the two?",
      "How a lifeline became a threat",
      "China has hugely benefited from hosting assembly lines for one of the world's most valuable companies. It was a calling card to the West for quality manufacturing and has helped spur local innovation.",
      "Apple entered China in the 1990s to sell computers through third-party suppliers.",
      "Around 1997, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy as it struggled to compete with rivals, Apple found a lifeline in China. A young Chinese economy was opening up to foreign companies to boost manufacturing and create more jobs.",
      "It wasn't until 2001 though that Apple officially arrived in China, through a Shanghai-based trading company, and started making products in the country. It partnered with Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronic manufacturer operating in China, to make iPods, then iMacs and subsequently iPhones.",
      "As Beijing began trading with the world - encouraged by the US no less - Apple grew its footprint in what was becoming the world's factory.",
      "Back then, China was not primed to make the iPhone. But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.",
      "He cites the example of Beijing Jingdiao, now a leading manufacturer of high-speed precision machinery, which is used to make advanced components efficiently. The company, which used to cut acrylic, was not considered a machine tool-maker - but it eventually developed machinery to cut glass and became \"the star of Apple's mobile phone surface processing,\" Mr Lin says.",
      "Apple opened its first store in the country in Beijing in 2008, the year the city hosted the Olympics and China's relationship with the West was at an all-time high. This soon snowballed to 50 stores, with customers queuing out of the door.",
      "As Apple's profit margins grew, so did its assembly lines in China, with Foxconn operating the world's largest iPhone factory in Zhengzhou, which has since been termed \"iPhone City\".",
      "For a fast-growing China, Apple became a symbol of advanced Western tech - simple yet original and slick.",
      "Today, most of Apple's prized iPhones are manufactured by Foxconn. The advanced chips that power them are made in Taiwan, by the world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC. The manufacturing also requires rare earth elements which are used in audio applications and cameras.",
      "Some 150 of Apple's top 187 suppliers in 2024 had factories in China, according to an analysis by Nikkei Asia.",
      "\"There's no supply chain in the world that's more critical to us than China,\" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook said in an interview last year.",
      "The tariff threat - fantasy or ambition?",
      "In Trump's first term, Apple secured exemptions on the tariffs he imposed on China.",
      "But this time, the Trump administration has made an example of Apple before it reversed tariffs on some electronics. It believes the threat of steep taxes will encourage businesses to make products in America instead.",
      "\"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones - that kind of thing is going to come to America,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated that last week: \"President Trump has made it clear America cannot rely on China to manufacture critical technologies such as semiconductors, chips, smartphones and laptops.\"",
      "She added: \"At the direction of the president, these companies are hustling to onshore their manufacturing in the United States as soon as possible.\"",
      "But many are sceptical of that.",
      "Will iPhones cost more because of Trump's tariffs on China?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "The thought that Apple could move its assembly operation to the US is \"pure fantasy,\" according to Eli Friedman, who formerly sat on the firm's academic advisory board.",
      "He says the company has been talking about diversifying its supply chain away from China since 2013, when he joined the board - but the US was never an option.",
      "Mr Friedman adds that Apple didn't make much progress over the next decade but \"really made an effort\" after the pandemic, when China's tightly controlled Covid lockdowns hurt manufacturing output.",
      "\"The most important new locations for assembly have been Vietnam and India. But of course the majority of Apple assembly still takes place [in China].\"",
      "Apple did not respond to the BBC's questions but its website says its supply chain spans \"thousands of businesses and more than 50 countries\".",
      "Challenges ahead",
      "Any change to Apple's current supply chain status quo would be a huge blow for China, which is trying to kickstart growth post-pandemic.",
      "Many of the reasons that the country wanted to be a manufacturing hub for Western companies in the early 2000s ring true today - it creates hundreds of thousands of jobs, and gives the country a crucial edge in global trade.",
      "\"Apple sits at the intersection of US-China tensions, and tariffs highlight the cost of that exposure,\" says Jigar Dixit, a supply chain and operations consultant.",
      "It might explain why China has not bowed to Trump's threats, retaliating instead with 125% levies on US imports. China has also imposed export controls on a range of critical rare earth minerals and magnets it has in stores, dealing a blow to the US.",
      "There is no doubt the US tariffs still being levied on other Chinese sectors will hurt, though.",
      "And it's not just Beijing facing higher tariffs - Trump has made it clear he will target countries that are part of the Chinese supply chain. For instance Vietnam, where Apple has moved AirPods production, was facing 46% tariffs before Trump hit pause for 90 days, so moving production elsewhere in Asia is not an easy way out.",
      "\"All conceivable places for the huge Foxconn assembly sites with tens or hundreds of thousands of workers are in Asia, and all of these countries are facing higher tariffs,\" Mr Friedman says.",
      "So what does Apple do now?",
      "The company is fighting off stiff competition from Chinese firms as the government pushes for advanced tech manufacturing in a race with the US.",
      "Now that \"Apple has cultivated China's electronic manufacturing capabilities, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo and others can reuse Apple's mature supply chain,\" according to Mr Lin.",
      "Last year, Apple lost its place as China's biggest smartphone seller to Huawei and Vivo. Chinese people are not spending enough because of a sluggish economy and with ChatGPT banned in China, Apple is also struggling to retain an edge among buyers seeking AI-powered phones. It even offered rare discounts on iPhones in January to boost sales.",
      "And while operating under President Xi Jinping's increasingly close grip, Apple has had to limit the use of Bluetooth and Airdrop on its devices as the Chinese Communist Party sought to censor political messages that people were sharing. It weathered a crackdown on the tech industry that even touched Alibaba founder and multi-billionaire Jack Ma.",
      "Apple has announced a $500bn (\u00a3378bn) investment in the US, though that may not be enough to appease the Trump administration for long.",
      "Given the several U-turns and the uncertainty around Trump's tariffs, more surprise levies are expected - which could again leave the company with little manoeuvring room and even less time.",
      "Mr Dixit says smartphone tariffs will not cripple Apple should they rear their head again, but regardless will add \"pressure - both operationally and politically\" to a supply chain that cannot be unwound quickly.",
      "\"Clearly the severity of the immediate crisis has been lessened,\" Mr Friedman adds, referring to last week's exemption for smartphones.",
      "\"But I really don't think this means Apple can relax.\"",

      "By 07:30, a slight figure in a pink headscarf, Dr Wissam Sukkar, is picking her way through the devastated streets of Gaza City.",
      "\"I was walking for around 50 minutes to reach our clinic,\" she explains when she is met by a local BBC journalist who helped us log her day. With virtually no fuel left in Gaza, few taxis are running.",
      "\"With our limited resources we're still trying to be here in northern Gaza through these difficult times,\" adds Dr Sukkar.",
      "The UN's World Health Organization (WHO) says that only 21 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are currently partially functional. Medical supplies are running critically low due to Israel's ongoing blockade of Gaza.",
      "The GP points out what is left of her former workplace, an MSF burns clinic that came under fire in the early weeks of the war, during street battles between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters.",
      "Her team has now converted an office towards the west of Gaza City into a clinic - and by 09:30, as Dr Sukkar is putting on her white robe, there are already some 150 people waiting outside in a tented reception area.",
      "\"Most of our patients are displaced people,\" Dr Sukkar says. \"They live in shelters, they even live in tents in the streets.\"",
      "Since a ceasefire collapsed a month ago, thousands of Gazans have once again left their homes and fled to this neighbourhood, seeking safety.",
      "With little food and clean water, there is a rise in malnutrition and diseases - from stomach bugs to scabies. The elderly and young are worst affected, and the first patients of the day are babies with viral infections.",
      "\"We receive a lot of children who suffer from upper respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea. In the shelters, there are a lot of children in the same place and a virus can spread very quickly,\" the doctor explains.",
      "One toddler has his face dotted with mosquito bites and Dr Sukkar administers some soothing cream. As cooking gas has run out, families have taken to using open fires to heat food and this has also led to an increase in serious burns.",
      "Within an hour, Dr Sukkar and three other physicians have seen dozens of patients. But there are many whom they struggle to help.",
      "\"We have more and more challenges with the huge number of patients with less and less medical supplies,\" Dr Sukkar says wearily.",
      "\"Also, we receive complicated cases, and we don't know where to refer these patients because the health system in Gaza has collapsed.\"",
      "There has been an influx in seriously wounded patients arriving at the clinic since last Sunday, when Israeli warplanes attacked al-Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza City.",
      "Israel accused Hamas of using a hospital building as a \"command and control centre\"; something the armed group denied.",
      "Al-Ahli - which was the main medical site for treating trauma in northern Gaza - can no longer accept patients. The WHO says the emergency room, laboratory, X-ray machines and pharmacy were destroyed.",
      "\"I started my treatment at al-Shifa hospital, then I got transferred to al-Ahli and they bombed it,\" says Saeed Barkat, an older man with a fractured thigh bone, who arrives at the MSF clinic on crutches.",
      "He had surgery after he was wounded by Israeli artillery fire on the shelter where he was staying late last year. He has pins in his leg, and it is swollen.",
      "\"I came here for any treatment and to follow-up,\" says Mr Barkat, as nurses change his dressing and give new painkillers.",
      "At midday, when Dr Sukkar checks on the small pharmacy at the clinic, she looks worried. Many of the shelves are bare.",
      "Israel closed all crossings to Gaza at the start of March, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release the remaining hostages it is holding. Since then, no aid has entered.",
      "\"For diabetes, we don't have insulin, we don't have treatments for epilepsy, we don't have basic medicines like anti-fever drugs,\" Dr Sukkar says.",
      "\"It's the season for skin infections and we don't have creams or ointments for bacterial infections, no medicines to treat scabies and head lice.\"",
      "The doctors are rationing the supplies that remain.",
      "\"We are doing our best so that it will be enough for the coming week,\" sums up Dr Sukkar, \"but we expect that our stock will run out in more or less two weeks.\"",
      "Soon Dr Sukkar is back in her consultation room. The rush of patients continues with many more sick children. They have coughs, fevers and stomach upsets.",
      "By 15:30, it is time to close up the clinic for the day. The four doctors here calculate that they have seen nearly 390 patients.",
      "After a long, tiring day, there is the long, tiring walk home for Dr Sukkar.",

      "The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work.",
      "In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on.",
      "\"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said.",
      "While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks.",
      "\"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said.",
      "Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts.",
      "\"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said.",
      "Agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While much of the work Neu's team does at NIOSH is research, he said that experts on his team have often been tapped to deploy to emergency responses as the agency's primary experts on topics like ventilation and contamination.",
      "He recounted several past deployments, ranging from helping hospitals around the country draw up plans to prepare for Ebola cases during the Obama administration, to helping the agency's quarantine station at Detroit's airport build an isolation room to screen passengers early during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We're involved in pretty much every response the CDC is involved in. Especially if there's some sort of engineering or ventilation component, NIOSH gets called in as that scientific expertise,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters\u00a0or fungal outbreaks.",
      "Impact on the CDC's measles response also goes beyond NIOSH. CBS News previously reported that multiple agency staff assigned to the effort had been let go.",

    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health,\" Sanders said Tuesday at a news conference with Rollins in Little Rock, Arkansas. \"We're paying for it on the front end and the back end.\"",

    "summary": "CDC experts were not made available to discuss the findings showing a rise in autism prevalence.",
    "story": [
      "One out of 31 children \u2014 more than 3% of kids \u2014 have been identified with autism, according to the latest results published Tuesday from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study that tracks trends of autism's prevalence across some communities in the U.S.",
      "\"They've again gone up dramatically, just in two years. We have in some states as low as 1 out of 20 boys having autism, 1 out of 31 kids. And when I was, in my generation today, the rate of autism was 1 in 10,000,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday in Indiana, announcing the new findings. \"And this is just one disease. This whole generation of kids is damaged by chronic disease.\"",
      "Kennedy often cites the CDC's figures from this study as evidence for his claim that the U.S. is now seeing a growing \"epidemic\"\u00a0of autism, which experts and advocacy groups have criticized as stigmatizing and misleading.",
      "\"As the report indicates, more children have access to evaluations for autism and more children are being identified as autistic. This is encouraging because when children are identified early, appropriate supports and services can be tailored to help them, and their families thrive,\" said Dr. Kristin Sohl, of the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee on autism, in a statement shared before Kennedy's remarks and the report's release.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told \"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0that the definition of what autism is has also expanded.",
      "\"It's a spectrum. It's not just one thing. ... So that's part of it,\" she said. \"We also are being much more aggressive about looking for it \u2014 pediatricians, educators.\"",
      "The definitions used in this study are also quite broad, Gounder added.",
      "\"They were looking at both health records, educational records, did a student access special ed supports, that sort of thing,\" she said. \"So part of it is the way in which we're looking for it. But there also does seem to be an underlying increase that has been occurring over time.\"",
      "For years, CDC scientists have said that the data indicating a rise in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, could be reflecting improved screening and access to autism services in some communities. However, the agency's experts were not made available for a press briefing about the latest findings, marking a change from previous years.",
      "\"Research has not demonstrated that living in certain communities puts children at greater risk for developing ASD,\" the CDC's authors said in their report.",
      "The study's authors said estimated autism prevalence was consistently higher among Asian, Black and Hispanic children compared to White children. Factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning could be contributing to this gap, the report says.",
      "Data from sites in 16 communities were collected for the new CDC report. The last report found a rate of 1 in 36 children through 2020, based on data from 11 communities.",
      "While the network's data is not nationally representative, figures from other federally-funded surveys and studies have also tracked a rise in autism's prevalence over the past two decades, accelerating in the early 2000s.",
      "\"Autistic children add value to our communities. Advocating for resources and funding to support autistic people across the lifespan is essential for a productive and healthy America,\" Sohl said in the statement.",
      "It comes as federal spending into autism research has also surged, largely going into efforts to study the biology suspected to underlie the condition. While scientists have linked up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, other factors are also suspected to play a role in changing its risk.",
      "Kennedy has said he believes \"an environmental toxin\" is causing autism, pointing to a range of potential culprits from food contaminants to vaccines.",
      "Many studies have debunked the claim that vaccines cause autism. But there is less research for some other factors that studies suggest might be linked to autism, ranging from pesticides to time between pregnancies.",
      "\"While the number of studies investigating the epidemiology of autism is increasing, most potential environmental factors have not been investigated sufficiently to draw firm conclusions,\" the federal government's autism research coordination office said in 2023.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Kennedy claimed that autism was preventable and said that it was \"unforgivable that we have not yet identified the underlying causes.\"",
      "\"We are assembling teams of world-class scientists to focus research on the origins of the epidemic, and we expect to begin to have answers by September,\" he said. Leading autism organizations have expressed skepticism over that promise and concern that he will revive debunked theories.",
      "Finding an answer to the cause or causes of autism by September is \"not realistic,\" Gounder said.",
      "\"Some of the theories include diabetes during pregnancy that might be affecting the development of the child, air pollution, exposure to micro plastics, antibiotic use and the way that changes the microbiome and the gut,\" she said. \"There's a whole bunch of different theories. And again, because it's so many different diseases actually labeled Autism Spectrum Disorder, it's going to take a while to really tease that out.\"",
      "The CDC also released a statement noting that prevalence varied widely between different sites in the study. That variation \"could reflect differences in availability of services for early detection, evaluation, and diagnostic practices,\" Dr. Karyl Rattay, head of the CDC's Division of Human Development and Disability, said.",
      "CDC delayed report, barred agency experts from media",
      "The CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities was initially planning to release the report in March this year, multiple officials told CBS News. Its publication was pushed back by CDC officials amid a department-wide pause on communications ordered by the Trump administration.",
      "Plans to make the agency's experts available to explain and interpret the results were also scrapped, said multiple CDC officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Ahead of the agency's last release of autism figures in 2023, CDC scientists appeared at press briefings and interviews with media outlets about the report.",
      "That year, news outlets were also provided with embargoed copies of the report ahead of time to give journalists time to prepare their reports and interview experts. This longstanding practice has also now been abandoned agency-wide under the Trump administration, officials said, both for the autism report and many other studies published by the agency.",
      "The CDC and HHS did not respond to requests for the embargoed report, or to make any experts available for an interview.",
      "Most of the communications staff working with the center have also been laid off, officials said, as part of Kennedy's sweeping restructuring of the department this month.",
      "The branch responsible for producing the autism figures is one of the few teams remaining on the job in the CDC's birth defects and disabilities center.",

      "Mr. Trump on Thursday took aim at Powell\u00a0in a social media post, writing that the Fed should be cutting interest rates, and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "In a speech delivered on Wednesday, Powell\u00a0warned\u00a0that the Trump administration's trade war could result in a combination of higher inflation and slower growth. That economic mix describes stagflation \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that characterizes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",

And in March, the White House dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "Even if Mr. Trump were able to remove Powell, it's not clear that doing so would change the direction of the central bank's decisions on interest rates. Those calls are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC \u2014 a 12-member group tasked with setting monetary policy \u2014 and not at Powell's discretion.",
      "Who would replace Powell?",

    "story": [
      "President Trump took aim at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, writing in a social media post that Powell should be cutting interest rates and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments on his social media app, Truth Social, come after Powell delivered a speech on Wednesday that warned of the potential consequences of the Trump administration's trade war, while reiterating that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now.",
      "The Fed has put the brakes on interest rate cuts this year due to sticky inflation, which has remained higher than its target growth rate of 2% per year.",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Trump has introduced a series of tariffs on major trading partners that economists say could reignite inflation. Powell highlighted those risks on Wednesday in saying that the Trump administration tariffs could create a \"challenging scenario\" for the U.S. that requires both managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy.",
      "Those types of conditions describe \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",
      "In his social media post, Mr. Trump on Thursday pointed to the European Central Bank, which cut rates by 0.25 percentage points after the president posted his message.",
      "\"The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, 'Too Late' Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete 'mess!'\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose boardmembers could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "\"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the court ruled\u00a0in the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he wouldn't step down if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "In a meeting Thursday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Mr. Trump said of Powell, \"Oh, he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll be out of there.\"",
      "Mr.\u00a0Trump nominated Powell\u00a0to lead the Fed in 2017, and Powell was re-nominated by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",

In December, he said that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials.",
      "Whether the White House chooses to respect the Fed's independence remains to be seen.

In March, the White House also dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "\"The President appears to be moving closer to justifying removal of Democrats on the Federal Reserve Board.

    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 18:20:33 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has suggested stripping Harvard of its tax-exempt status, a step that experts say would be unusual and face  legal challenges.",
    "story": [
      "The battle between President Trump and Harvard University has moved to a new front, with the IRS now considering whether to revoke the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status.",
      "A final decision has not yet been made by the IRS, CBS News' Aaron Navarro reports. But the effort comes after Mr. Trump on Tuesday\u00a0suggested that Harvard could lose its tax exemption. The tax agency's move to consider whether to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The IRS has awarded tax-exempt status to almost 2 million organizations, ranging from universities like Harvard to charities such as churches and foundations. The designation exempts these groups from paying federal income taxes, while donations to these groups are considered tax-deductible by the IRS.",
      "Mr. Trump's scrutiny of Harvard's tax status comes after the university on Monday rejected his administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration this week moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard.",
      "The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding at other\u00a0top universities\u00a0as it exerts pressure on the institutions' policies governing student expression on campus and academic programs.",
      "But stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is an unusual step, especially for an institution the size and reputation of Harvard, experts said.",
      "\"It would be historically unprecedented,\" Brian Galle, professor of tax policy at Georgetown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Certainly no major research university has ever lost its tax exemption.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Why is Harvard tax exempt?",
      "Organizations that have a purpose deemed to be \"charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals\" can qualify for tax-exempt status, according to the IRS.",
      "Most private and public universities and colleges have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS because of their educational mission, which the federal government has recognized for their importance in fostering the productivity and civic contributions of American citizens, the Association of American Universities says.",
      "Can Mr. Trump order the IRS to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status?",
      "Not legally, according to Sam Brunson, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and an expert on federal income tax and nonprofit organizations.",
      "That's because Congress in 1998 passed a law that forbids the president from directing the IRS to audit or investigate taxpayers, he explained. If Mr. Trump instructed the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, \"that runs exactly contrary to law,\" Brunson said.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said, \"Any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the President, and investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior\" to Mr. Trump's social media post this week questioning Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Could the IRS remove Harvard's tax exemption?",
      "The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, and it occasionally exercises that power. But that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements, like neglecting to file an annual information return for more than three consecutive years.",
      "One famous case involved a university losing its tax-exempt status, Galle and Brunson noted. In the 1970s, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, a Christian institution, lost its tax-exempt status due to a policy that banned interracial relationships.",
      "That case ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1983 that the IRS was correct in depriving Bob Jones of the status because its rules had violated a \"fundamental national public policy\" about racial discrimination in education.",
      "The IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy either by failing to crack down on protestors rallying against Israel's actions in Gaza or by refusing to comply with the Trump administration's push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Brunson said. But both he and Galle expressed skepticism that such rationales would hold up in court, partly because universities have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, while also representing issues that are far different from the practices that Bob Jones engaged in.",
      "\"There isn't a society-wide agreement that allowing protests on your campus is inconsistent with fundamental public policy,\" Galle said.",
      "He added, \"Let's be clear: There is absolutely no basis for Harvard to lose its exemption. Zero.\"",
      "What happens if the IRS strips Harvard of its tax-exempt status?",
      "The IRS would first do an investigation and then inform Harvard of its reason for removing its tax-exempt status, Brunson said. Harvard could then file an appeal to the IRS. If that appeal failed, the university could then take the issue to the courts.",
      "As the case proceeded, it's likely that a court would issue an injunction or order to halt the IRS' decision, which means that Harvard would likely continue to operate as a tax-exempt institution until the case was resolved, experts said.",
      "\"Harvard isn't going to lose this \u2014 they have the money and the resources and the alumni to get the best people representing them,\" Brunson said. He predicted that Harvard would win a court case and \"set a precedent.\"",
      "How could losing tax-exempt status affect Harvard?",
      "Harvard could take a financial hit if it were to lose the tax-exempt status. But the extent of any resulting damage would be unclear given that Harvard could use tax strategies to lower its taxable income, similar to how major corporations rely on sophisticated techniques to reduce their tax liability. For instance, Harvard could lower its taxable income by deducting business costs, including its faculty salaries.",
      "By contrast, donors to Harvard could feel the impact because they wouldn't be able to deduct their contributions to the university from their own taxes. That could make it less palatable for donors to make large financial contributions.",
      "\"The biggest cost would be reduced donations,\" Brunson said. \"And the other cost is its endowment, which would no longer be tax exempt.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment stands at $52.3 billion, making it the biggest among all U.S. universities.",
      "What does Harvard say about the risk to its tax-exempt status?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Harvard reiterated that such a decision would be illegal.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status.\"",

    "story": [
      "The federal food stamp program is facing scrutiny in some states that want to block enrollees from using their government benefits to buy soda and candy.",
      "Three Republican-led states \u2014 Arkansas, Idaho and Indiana \u2014 on Tuesday moved to ban purchases of soda and candy with benefits provided by the Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Those states have a combined total of roughly 1 million residents on SNAP out of the program's total 41.7 million U.S. participants.",
      "Other states are also likely to restrict SNAP recipients' food purchases, experts say. Lawmakers in states including Arizona, Kansas and Tennessee\u00a0have introduced similar measures to curtail food stamp purchases of sugary foods and drinks.",
      "The rationale for such legislation is the view that blocking low-income Americans from using food stamps on soda and candy will help improve their health. But anti-hunger advocates say that these restrictions will add to negative perceptions of receiving food aid, while also being unlikely to improve recipients' eating habits.",
      "\"It's stigmatizing to say, 'You who are low income, we don't trust you to make the right choices,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, the SNAP deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger research group.",
      "Instead, she said, these states would be better off focusing on the biggest obstacle to healthy eating: the high cost of groceries, particularly the expense of fresh fruits and vegetables.",
      "Because SNAP provides an average individual monthly benefit of $187, or a little over $6 per day, many recipients fill up by purchasing the cheapest, most calorie-dense foods they can afford, she added.",
      "Grocery costs soared during the pandemic, surging almost 24% from 2020 to 2024 and outpacing overall inflation by almost three percentage points, according to an analysis from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Food prices aren't expected to drop anytime soon, with the USDA forecasting that groceries could rise 2.7% in 2025, adding to the challenges SNAP recipients face in affording healthy food.",
      "Make America healthy again?",
      "In announcing plans to block food stamp purchases of soda and candy, Idaho Governor Brad Little on Tuesday\u00a0proclaimed that the state \"welcomes the MAHA movement,\" referring to the \"make America healthy again\" movement started by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders credited the Trump administration with placing \"a laser focus on solving America's chronic disease epidemic,\" saying that banning candy and soda from food stamp purchases is \"a great place to start.\"",
      "About 80 cents of every $1 in SNAP benefits is used to purchase staples like meat, bread, milk, cereal and rice, with the remainder going to salty snacks, candy and sweetened beverages. Households that rely on food stamps have very similar patterns of spending to households not on food stamps, according to the Brookings Institution.",
      "The Arkansas plan, which would take effect in July 2026, would exclude soda, including no- and low-calorie soda; fruit and vegetable drinks with less than 50% natural juice; \"unhealthy drinks;\" candy, including confections made with flour, like Kit Kat bars; and artificially sweetened candy.",
      "It also would allow participants to use benefits to buy hot rotisserie chicken, which is excluded from the program now under the SNAP program's longstanding ban on hot foods. Food stamp recipients also would be barred from using their benefits to buy nonfood items, such as soap or toothpaste, as well as alcohol or tobacco.",
      "Some industries are pushing back against the SNAP restrictions. Representatives for American Beverage accused state and federal officials of \"choosing to be the food police rather than take truly meaningful steps to lift people off SNAP with good-paying jobs.\"",
      "The National Confectioners Association called the approach \"misguided.\"",
      "\"SNAP participants and non-SNAP participants alike understand that chocolate and candy are treats \u2014 not meal replacements,\" spokesman Chris Gindlesperger said.",
      "\"Taxpayers are subsidizing poor health\"",
      "Over the past two decades, lawmakers from both political parties have proposed halting SNAP payments for everything from soda to\u00a0 steak. To date, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the SNAP program, hasn't granted the required waivers for states to curb food stamp purchases.",
      "But the Trump administration is signaling that it will grant the waivers requested this week, with USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins saying in a Tuesday statement\u00a0that she plans to quickly approve Arkansas' request.",
      "\"I have said since my confirmation that USDA has a role to play in improving nutrition programs to better serve individuals in need of support, all while recognizing the generosity of the American taxpayer,\" Rollins said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our shared goal should be to lift millions of Americans out of dependency and into hopeful futures and insert new energy and ideas into long-ignored programs like diet-related, chronic disease.\"",
      "Blocking SNAP purchases of candy and soda wouldn't keep recipients from using their own money to buy such items, as food stamp benefits typically pay for roughly\u00a0two-thirds of a household's grocery costs.",
      "But advocates of banning unhealthy foods from SNAP say that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for supporting bad eating habits.",

      "\"We really wanted to do was compare where people's budget is going to get hit the hardest,\" said DeJohn, who noted that the study in not a comprehensive ranking but a snapshot of location-related shifts in the cost of groceries. \"People are noticing these costs, and they're impacting their bottom line.\"",
      "Read on to see how grocery prices\u00a0fluctuated in 12 major U.S. metros.",
      "Which cities are seeing price increases?",
      "Out of the 12 cities included in SmartAsset's analysis, Honolulu, Hawaii, experienced the largest uptick with a 5.3% increase in overall grocery prices since last year. Price hikes in Tampa Bay, Florida, are the second highest at 4.3%, followed by the Twin Cities, Minnesota, at 4.2%.",
      "When it comes to fresh produce, the Twin Cities saw the biggest spike among the 12 metro areas, with the cost of fruits and vegetables rising 6.9% from 2024. In Los Angeles, egg, meat, poultry and fish prices rose the most, at 9.8%, followed by the D.C. metro area at 9.4%.",
      "By contrast, residents of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington experienced only a modest price hike of 2.1% on eggs, meat, poultry and fish.",
      "While the report doesn't specify the factors driving price changes from city to city, a combination of influences could be at play, said SmartAsset's DeJohn. \"A big factor for something like Honolulu is it's isolated from the rest of the U.S.,\" she said. \"So, that's a good illustration of how transportation costs where you're located geographically compared to where your food is sourced can impact the prices big time.\"",
      "While price fluctuations varied from city to city, prices for egg, meats, poultry and fish went up in all metro areas, which DeJohn says were behind overall grocery cost increases across all 12 metro areas. \"As we didn't see such intense price increases across any other category of grocery, it was the egg and meat prices that were really driving the increase in grocery prices across the board in these metros,\" she said.",
      "The rise in egg prices at the metro level tracks with national BLS data. Egg prices have been climbing in large part due to the bird flu outbreak which has\u00a0forced farmers to kill infected flocks to prevent the disease from spreading.",
      "Are any cities seeing lower grocery prices?",
      "Yes. Two metro areas in SmartAsset's study \u2014 Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Boston \u2014 saw a decrease in grocery prices of 0.1% and 0.7%, respectively, from a year ago.",
      "Where are grocery prices headed?",
      "A recent analysis by the Yale Budget Lab estimates that overall food prices will rise by 2.6% in the next three years, as a result of U.S. tariffs as well as reciprocal tariffs from foreign nations in place as of April 15. Fresh produce is estimated to rise 5.4%, according to the think tank, before stabilizing at 3.6% higher.",
      "The USDA's\u00a0food price outlook, based on Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index data from this year and last, forecasts a slightly larger rise in overall food prices of 3.2%, with grocery store or supermarket food purchases, or food-at-home, increasing 2.7%.",
      "Prices for dairy products and fresh vegetables will remain mostly unchanged, according to the USDA, but unfortunately for consumers, the cost of egg prices is expected to climb. Egg prices, which have\u00a0soared over the past year, are expected to rise 57.6% in 2025, according to the report.",

    "summary": "Trump has lauded Italy's right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni as a \"fantastic leader.\" Their affinity has put pressure on the EU flag-bearer.",
    "story": [
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is meeting at the White House on Thursday with President Trump, in what her aides have called a high-stakes \"commercial peace mission.\"",
      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",
      "\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded.",
      "Meloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\"",
      "\"The goal for me is to make the West great again,\" Meloni said. \"And I think we can do it together.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he believes there have been trade calls with the EU already, and the U.S. is trying to work with the world's 15 largest economies first. The president said \"tariffs are making us rich.\"",
      "Meloni and Trump seem to \"get along great\"",
      "Meloni has positioned herself as the European leader Mr. Trump is most likely to listen to. The two have developed a relationship based on shared political and ideological affinities on issues including immigration and LGBTQ rights.",
      "Meloni was the only European leader to be invited to Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, and he has praised her multiple times, calling her a \"fantastic leader and person,\" and someone he could potentially work with to \"straighten out the world a little bit.\"",
      "After the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last year, which both leaders attended, Mr. Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying: \"I was with her a lot\" and \"we get along great.\"",
      "But the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked.",
      "Europe has hope, and anxiety, over the Trump-Meloni meeting",
      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",
      "The French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed. That statement echoed the remarks by the EU spokesperson on Monday, who noted the close coordination between Meloni and Von der Leyen ahead of the Italian leader's trip to Washington and said the \"outreach is very welcome.\"",
      "After her brief visit to Washington the Italian leader will return home, where she's expected to meet on Friday with Vice President JD Vance during his visit to the Italian capital and the Vatican.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin have met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office since he took office for his second term, but those encounters all came prior to the massive tariffs announcement on April 2.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/googles-digital-ad-network-illegal-monopoly-federal-judge/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

    "story": [
      "Shein and Temu, two popular Chinese e-commerce sites known for their low-cost items, say they will raise prices for U.S. consumers starting next week, a move that comes amid President Trump's 145% tariff on imports from China and the end of a trade loophole.",
      "The sites are popular with U.S. shoppers because of their low prices, with a focus on fast fashion. While they predominantly sell women's apparel and accessories, both also sell men's and children's clothing. Temu carries household items and small personal electronics.",
      "At Shein, women's blouses cost as little as $5, and bikinis can be found for around $10. Temu offers running sneakers for $14.",
      "Beginning April 25, though, the deals won't be as enticing for U.S. consumers. In a notice on its website, Shein told customers that \"price adjustments\" will go into effect late next week. Shein said \"recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs\" have caused its own costs to rise, making the price hikes necessary.",
      "\"We're doing everything we can to keep prices low and minimize the impact on you. Our team is working hard to improve your shopping experience and stay true to our mission: making fashion accessible for everyone,\" Shein added, without indicating the size of the price hikes.",
      "Temu posted a nearly identical notice, saying that its operating expenses have risen, and that it will therefore introduce price hikes beginning next week. Until then, prices will remain unchanged, it added.",
      "The \"de minimis\" loophole",
      "The two e-commerce sites have benefitted from a tax law loophole known as the \"de minimis\" exemption, which has allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. Mr. Trump's recent action\u00a0to eliminate the loophole beginning May 2 throws a wrench in the companies' business models.",
      "In an April 2 executive order, the White House said that shippers in China have previously used the exemption to \"hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents of shipments sent to the United States through deceptive shipping practices.\"",
      "\"These shippers often avoid detection due to administration of the de minimis exemption,\" the executive order said.",
      "Effective May 2, such shipments will be subject to \"all applicable duties,\" the order states.",
      "The end of the \"de minimis\" loophole, as well as the Trump administration's tariffs of 145% on imports from China, have dented the business models of the two platforms.",
      "The changes come at a time when American shoppers have increasingly flocked to the low-cost retailers. The number of de minimis parcels shipped to the U.S. has surged to more than 1 billion in 2023, up from 153 million in 2015, with China accounting for the largest volume of shipments, according to a January Congressional Research Service report. That year, the average package value was $54, according to the report.",

      "Small business owners worry that mounting economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's\u00a0shifting tariff policies, could shut their doors for good.",
      "Beth Benike, cofounder of Busy Baby, told CBS MoneyWatch that a lack of clarity on the direction of U.S. tariffs poses serious problems for the Oronoco, Minnesota-based retailer.",
      "\"I am a problem solver. When a decision or policy comes out, I'll find a solution. I will work with it or around it,\" said Benike, whose company makes nonslip placemats and other products for babies. \"The next day, the policy changes and that plan doesn't make sense anymore, so I come up with something else.\"",
      "Smaller enterprises that rely on imported goods and packaging from China, which now faces U.S. tariffs of as high as 145%, are among the most concerned about Mr. Trump's trade policies. But a prolonged period of economic uncertainty alone can prove fatal, obscuring future borrowing costs, dampening consumer spending, and otherwise hindering the strategic planning and managerial decision-making involved in running a small business.",
      "Trump administration officials have staunchly defended their economic policies.",
      "\"Just as it did during President Trump's first term, the administration's America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts and the unleashing of American energy will restore American Greatness from Main Street to Wall Street,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Recently, however, tremors in the economy intensified by Mr. Trump's tariffs have eroded the optimism of small businesses, according to a closely watched confidence\u00a0gauge.",
      "\"The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months,\" William Dunkelberg, chief economist of the National Federation of Independent Businesses, said in a statement.",
      "The decline in optimism comes as Mr. Trump's economic agenda roils financial markets and raises concerns about slowing U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Consumers are concerned about the inflationary effects of the tariffs hikes. They understand if\u00a0prices rise, their real spending power will go down,\" Steven J. Davis, a Stanford University economist who co-developed an economic policy uncertainty\u00a0index, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Also, some of them also feel that maybe their jobs are at risk, so for both reasons many consumers will cut back on discretionary spending.\"",
      "The cost of unpredictability",
      "To be sure, even in the best of times business owners can be caught flat-footed by abrupt changes in the competitive landscape. But risks surge when the economic climate become unpredictable.",
      "\"Uncertainty is the enemy of entrepreneurship,\" Neri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When the rules of the game are constantly shifting \u2014 one day you have a pause on tariffs, another day you don't have tariffs, if there are interest rate changes or political and economic instability \u2014 businesses cannot then confidently invest in growth.\"",
      "Smaller businesses, which typically have less of a financial cushion than larger enterprises, tend to struggle more in such an environment, she added.",
      "Davis, whose own\u00a0index\u00a0shows a spike in uncertainty in recent months, said trade policy unknowns are \"the big source of uncertainty right now inhibiting business investment and hiring.\"",
      "\"When you have tariffs, they tend to introduce cost unpredictability, which makes it very hard to predict and forecast margins accurately, especially in a product-based business,\" Karra added.",
      "Busy Baby's Benike said the sudden swerves in U.S. trade policy have made planning all but impossible.",
      "\"If I invest time, energy and money and the policy changes again in a way that makes the decision a poor one, I am already invested, the wheels are in motion and I'd be screwed,\" she said.",
      "\"I can't make a decision, so the best thing I can do is get the inventory I've paid for here and ready to sell,\" she added, referring to her latest factory order, now sitting in a Chinese warehouse.",
      "Meanwhile, the new 125% U.S. baseline tariff on Chinese imports means that Benike would owe $229,000 in duties on products worth roughly $158,000. She has launched a fundraising campaign to help cover the tariff costs.",
      "Her plan B, should the steep levies remain in place, is to continue manufacturing her products in China and to sell them to markets outside the U.S.",
      "\"There are babies everywhere. If I can't sell in America, there are other countries that are interested,\" she said.",
      "Business on the brink",
      "Kristin Bear, founder of Kilo Brava, an online lingerie and sleepwear company that sells both directly to consumers as well as to major retailers including Macy's, Nordstrom and Anthropologie, said the sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports \"wipe out our business completely\" if they stay in place.",
      "\"We have not imported anything yet with the 145% tariffs in place, but it really puts our business in complete jeopardy,\" she said.",
      "Another challenge is that U.S. factories aren't equipped to manufacture the types of garments she designs, Bear said. And because orders for garments intended for sale this fall must be placed with factories by May, it's too late to explore manufacturing options in other countries.",
      "Said Bear, noting that she can't afford to lose a whole season's worth of orders, equivalent to roughly $500,000 in sales: \"If tariffs are still in place when it's time to import them, we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company.\"",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech today that President Trump's tariffs are likely to boost U.S. inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday cautioned that the central bank could face a \"challenging scenario\" of managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy brought on by the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "In written remarks\u00a0at the Economic Club of Chicago, Powell reiterated that the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\"",
      "\"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added.",
      "Even so, Powell said the Federal Reserve can stay patient and wait to see how tariffs and other economic policies of the Trump administration play out before making any changes to interest rates. The sharp volatility in financial markets since Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2, only to put most of them on hold a week later, has led to speculation about whether the Fed would soon cut its key interest rate or take other steps to calm investors.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity\" on the impact of policy changes in areas such as immigration, taxation, regulation, and tariffs, Powell said.",
      "Powell said the inflation will likely be temporary, but \"could also be more persistent,\" echoing a concern expressed by a majority of the Fed's 19-member interest rate-setting committee in the minutes of their meeting last month.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have led economists to lower their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation this year. Because tariffs are taxes paid by importers like Walmart, they typically pass on the added costs to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"Tariffs likely lead to higher prices while softening consumer sentiment and business optimism possibly means slower growth,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, in an email. \"This is going to make economic forecasting more difficult, and the Fed is likely going to widen their bands growth and rates with risks to both price stability and full employment rising.\"",
      "Yet some splits among the Fed's interest rate-setting committee have emerged. On Monday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he expects the impact of even a large increase in tariffs to be temporary, even if they are left in place for several years. At the same time, he also expects such large duties would weigh on the economy and even threaten a recession.",
      "Should the economy slow sharply, even if inflation remained elevated, Waller said he would support cutting interest rates \"sooner, and to a greater extent than I had previously thought.\"",
      "But other Fed officials, including Neel Kashkari, president of the Fed's Minneapolis branch, have said they are more focused on fighting the effects of higher tariffs on inflation, suggesting they are less likely to support rate cuts anytime soon.",
      "For now, most recent reports suggest the economy is in solid shape. Hiring has been solid and inflation cooled in March. Yet measures of consumer and business confidence have plunged, raising concerns among economists that spending and business investment could weaken.",

    "story": [
      "Pensacola, Florida\u00a0\u2014 Emily Ley has spent the last 17 years building Simplified, her small stationery business based in Pensacola, Florida.",
      "The company produces its planners in China, but for American shoppers.",
      "\"I would love to make them here, but the U.S. simply doesn't have the infrastructure or the supply chain to do it,\" Ley told CBS News.",
      "That stationery is now subject to the recent slew of\u00a0sky-high tariffs.",
      "\"We don't have the same options as large businesses,\" Ley said. \"We don't have the same capital or ability to pivot.\"",
      "After President Trump raised tariffs on China this month,\u00a0eventually totaling 145%, Ley, with the help of the nonpartisan, conservative-funded New Civil Liberties Alliance, filed a federal lawsuit against the president, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and acting U.S. Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner Pete Flores, alleging illegal use of emergency powers illegally to enact the fees.",
      "Ley said that because Congressional approval was bypassed to impose the tariffs, she and other voters didn't have their positions represented.",
      "\"Had (Congress) had a chance to debate, discuss, vote, be involved,\u00a0I would've then had the opportunity to make my voice heard,\" she explained. \"And same for other Americans who were gonna be impacted by the tariffs. That didn't happen.\"",
      "\"If this is the end of my American dream, I'm gonna go down swinging,\" Ley said.",
      "The president has argued that the tariffs represent short-term pain that will result in long-term gain.",
      "But according to Ley, \"We can't survive the short-term pain, and especially without any sort of plan in place to create the infrastructure here...It would take years and millions and millions of dollars to build such a thing that's been built overseas over decades.\"",
      "Ley said Simplified has paid nearly $1.2 million in tariffs since Mr. Trump's first term, and is facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs.",
      "While the White House is\u00a0offering exemptions\u00a0to multibillion-dollar Chinese industries that produce smartphones and other electronics, Ley says that to just cover the cost of tariffs at 145%, she would have to raise prices on her $64 signature planner to $82. To maintain a profit on her planners, Ley would have to double the sticker price to about $120.",
      "\"I'm not paying $120 for a planner,\" Ley said.",
      "Ley employs eight other women, and disclosed that she is being forced to consider reducing salaries and possibly eliminating positions, something she says she really doesn't want to do.",
      "She says it comes down to keeping prices manageable for customers while balancing the new tariff burden on her bottom line.",
      "Ley said that China's unique manufacturing infrastructure isn't currently available in the U.S. or other countries internationally. Different elements of her planners are made in several different factories in the Shenzhen region. Because they are located close to one another, the final product is higher quality and more affordable.",
      "In response to Ley's lawsuit, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement that the president \"has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump Administration looks forward to victory in court.\"",
      "Ley says her business cannot survive such tariffs.",
      "\"That's what's terrifying,\" Ley said. \"...It's just not sustainable. And it's truly catastrophic to so many businesses, and big businesses and small businesses alike. But I really think small businesses are gonna be the casualty of this trade war.\"",

    "summary": "In these major U.S. cities, a family of three earning $100,000 would have a hard time covering basic expenses.",
    "story": [
      "Reaching the six-figure salary threshold may be considered a financial victory for many Americans, but in a many big U.S. cities the once aspirational milestone just doesn't cut it anymore.",
      "In one out of four large metro areas in the United States, a family of three with a household income of $100,000 will still struggle to get by, a LendingTree\u00a0analysis\u00a0reveals. That's a stark realization for many Americans, who continue to face\u00a0rising household expenses\u00a0on everything from\u00a0a dozen eggs to a bag of coffee. The average median household income in then U.S. was $80,610 in 2023,\u00a0according\u00a0to the most recent estimate from the Census Bureau.",
      "\"For generations of Americans, $100,000 has long been a magic number. It has been seen as a level of yearly earnings that says: You've made it. You're successful,\" according to the report. \"However, that has changed dramatically in many of the nation's biggest metros. In 25 of the 100 largest metros in this country, a six-figure household income isn't enough to handle the basics.\"",
      "In determining the metro areas where a $100,000 salary wouldn't stretch far enough, LendingTree considered eight different spending categories a typical family of three might face \u2014 such as two-bedroom apartment and infant daycare \u2014 and then subtracted the total cost from the $8,333 in monthly income the family would be earning on a salary of $100,000. That left a slew of large metro areas, from Los Angeles to New York, with negative monthly income estimates.",
      "In 25 of the 100 largest U.S. cities LendingTree looked at for its report, researchers found that monthly expenditures \u2013 which ranged from food to childcare and health insurance costs \u2013 outweighed net monthly income. The analysis didn't factor in debt payments.",
      "\"It's a rough time out there. The fact that you can make six figures in many, many cities across this country and still be broke, even before you factor in debt payments, is scary,\" said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree and author of the study. \"That's the reality for many families today, though, and unfortunately, there's not much reason to think things are going to improve anytime soon. That means that families are going to be forced to make some tough decisions and real sacrifices to get by.\"",
      "The study comes at a time when consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest levels since the pandemic, as Americans weather a period of economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's tariff rollout. Americans expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4%, up from 4.1% last month.",
      "Read on to see how your city ranked.",
      "Where is it hardest to get by on $100,000?",
      "In San Jose, the heart of California's pricey Silicon Valley, a family of three with household income of $100,000 a year would find themselves more than $2,000 short every month after covering basic expenses. Researchers say this is attributable to disproportionately high housing and transportation costs. Trailing San Jose are San Francisco and Boston which are the second and third hardest places, respectively, to get by on a $100,000 annual salary.",
      "Notably, the lion's share of locations where family breadwinners making $100,000 might still end up broke were cities on the West or East Coasts. California metro hubs figured prominently on the list, with all 10 of the state's largest cities among the top 25.\u00a0Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York also had multiple metro areas included on the list.",
      "Which cities were the most affordable for a family making $100,000?",
      "In 1 in 3 cities, however, a $100,000 salary \"is still magical,\" even for a family of three. Earners in these areas could still pocket $1,000 or more each month after paying basic expenses, LendingTree found.",
      "McAllen, Texas, located on the U.S. - Mexico border, came in at the top for places where a $100,000 salary will give you the biggest bang for your buck. Residents there would have $1,770 left over after subtracting money for their monthly expenditures. Close behind McAllen are Little Rock, Arkansas and El Paso, Texas, according to the report.",
      "For those facing stubborn costs of living, LendingTree says there are still ways to\u00a0mitigate the impact\u00a0whether it's by staying in your rental longer or reducing the interest rate you're paying.",
      "Schulz's advice for consumers: Build your emergency fund.",
      "\"Even a small emergency fund can help firm up your financial foundation. It means that your next big unexpected expense won't necessarily have to go right on to your credit card,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"Plus, online high-yield savings accounts are still offering some of the best returns in years, even though they're down from last year's highs.\"",

      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sparred Tuesday with a Federal Trade Commission attorney over the meaning of emails the Facebook founder wrote about why he wanted to acquire Instagram, as a historic antitrust trial alleging Meta illegally monopolized the social media market went into its second day.",
      "Zuckerberg returned to the witness stand on Tuesday to defend Meta's purchase of Instagram and WhatsApp, in a trial that could force Meta to divest the two apps, startups the tech giant bought more than a decade ago which have since grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "Daniel Matheson, who is leading the FTC's case against Meta, contends that Zuckerberg bought Instagram because he saw it as a threat to his company, not because he thought he could make it thrive.",
      "While questioning Zuckerberg on Tuesday morning, Matheson noted that the CEO had referred to Instagram as being a \"rapidly growing, threatening, network.\"",
      "But Zuckerberg, who is the first witness called in the trial, said while Matheson was able to show documents in court that indicated his concern about Instagram's growth, he also had many conversations about how excited his company was to acquire Instagram to make a better product.",
      "Zuckerberg pushed back against Matheson's contention that the reason for buying the company was to neutralize a threat.",
      "\"I think that that mischaracterizes what the email was,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "In his questioning of Zuckerberg, Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company.",
      "Matheson also brought up a February 2012 message in which Zuckerberg wrote to the former chief financial officer of Facebook that Instagram and Path, a social networking app, already had created meaningful networks that could be \"very disruptive to us.\"",
      "Zuckerberg testified that the message was written in the context of a broad discussion about whether they should buy companies to accelerate their own developments.",
      "The CEO was also questioned about why he bought Instagram and WhatsApp instead of building new apps.",
      "\"I'm sure we could have built an app, whether it would have succeeded or not, I think is a matter of speculation\u2026\u00a0 building a new app is hard, and many more times than not, when we've tried to build a new app, it hasn't gotten a lot of traction,\" Zuckerberg said.",
      "Zuckerberg also repeatedly disputed the government's claim that acquiring Instagram was bad for competition and for consumers.",
      "\"What I was focused on is the software infrastructure of different services that they (Instagram) can plug into. I think the explicit strategy for the Instagram integration was that we wanted to let Kevin and Mike, the founders basically tell us what services they needed from Meta in order to help improve the quality of growing Instagram faster,\" he said.",
      "The trial is one of the first big tests of President Donald Trump's FTC's ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 which was a photo-sharing app with no ads \u2014 for $1 billion in 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "Narrow market definition",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged.",
      "However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",
      "Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC's lawsuit \"defies reality.\"",
      "\"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission's action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final,\" the company said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "If you're still scrambling to get your taxes filed before the April 15 deadline, an extension can take the pressure off.",
      "Normally, the IRS recommends\u00a0that people file their income tax return as early as possible. But that's not always feasible, whether because of personal circumstances or a complicated tax situation. For those in a bind, a\u00a0tax extension\u00a0gives people an additional six months to file their federal return. The quick and free process gives Americans plenty of extra time to assemble their forms, work through complex tax situations and submit everything to the government without penalty.",
      "As of April 4, roughly 100 million people had already filed their taxes, according\u00a0to the IRS. The tax agency said\u00a0in January that it is expecting more than 140 million individual tax returns to be filed before the April 15 deadline, meaning there are likely millions of outstanding 1040s yet to be filed.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxpayers in these states have beyond April 15 to file their taxes, IRS says. Here's where.",
      "Do you know what you pay in taxes? Here's who pays the most and least to the IRS.",
      "Taxes are typically a major source of stress for Americans. In an April TaxAct survey, a quarter of respondents said one of their top concerns was filing their taxes incorrectly. Those polled also expressed uncertainty around what to expect when filing, with one-quarter of respondents saying they worried about having to pay more taxes than they'd expected.",
      "If you're planning to file a tax extension this year, here are some things to keep in mind.",
      "What is the 2025 filing deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes this year is Tuesday, April 15, by 11:59 p.m. in your local time zone. However, there are exceptions.",
      "U.S. citizens, resident aliens and members of the military on duty who live outside of the U.S. are granted an automatic extension of two months. Military servicemembers serving in combat zones are given 180 days after they leave the area to file and pay their tax returns.",
      "This year, the IRS also extended the deadline for 13 states due to natural disasters in those areas. All taxpayers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and certain locations in Alaska, New Mexico, and Virginia have until May 1 to file their returns. Taxpayers in California's Los Angeles County have until October 15. And people in Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as in certain counties in West Virginia, have until November 3 to file.",
      "How do I file a tax extension online?",
      "The IRS offers a few different ways for people to extend their tax deadline to October 15. The online payment system, which allows you to pay the IRS directly from your bank account, debit card, credit card or digital wallet, has a box you can check if you need to file for an extension.",
      "Taxpayers can also electronically request an automatic tax-filing extension while using IRS File Free, which guides taxpayers through their federal income returns using tax preparation software.",
      "Another option is to file a Form 4868, which is the Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. It asks for basic information including your name, address and Social Security number. You can file a Form 4868 electronically by using IRS e-file or mailing the form to the IRS.",
      "If I get an extension, does that mean I have more time to pay the IRS?",
      "Even if you get an extension, you are still required to pay the IRS by the regular deadline if you owe money. As the IRS says, \"an extension gives extra time to file, but it does not give taxpayers extra time to pay if they owe.\" If taxpayers want to avoid financial penalties, it's best to estimate the amount you owe and pay it by the regular deadline, which is 11:59 p.m, Tuesday, April 15.",
      "Is there a penalty for filing taxes late?",
      "Yes. The IRS charges individuals and businesses a fine if they fail to file their return by the deadline or by their extension date. The \"failure to file penalty\" is 5% of the tax due for each month the return is late and is capped at 25%.",
      "What happens if I file but don't pay?",
      "The IRS levies a fine based on the amount of taxes you didn't pay. The \"failure to pay penalty\" is 0.5% of the unpaid taxes for each month, with a cap of 25% of the unpaid taxes. You would be subject to the penalty if you file your taxes on time but don't pay by the April 15 deadline.",
      "Tax filers can avoid the \"failure to file\" and \"failure to pay\" charges if they can prove that they missed the payment due to a\u00a0reasonable cause. \"Reasonable cause is determined on a case by case basis considering all the facts and circumstances of your situation,\" the IRS says.",
      "What if I can't afford to pay the IRS?",
      "The IRS offers both a short-term and long-term payment plan for taxpayers struggling to pay what they owe to the IRS. Those interested in applying can do so on the IRS website.",

    "summary": "The case could determine whether Mark Zuckerberg's company might have to divest WhatsApp and Instagram.",
    "story": [
      "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

      "The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the AEA gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in\u00a0Colorado,\u00a0New York and southern Texas\u00a0promptly issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.",
      "But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.",
      "Judge Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting the removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet.",
      "But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday.",
      "An attorney for the Legal Aid Society said her client refused to sign papers he was given by the detention facility staff because they were in English and he could not understand what they said.",
      "Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport.",
      "With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless on Friday.",
      "\"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\"",
      "Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed\u00a0criminal contempt\u00a0by ignoring his order to turn around the planes carrying more than 200 Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated.",
      "Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then.",
      "ICE said it would not comment on the litigation.",
      "Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there.",
      "Some Venezuelans subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in its\u00a0notorious\u00a0main prison.",

      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, ordered an investigation into unauthorized disclosures in March. His memo said the investigation would seek \"a complete record\" of leaks and use polygraph tests if necessary.",
      "The two now-fired officials are Hegseth's senior advisor Dan Caldwell and deputy chief of staff Dan Selnick, the sources said. Both were put on administrative leave earlier this week pending the leak investigation, CBS News reported. Politico was first to report their termination.",
      "A third official, Colin Carroll, the chief of staff to the deputy secretary of defense, was also put on administrative leave this week amid the investigation.",
      "In a joint statement posted on X on Saturday, Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll said they were \"incredibly disappointed\" by how their service with the department ended, calling the experience unconscionable.",
      "\"Unnamed Pentagon officials have slandered our character with baseless attacks on our way out the door. All three of us served our country honorably in uniform - for two of us, this included deployments to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And, based on our collective service, we understand the importance of information security and worked every day to protect it,\" the statement read.",
      "\"At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of 'leaks' to begin with,\" they said.",
      "Kasper is also under review as part of the probe, two sources said.",
      "A senior Defense official told CBS News on Saturday: \"At this time, no final senior staffing changes have been decided, and the secretary will make any future announcements on his own timetable.\"",
      "Officials have told CBS News there are discussions about suspending more officials in what appears to be a widespread investigation into leaks to news outlets.",
      "Kasper's memo was released the same day that the Pentagon vehemently denied billionaire Elon Musk was coming to the Pentagon for a classified briefing on war plans with China, but officials say the investigation is looking at more than just one story.",

      "\"Today, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,\" a U.S. official told CBS News. \"We agreed to meet again next week and are grateful to our Omani partners for facilitating these talks and to our Italian partners for hosting us today.\"",
      "After the meeting, Araghchi said the two countries agreed to have another round of negotiations in Oman on April 26. But experts will meet there in the days before.",
      "\"The talks were held in a constructive environment and I can say that is moving forward,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television. \"I hope that we will be in a better position after the technical talks.\"",
      "U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement ahead of the talks that President Trump has been clear that Iran \"cannot have a nuclear weapon\" and that \"all options remain on the table.\"",
      "\"The president has authorized direct and indirect discussions with Iran to make this point clear, but he's also made clear this cannot go on indefinitely,\" Hughes said. \"The Trump administration's entire national security leadership team is committed to the president's posture on Iran to ensure peace and stability in the Middle East and security here at home.\"",
      "Oman's capital, Muscat,\u00a0hosted the first round of negotiations\u00a0between Araghchi and Witkoff last weekend, which saw the two men meet face to face after indirect talks.

      "That the talks are even happening represents a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis. Mr. Trump, in his first term, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, setting off years of attacks and negotiations that failed to restore the accord that drastically limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 21:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A tranche of records on Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 killing are being unsealed at the urging of the senator's son, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday started releasing the first tranche of records on Democratic Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 assassination, with roughly 10,000 pages of previously classified records.",
      "The disclosure \u2014 ordered by President Trump within days of taking office and backed by the senator's son, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 could reignite speculation about the decades-old killing, as the younger Kennedy insists his father's convicted assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, might be innocent.",
      "A CBS News review found the documents include scans of handwritten notes by convicted assassin Sirhan, witness interviews, crime scene and autopsy photos, FBI memos related to Sirhan and his whereabouts before the shooting, correspondence to the government from the American public in reaction to the assassination, and interviews with Sirhan's family.",
      "Many of the details shared in the files were already known.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the release, which began Friday, comes after an effort done in conjunction with the National Archives and other agency officials to scan and upload more than 10,000 pages, which will be available for the American people to view online \"to fulfill President Trump's maximum transparency promise.\"",
      "The records will be published with limited redactions for privacy reasons, such as to shield Social Security numbers, she said.",
      "Gabbard said that an additional 50,000 pages of files related to Robert F. Kennedy's killing were discovered during searches of CIA and FBI warehouses for documents that had not been turned over to the Archives. Agencies are working to make those documents available and will continue searching government facilities for more, according to the director of national intelligence.",
      "What did the RFK files say?",
      "The documents released so far appear to include Justice Department and FBI memos, as well as photos of evidence collected during the investigation into Robert F. Kennedy's assassination and clippings from news reports. Some scanned records are difficult to read, as are handwritten notes included in the tranche.",
      "Some of Sirhan's apparent notes viewed by CBS News include messages like \"RFK must be disposed of like his brother was\" and \"My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more [and] more of an unshakeable obsession.\" Other notes from Sirhan expressing hatred for Robert F. Kennedy have been publicly known for decades and were referenced at his trial.",
      "Also in the files: A 1968 FBI memo that offered an assessment of Sirhan, including that he fell from a horse and sustained a head injury in 1966, and family members said his behavior changed markedly afterward.",
      "A June 12 FBI memo describes Robert F. Kennedy's widow Ethel Kennedy's \"distraught\" reactions to the shooting, with one ambulance worker recounting she told him, \"keep your hands off him,\" and another witness saying she knocked over a TV news camera and hit a reporter in the chest at the hospital.",
      "Some of the documents detail eyewitness interviews about both Sirhan and the shooting. A few of those records touch on longstanding conspiracy theories about the assassination. There are references to witnesses seeing a woman in a polka-dot dress or somebody shouting \"we shot him,\" which often features in theories about the shooting, though other witnesses say they didn't spot anybody matching that description.",
      "What could the new RFK files reveal?",
      "It's unclear what new information on the 1968 slaying could emerge from the disclosures, several experts told CBS News before the documents were released. Robert F. Kennedy's killing was primarily investigated and prosecuted by local officials in Los Angeles, and files from that investigation \u2014 along with many records from a parallel FBI probe \u2014 have been publicly available in California's state archives for decades with few omissions. It's not clear if other federal agencies hold records tied to the assassination.",
      "The administration has also vowed to release files on Rev. Martin Luther King's 1968 assassination, and it published troves of declassified files on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 killing in March.",
      "Why did Trump release RFK files \u2014 and is RFK Jr. involved?",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to unseal records on King, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy in late January. In an April 10 cabinet meeting, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the King and Robert F. Kennedy files would be ready within days, including what she described as decades-old documents that \"have never been scanned or seen before.\"",
      "\"Nearly 60 years after the tragic assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the American people will, for the first time, have the opportunity to review the federal government's investigation thanks to the leadership of President Trump,\" Gabbard said in a statement. \"My team is honored that the President entrusted us to lead the declassification efforts and to shine a long-overdue light on the truth. I extend my deepest thanks for Bobby Kennedy and his families' support.\"",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he's \"very grateful\" for the release.",
      "The health secretary \u2014 who was 14 years old when his father was assassinated \u2014 has shown an interest in the case for years, doubting the conclusion that Sirhan was responsible for his father's killing. Breaking with many of his siblings, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. backed Sirhan's 2021 request for parole after meeting with Sirhan in prison.",
      "Who killed RFK?",
      "Sirhan was arrested shortly after the 1968 assassination, which took place at the Ambassador Hotel while Robert F. Kennedy was running for president, and convicted of murder. He has admitted to killing the senator and linked it to Robert F. Kennedy's backing of Israel, though at other points, he has denied responsibility or said he couldn't remember the incident.",
      "Sirhan's requests for parole have been repeatedly rejected. California's parole board backed his 2021 bid for early release, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom overrode their decision.",
      "Still, the case has drawn waves of public attention, as some critics \u2014 including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 claim Sirhan didn't fire the fatal shots or other parties were involved in the killing. Skeptics typically cite issues with eyewitness testimony or the alleged presence of extra bullets at the crime scene \u2014 though other researchers have backed the view that Sirhan acted alone.",

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may \"move on\" from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days. Months of efforts by the White House have failed to bring an end to the fighting, despite repeated promises by President Trump before he took office that he would use his skills as a negotiator to end the war immediately.",
      "Rubio spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested that could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.",
      "\"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters upon departure. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"",
      "\"It's not our war,\" Rubio said. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\"",
      "His remarks contrasted starkly with the stance of the Biden administration, during which then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned not long after the war began that Russia's autocratic President Vladimir Putin was determined \"to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. And short of that, he'd like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also warned, including in multiple interviews with CBS News, that Putin is intent on expanding Russia's borders by force \u2014 and breaking the security bonds forged among Western democracies during World War II, of which the U.S.-led NATO alliance has been the most tangible.",
      "\"For him, we are a satellite of Russian Federation. At the moment, it's us, then Kazakhstan, then Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News' Charlie D'Agata about one year ago. \"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members.\"",
      "Zelenskyy called Russia's invasion a war \"against the democracy, against the values, against the whole world,\" acknowledging even then that some in the West might be tired of hearing that message, \"but only those are tired who are not at war, who don't know what war is, and who have never lost his or her children.\"",
      "\"If we do not stand firm, he will advance further,\" Zelenskyy reiterated in an interview with 60 Minutes just this month. \"It is not just idle speculation; the threat is real. Putin's ultimate goal is to revive the Russian empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war.\"",

      "Rubio's comments on Friday came hours after the U.S. and Ukraine seemingly neared a long-delayed deal to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Trump's peace push.",
      "\"We have a minerals deal,'' Mr. Trump said Thursday, and Ukraine's economy minister said Friday that the two countries had signed a memorandum of intent ahead of a possible fuller agreement later.",
      "The deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term cooperation.",
      "Work toward the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Negotiations have since resumed.",
      "Rubio on the dialogue with Russia, and Europe",
      "Despite apparent growing U.S. impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday's Paris talks constructive. \"Nobody rejected anything, nobody got up from the table or walked away.\"",
      "Rubio didn't single out Russia or Ukraine as blocking peace efforts. He said he informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the outlines that emerged when they spoke after the Paris talks, but wouldn't say how Lavrov reacted.",
      "When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details but said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were scheduled in the coming days.",
      "\"Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this,\" he said.",
      "In its readout on the call with Rubio, the Kremlin said Lavrov had confirmed Moscow's \"readiness to continue working together with American colleagues to reliably eliminate the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.\"",
      "Putin and his deputies have consistently claimed those root causes are Zelenskyy's actions and NATO's eastward expansion \u2014 misleading narratives that Mr. Trump himself has at times espoused about the full-scale invasion Putin launched on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "After weeks of tension with European allies, Rubio told reporters in Paris that the European negotiators proved helpful. \"The U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this.\"",
      "During a meeting on Friday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome, Vice President JD Vance also spoke about the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine and Russia, saying he wouldn't \"pre-judge them, but we feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war to a close.\"",
      "European concerns are growing, however, about Mr. Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia. These talks were the first time since his inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials met to discuss an end to the war, which has posed the biggest security challenge to Europe since World War II.",
      "The meetings addressed hypothetical security guarantees for Ukraine in the future, but Rubio wouldn't discuss any possible U.S. role in that. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again if and when a peace deal is reached.",
      "Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Putin, Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Mr. Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.",
      "Deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine continue",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.",
      "One person died and 103 others, including eight children, were wounded as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early on Friday, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. He said cluster munitions struck a \"densely populated\" neighborhood four times.",
      "Russian drones also targeted a bakery in Sumy, less than a week after the deadly Palm Sunday strike there, killing a customer and wounding an employee, the regional prosecutor's office said. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor.",
      "Last Sunday's strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelenskyy's hometown of Kryvyi Rih.",

      "Just two days after being named interim IRS commissioner, Gary Shapley is out of the job, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "His roughly 48 hours heading the agency where he's spent most of his career was marked by an internal struggle involving billionaire Elon Musk, who backed Shapley taking the job, according to two sources familiar with the dispute.",
      "Shapley's appointment to the agency's top post triggered a series of back-channel discussions. Sources have told CBS News they centered on Musk's role in bypassing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's authority to have Shapley \u2014 best-known for speaking out about alleged political influence in the Hunter Biden tax probe \u2014 installed in the post.",
      "Bessent complained to President Trump that Shapley had been installed at the urging of Musk and sought Mr. Trump's approval to undo the decision, according to multiple sources.",
      "Deputy Treasury Secretary Michael Faulkender \u2014 who is now the agency's acting head, a Treasury spokesperson confirmed \u2014 also voiced concerns with Shapley's appointment, and Bessent sided with Faulkender, multiple sources said.",
      "The New York Times was the first to report Shapley's ouster Friday.",
      "Bessent voiced support for Faulkender's appointment in a social media post Friday afternoon, saying, \"trust must be brought back to the IRS\" and calling Faulkender \"the right man for the moment.\"",
      "Shapley is expected to continue serving as an adviser to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, sources said. Bessent also confirmed that Shapley will continue working at the Treasury Department.",
      "\"Gary Shapley's passion and thoughtfulness for approaching ways by which to create durable and lasting reforms at the IRS is essential to our work, and he remains among my most important senior advisors,\" Bessent wrote.",
      "Shapley was placed at the top of the IRS while President Trump's pick for the job, Billy Long, has been awaiting Senate confirmation. Long, a former congressman from Missouri, has faced questions about his qualifications.",
      "A former supervisor at the agency, Shapley became famous after speaking out about the Hunter Biden tax case. Shapley was a supervisory special agent in his 14th year at the IRS when he came forward in a 2023 interview with CBS News chief investigative correspondent Jim Axelrod. He alleged internal misgivings about improper pressure to go easy on former President Joe Biden's son.",
      "Shapley was one of two IRS whistleblowers to testify before Congress about alleged misgivings in the Hunter Biden probe. The IRS agents alleged the Department of Justice \"slow-walked\" the investigation and told them not to probe leads related to Joe Biden. They were removed from the case and temporarily sidelined with pay.\u00a0 Hunter Biden later pled guilty to tax crimes and was pardoned by his father.",
      "Shapley and another agent who said they faced retaliation after blowing the whistle to Congress and speaking out to CBS News about their investigation have already retained high ranking positions in the Trump administration. Shapley was initially assigned to Bessent's office as a senior adviser for IRS reform, and later named deputy director of criminal investigations at the agency.",

    "summary": "Food safety inspections would be left to state and local authorities under the plan being developed by the FDA.",
    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is drawing up plans that would end most of its routine food safety inspections work, multiple federal health officials tell CBS News, and effectively outsource this oversight to state and local authorities.",
      "The plans have not been finalized and might need congressional action to fully fund, said the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "\"The claim that the FDA is suspending routine food safety inspections is false. FDA is actively working to ensure continuity of operations during the reorganization period and remains committed to ensuring critical programs and inspections continue,\" an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Some FDA employees have been working on a possible shift of the agency's routine food efforts to states for years, one current and one former official said, which could free up resources to focus on higher priority and foreign inspections. The FDA already outsources some routine food inspections through contracts with 43 states and Puerto Rico.",
      "\"There's so much work to go around. And us duplicating their work just doesn't make sense,\" one former FDA official, who worked on the plans before leaving the agency and spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "Multiple federal health officials said that the state work currently is often reserved for lower-risk inspections. A third of routine food safety inspections were done by states over recent years, a Government Accountability Office report said earlier this year.",
      "The FDA is ultimately responsible for the safety of much of the U.S. food supply that's distributed over state lines, like packaged products, seafood, eggs and produce. Some kinds of meat are regulated by a different agency inside the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Some higher-risk routine food inspections would likely remain at the FDA under the plans, two officials said. For example, agency staff currently conduct annual visits to infant formula manufacturers, which are overseen separately as \"critical foods\" inspections. States would also not be able to take on the work of routine inspections in foreign food facilities.",
      "It is unclear what would happen for the states that do not have contracts with the FDA to conduct food inspections, which range from Hawaii to Delaware.",
      "In addition to routine inspections, the FDA also does other kinds of inspections in response to issues, like a visit to a Colorado onion processor last year linked to the McDonald's Quarter Pounders outbreak that turned up dozens of violations.",
      "Internal planning around the possibility of outsourcing its routine inspections first picked up after 2010, the former FDA official said, when the agency was working on implementing major food safety legislation passed that year.",
      "The official likened the plans to the FDA's Grade A Milk Safety Program, where states fund the majority of oversight work themselves and have agreements with the agency to standardize how the industry is regulated.",
      "Some states and advocacy groups have called for years for the FDA to move its routine food inspections out to states. States can often do inspections at a lower cost than the FDA, while meeting the same standards, they have argued.",
      "\"FDA audits have determined states inspections to be high quality, and the costs show them to be a good economic value. There is significant cost to managing two systems also,\" said Steve Mandernach, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials, in a statement.",
      "Mandernach drew a parallel to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, under which hospitals and nursing homes are largely inspected by state agencies but overseen by the federal government.",
      "He also pointed to how the FDA regulates produce farms. The FDA has agreements with most states to pay for routine inspections conducted by local agriculture departments, where they often handle inspections and enforcement themselves.",
      "\"Further, we implemented this type of program with produce already and it has been successful, expanding and leveraging those lessons can only provide greater value to the taxpayers, increase oversight of manufacturers, and improve food safety,\" he said.",
      "Ending the FDA's work to do its own routine food safety inspections might also help alleviate an issue elsewhere at the agency: a backlog of inspections overseas, as well as in other markets like medical products.",
      "In the past, FDA inspectors had been trained to do multiple kinds of inspections, officials said, instead of specializing only in food safety inspections.",
      "Steep layoffs at the office's support staff is expected to result in cutbacks to the number of inspections that can be done by the agency, CBS News previously reported. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has also greenlighted plans to hire contractors to attempt to plug the hole left by the laid-off workers.",
      "\"In theory, relying on states to do more routine food inspection work could lead to better food safety,\" said Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, in an email to CBS News.",
      "Gremillion cautioned that a transition in how food inspections are done by the FDA would take significant time and resources.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 09:05:36 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge said he could recommend criminal prosecutions against the Trump administration, setting up an unprecedented showdown.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg threatened on Wednesday to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt of court for defying a court order to return Venezuelan migrants en route to a Salvadoran prison last month \u2014 possibly setting the stage for an unprecedented showdown between President Trump and the judicial branch.",
      "Boasberg, who said the government \"deliberately flouted\" his orders, warned if the administration doesn't change course, he could hold hearings, recommend criminal charges and hire a private attorney to prosecute the case if the Department of Justice refuses.",
      "Why could Judge Boasberg hold the Trump administration in contempt of court?",
      "In a searing written decision, Boasberg said the Trump administration showed a \"willful disregard\" for his orders not to deport migrants under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "The government has cited the 18th-century law to fly hundreds of alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador, whose government is holding scores of U.S. deportees in a notorious maximum-security prison. The Trump administration has touted the deportations as ridding the U.S. of foreign gang members, but an analysis by \"60 Minutes\" last week showed that 75% of the men sent to CECOT in El Salvador had no criminal records. At least 22% of the men on the list have criminal records here in the United States or abroad. The vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing. About a dozen are accused of murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. It was unclear if any criminal record existed for the other 3%.",
      "Some of those migrants sued to prevent their removal last month, and Boasberg quickly ordered the government verbally to return the migrants to the United States, even if that requires officials to \"turn a plane around.\" The judge later issued a written order barring the administration from removing migrants under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg wrote Wednesday the government disobeyed those orders by not returning the migrants to the United States. Since then, he said he's given officials \"ample opportunity\" to explain what happened, but found their responses unsatisfactory.",
      "The Trump administration has denied violating the judge's order, and White House communications director Steven Cheung said the government will appeal Boasberg's ruling. \"The President is 100% committed to ensuring that terrorists and criminal illegal migrants are no longer a threat to Americans and their communities across the country,\" he wrote in a statement.",
      "As it pursues its appeal, the Justice Department has asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to\u00a0pause the district court's order, arguing that Boasberg's decision was \"fundamentally misconceived from the start, needlessly prompting a constitutional confrontation over criminal contempt that never should have arisen.\"",
      "What is contempt of court?",
      "Under federal law, criminal contempt of court is defined as disobeying a federal court's \"lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command.\"",
      "As with any criminal case, prosecutors would need to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant \u2014 in this case, potentially a federal official \u2014 willfully violated an order, says Mitchell Epner, a partner at the New York law firm Kudman Trachten Aloe Posner.",
      "Contempt cases are extremely rare, according to Epner. He said that during his three-year stint as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, he can't recall anyone even threatening to bring a criminal contempt of court case, much less actually bringing charges.",
      "\"In my experience as a lawyer over the last 30 years, even the hint of being held in contempt by a judge is ordinarily enough in order to cause litigants to correct their behavior,\" Epner said.",
      "What happens next in this case?",
      "Before moving forward, Boasberg gave the government an opportunity to \"purge\" its alleged contempt, saying the government could take the migrants back into U.S. custody so they can potentially seek relief from a court. If the administration decides to go down that route, he gave officials one week to file court papers \"explaining the steps they have taken and will take.\"",
      "Boasberg said he is also open to other solutions.",
      "Otherwise, Boesberg says the Trump administration has one week to give the court the names of whoever \"made the decision not to halt the transfer\" of the migrants covered by his orders. If needed, Boasberg said he'll hold hearings or order depositions to gather more details.",
      "After that, Boasberg said he could recommend a criminal prosecution for contempt of court, though it's unclear who the defendant would be.",
      "However, Boasberg can't necessarily force charges to be brought. Federal prosecutions are generally handled by the Department of Justice, which has the power to decide which cases it pursues, making it highly unlikely the Trump administration will choose to criminally charge its own officials. Epner told CBS News he \"cannot imagine a circumstance\" where the DOJ chooses to bring those charges.",
      "Can Boasberg appoint a private lawyer to prosecute the administration?",
      "It's complicated. Boasberg notes that if the Justice Department decides not to bring contempt charges, he has the right to appoint a private attorney to step in and prosecute the case. That option isn't unheard-of: In one well-known 2023 case, the Supreme Court chose not to strike down a contempt conviction against lawyer Steven Donziger that was prosecuted by private attorneys.",
      "But that route is extremely unusual and would almost certainly face legal pushback, Epner says. In the small handful of situations where judges have appointed lawyers to step in and act as prosecutor, it has generally been because the DOJ simply decided bringing contempt charges wasn't worth its time, according to Epner. Boasberg's case is far thornier because it would involve a direct confrontation with federal officials.",
      "\"Actually trying to prosecute a criminal contempt here would be a mess because all of these issues would have to be unpacked,\" Epner said.",
      "Any effort to prosecute Trump administration officials privately could reach the Supreme Court, and Epner argues \"all evidence is that they are bending over in every possible supine position to avoid a showdown with Donald Trump.\" The court has already weighed in, overturning Boasberg's order on the grounds that cases should have been brought in another court district.",
      "For those reasons, Epner thinks it's unlikely that Boasberg will go with private attorneys, saying, \"it is literally setting up a constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Could the Trump administration face other contempt charges?",
      "It's unclear, though the administration has run into resistance from federal judges in other cases.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis has ordered the government to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador who the Trump administration conceded was mistakenly sent to the same Salvadoran prison as the Venezuelan migrants. In a hearing Tuesday, Xinis said the administration \"has not yet fulfilled the mandate, the order, that I issued,\" and ordered expedited discovery in the case, saying, \"there will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers have suggested the government be held in contempt. Xinis said Tuesday, \"I will have the record before me to call it like I see it\" before ruling on contempt.",

      "In a briefing with reporters on Thursday before his reenlistment ceremony, 36-year-old Meyer said he is returning to military service after 15 years out of uniform because he felt he \"had more to give.\" He's also close to President Trump's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth.",
      "But Meyer said he would refrain from politics while in uniform.",
      "\"The great part about being in the reserves is I'm still a citizen when I'm not on orders,\" he said. \"When I'm on orders I'll comply obviously with whatever the standard is.\"",
      "In brief remarks during the ceremony, Hegseth said Meyer's reenlistment is \"not common practice\" and the Marine Corps \"doesn't do things like this lightly,\" but praised Meyer's \"uncommon valor.\" Hegseth said the reenlistment shows \"you're never too old, you're never too experienced, you've never done too much that you can't continue to contribute.\"",
      "Originally from Kentucky, Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor, the military's highest honor, by then-President Barack Obama in 2011 for his heroics in Afghanistan when he charged five times in a Humvee into heavy gunfire to rescue comrades under attack by Taliban insurgents.",
      "On Sept. 8, 2009, Meyer was part of a security team supporting a patrol moving into a village in the Ganjgal Valley. Suddenly, the lights in a nearby village went out and gunfire erupted. About 50 Taliban insurgents on mountainsides and in the village had ambushed the patrol.",
      "His actions during the six-hour attack and firefight saved the lives of 36 people, both Americans and Afghans. He killed at least eight Taliban insurgents. Firing from a gun turret on top of a Humvee driven by a fellow Marine, he provided cover for his team, allowing many to escape likely death.",
      "Meyer described the events in a 2011 interview with CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" telling correspondent David Martin, \"I didn't think I was going to die. I knew I was.\"",
      "Four American soldiers died in the ambush: 1st Lt. Michael Johnson, 25, from Virginia Beach, Virginia; Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, 30, of Roswell, Georgia; Corpsman James Layton, 22, of Riverbank, California; and Edwin Wayne Johnson Jr., a 31-year-old gunnery sergeant from Columbus, Georgia. A fifth man, Army Sgt. Kenneth W. Westbrook, 41, of Shiprock, New Mexico, died later from his wounds.",
      "After leaving the military, Meyer remained in the spotlight. In 2016 he married former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's daughter, Bristol, and they had two children. Years later, in 2019, he told \"60 Minutes\" about his experience with a\u00a0new post-traumatic stress disorder treatment.",
      "He's been outspoken about the jailing of another Marine \u2014 Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller \u2014 who criticized the Biden administration for the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan in social media posts while in uniform, which is a violation of military conduct.",

      "Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen says he has met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who immigration officials say was deported by error, in El Salvador on Thursday, Van Hollen's spokesperson confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Democratic senator shared a photo with Abrego Garcia at what appears to be a restaurant.",
      "\"I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \"Tonight I had that chance. I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.\"",

      "Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele also posted photos\u00a0of the meeting, but suggested Abrego Garcia will remain incarcerated by his government, which is being paid by the United States to hold deportees: \"Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez, said in a statement after the meeting her \"prayers have been answered.\"",
      "\"We still have so many questions, hopes, and fears. I will continue praying and fighting for Kilma's' return home,\" Vasquez wrote.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai called Van Hollen's visit \"truly disgusting,\" writing, \"Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist.\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers have strongly denied any connections to MS-13.",
      "The surprise meeting with Van Hollen marks Abrego Garcia's first known appearance since last month, when his deportation to El Salvador's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center drew national attention and sparked a legal standoff with the Trump administration.",
      "The administration admitted in court papers Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador \u2014 along with hundreds of other Salvadoran and Venezuelan migrants \u2014 due to an \"administrative error.\" U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, and the Supreme Court backed up that order, but he has remained in El Salvador since then, with Xinis suggesting the government hasn't complied with her order and demanding regular updates on his status.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, arguing it's up to El Salvador to decide whether to return Abrego Garcia \u2014 an argument an appeals court called \"shocking\" on Thursday. The government has also alleged Abrego Garcia is linked to Salvadoran gang MS-13, citing a confidential informant, though his attorneys have denied that allegation and noted Abrego Garcia has not been charged or convicted of any crimes.",
      "Abrego Garcia, 29, was born in El Salvador but entered the United States illegally in 2011 at the age of 16. He was arrested outside a Maryland Home Depot in 2019, but a judge barred the government from deporting him to El Salvador, warning he could be persecuted by gangs in his home country. Years later, in March of this year, he was detained by immigration agents in Maryland and sent to the Salvadoran detention center, known as CECOT.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case is at the center of a controversial push by the Trump administration to send scores of migrants \u2014 including accused members of MS-13 and Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 to CECOT using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to deport citizens of an enemy nation during an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" The gambit has been challenged in court, with opponents decrying conditions in CECOT and\u00a0arguing the government is denying migrants the right to due process. A \"60 Minutes\" report found most of the 238 Venezuelans sent to CECOT on several planes last month had no apparent criminal record. But the Trump administration has defended its use of the law, arguing it is cracking down on gang violence.",
      "Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia\u00a0came after the senator was turned away Thursday at a military checkpoint near CECOT. He said he was about three kilometers from the notorious supermax prison, when he was stopped by soldiers, who he said were ordered to prevent him from going toward the prison.",
      "Van Hollen left for El Salvador on Wednesday, intending to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being. He provided updates on his journey.",
      "\"My overall purpose here is to send a signal that we are not going to stop fighting for his return until he is actually released,\" Van Hollen said before his flight.",

      "Mr. Trump's comments on his social media app, Truth Social, come after Powell delivered a speech on Wednesday that warned of the potential consequences of the Trump administration's trade war, while reiterating that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now.",
      "The Fed has put the brakes on interest rate cuts this year due to sticky inflation, which has remained higher than its target growth rate of 2% per year.",
      "In the meantime, Mr. Trump has introduced a series of tariffs on major trading partners that economists say could reignite inflation. Powell highlighted those risks on Wednesday in saying that the Trump administration tariffs could create a \"challenging scenario\" for the U.S. that requires both managing both accelerating inflation and a slowing economy.",
      "Those types of conditions describe \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",

      "\"The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, 'Too Late' Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete 'mess!'\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

United States.",

      "Over the years, Powell has steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. In December, he said that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court said Thursday that the Trump administration's assertions in the case of a Maryland man who it admitted was mistakenly deported to El Salvador should be \"shocking\" to all Americans and made an appeal to the executive branch to vindicate the importance of the rule of law.",
      "The brief unanimous opinion authored by Judge Harvie Wilkinson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit rejected a request from the Trump administration to pause a district judge's order that required it to facilitate the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year-old who lives in Maryland, from Salvadoran custody, and explain the steps it has taken to return him to the U.S.",
      "\"The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,\" Wilkinson, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote. \"Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\"",
      "Wilkinson was joined in his opinion by Judges Robert King, nominated by President Bill Clinton, and Stephanie Thacker, appointed by President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge acknowledged that the executive branch has \"enormous\" powers to prosecute and deport noncitizens, but warned that the administration's actions so far could put U.S. citizens at risk.",
      "\"If today the Executive claims the right to deport without due process and in disregard of court orders, what assurance will there be tomorrow that it will not deport American citizens and then disclaim responsibility to bring them home?\" Wilkinson wrote. \"And what assurance shall there be that the executive will not train its broad discretionary powers upon its political enemies?\"",
      "In his opinion, Wilkinson wrote of the tensions that can exist between the executive and judicial branches, but said that these differences require an effort at \"mutual respect.\" He lamented that \"too often today\" the executive branch has not afforded the courts that respect, and cited calls for judges to be impeached for decisions the government disagrees with, as well as pressure to disregard judicial orders.",
      "\"It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis, but it may present an opportunity as well,\" he wrote. \"We yet cling to the hope that it is not na\u00efve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos. This case presents their unique chance to vindicate that value and to summon the best that is within us while there is still time.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has exploded simmering tensions between the federal judiciary and the Trump administration, which has been undertaking a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "The Salvadoran national came to the U.S. unlawfully in 2011 and was arrested in 2019. Administration officials claim that Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13, citing allegations from a confidential informant and his attire \u2014 a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie \u2014 at the time of his arrest. Abrego Garcia's lawyers have said he is not a gang member and has never been charged with or convicted of any crime in the U.S. or El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from immigration custody in October 2019 and granted withholding of removal by an immigration judge, which is a legal status that forbids the government from deporting him back to his home country of El Salvador.",
      "He was living with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and their children in Maryland until he was arrested by immigration authorities in March and sent to El Salvador, where he and more than 200 others have been confined at the Terrorism Confinement Center, a notorious prison known as CECOT.",
      "Immigration officials in the Trump administration have acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador last month was an \"administrative error\" because of the withholding of removal, but efforts to have him brought back to the U.S. have sparked a fierce legal battle.",
      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the Trump administration earlier this month to \"facilitate and effectuate\" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, and the case landed before the Supreme Court. The high court then ruled last week that Xinis properly required the government to \"facilitate\" his release from custody in El Salvador, but said she should clarify the scope of her decision as to effectuating Abrego Garcia's return.",
      "The district judge issued an amended decision that ordered the administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody as soon as possible. She also required the government to give her information about his whereabouts, as well as what steps it was taking to bring him back to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has so far rebuffed her requests for that information, but has acknowledged that Abrego Garcia is alive and detained at CECOT. Justice Department lawyers have said they will remove \"any domestic barriers\" to his return, but they have argued the U.S. does not have the power to force the Salvadoran government to release him.",
      "In his decision, Wilkinson said the court will not \"micromanage\" Xinis' attempt to implement the Supreme Court's decision, which he acknowledged requires lower courts to give consideration to the deference owed to the executive branch when conducting foreign affairs.",
      "\"The Supreme Court's decision does not, however, allow the government to do essentially nothing,\" he wrote.",

      "The battle between President Trump and Harvard University has moved to a new front, with the IRS now considering whether to revoke the Ivy League school's tax-exempt status.",
      "A final decision has not yet been made by the IRS, CBS News' Aaron Navarro reports. But the effort comes after Mr. Trump on Tuesday\u00a0suggested that Harvard could lose its tax exemption. The tax agency's move to consider whether to strip Harvard of its designation as a 501(c)(3) organization was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The IRS has awarded tax-exempt status to almost 2 million organizations, ranging from universities like Harvard to charities such as churches and foundations. The designation exempts these groups from paying federal income taxes, while donations to these groups are considered tax-deductible by the IRS.",
      "Mr. Trump's scrutiny of Harvard's tax status comes after the university on Monday rejected his administration's demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership, including auditing the student body and faculty for \"viewpoint diversity.\" After Harvard announced its decision, the Trump administration this week moved to freeze $2.2 billion in grants for Harvard.",
      "The Trump administration has also threatened to cut off federal funding at other\u00a0top universities\u00a0as it exerts pressure on the institutions' policies governing student expression on campus and academic programs.",
      "But stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is an unusual step, especially for an institution the size and reputation of Harvard, experts said.",
      "\"It would be historically unprecedented,\" Brian Galle, professor of tax policy at Georgetown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Certainly no major research university has ever lost its tax exemption.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the issue.",
      "Why is Harvard tax exempt?",
      "Organizations that have a purpose deemed to be \"charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition and the prevention of cruelty to children or animals\" can qualify for tax-exempt status, according to the IRS.",
      "Most private and public universities and colleges have been granted tax-exempt status by the IRS because of their educational mission, which the federal government has recognized for their importance in fostering the productivity and civic contributions of American citizens, the Association of American Universities says.",
      "Can Mr. Trump order the IRS to remove Harvard's tax-exempt status?",
      "Not legally, according to Sam Brunson, a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law and an expert on federal income tax and nonprofit organizations.",
      "That's because Congress in 1998 passed a law that forbids the president from directing the IRS to audit or investigate taxpayers, he explained. If Mr. Trump instructed the IRS to remove Harvard's tax exemption, \"that runs exactly contrary to law,\" Brunson said.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the White House said, \"Any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the President, and investigations into any institution's violations of its tax status were initiated prior\" to Mr. Trump's social media post this week questioning Harvard's tax-exempt status.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Could the IRS remove Harvard's tax exemption?",
      "The IRS has legal authority to strip organizations of their tax-exempt status, and it occasionally exercises that power. But that is usually due to groups failing to meet tax requirements, like neglecting to file an annual information return for more than three consecutive years.",
      "One famous case involved a university losing its tax-exempt status, Galle and Brunson noted. In the 1970s, Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, a Christian institution, lost its tax-exempt status due to a policy that banned interracial relationships.",
      "That case ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1983 that the IRS was correct in depriving Bob Jones of the status because its rules had violated a \"fundamental national public policy\" about racial discrimination in education.",
      "The IRS could argue that Harvard is in violation of public policy either by failing to crack down on protestors rallying against Israel's actions in Gaza or by refusing to comply with the Trump administration's push against diversity, equity and inclusion policies, Brunson said. But both he and Galle expressed skepticism that such rationales would hold up in court, partly because universities have a constitutional right to freedom of speech, while also representing issues that are far different from the practices that Bob Jones engaged in.",
      "\"There isn't a society-wide agreement that allowing protests on your campus is inconsistent with fundamental public policy,\" Galle said.",
      "He added, \"Let's be clear: There is absolutely no basis for Harvard to lose its exemption. Zero.\"",
      "What happens if the IRS strips Harvard of its tax-exempt status?",
      "The IRS would first do an investigation and then inform Harvard of its reason for removing its tax-exempt status, Brunson said. Harvard could then file an appeal to the IRS. If that appeal failed, the university could then take the issue to the courts.",
      "As the case proceeded, it's likely that a court would issue an injunction or order to halt the IRS' decision, which means that Harvard would likely continue to operate as a tax-exempt institution until the case was resolved, experts said.",
      "\"Harvard isn't going to lose this \u2014 they have the money and the resources and the alumni to get the best people representing them,\" Brunson said. He predicted that Harvard would win a court case and \"set a precedent.\"",
      "How could losing tax-exempt status affect Harvard?",
      "Harvard could take a financial hit if it were to lose the tax-exempt status. But the extent of any resulting damage would be unclear given that Harvard could use tax strategies to lower its taxable income, similar to how major corporations rely on sophisticated techniques to reduce their tax liability. For instance, Harvard could lower its taxable income by deducting business costs, including its faculty salaries.",
      "By contrast, donors to Harvard could feel the impact because they wouldn't be able to deduct their contributions to the university from their own taxes. That could make it less palatable for donors to make large financial contributions.",
      "\"The biggest cost would be reduced donations,\" Brunson said. \"And the other cost is its endowment, which would no longer be tax exempt.\"",
      "Harvard's endowment stands at $52.3 billion, making it the biggest among all U.S. universities.",
      "What does Harvard say about the risk to its tax-exempt status?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Harvard reiterated that such a decision would be illegal.",
      "\"The government has long exempted universities from taxes in order to support their educational mission,\" a spokesperson wrote in an email. \"The tax exemption means that more of every dollar can go toward scholarships for students, lifesaving and life-enhancing medical research, and technological advancements that drive economic growth.\"",
      "The spokesperson added, \"There is no legal basis to rescind Harvard's tax-exempt status.\"",

    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's wife sought and received a temporary protective order against him in May 2021. The case was dismissed the following month after she failed to appear for a hearing.",
    "story": [
      "The wife of a 29-year-old Maryland man who was mistakenly deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador last month filed a protective order against him back in 2021 over allegations of domestic violence, according to court records obtained by CBS News.",
      "Jennifer Vasquez sought and received a temporary protective order in civil court against Kilmar Abrego Garcia in May 2021, per court records filed in Prince George's County District Court. The order alleges Abrego Garcia \"punched and scratched\" Vasquez, \"ripped off\" her shirt and \"grabbed and bruised\" her \u2014 though she has since said she didn't move forward with the court process because the situation \"did not escalate.\"",
      "In a court petition, Vasquez describes multiple incidents over the course of several days in May 2021. In one case, Vasquez wrote that Abrego Garcia got angry with her at a gas station, insulted her and drove very fast. Days later, Vasquez alleges Abrego Garcia yelled at her to turn off her laptop, and when she said she wasn't tired, she said he \"got angry\" and threw her laptop on the floor. She alleged she pushed him off of her, and \"he then punched\" and \"[scratched] me on my left eye, leaving me bleeding.\"",
      "Later that day, Abrego Garcia allegedly tore off Vasquez's shorts and shirt and \"grabbed me by the arm\" when she ran away, leaving a mark on her left arm. The following morning, after he allegedly didn't give her a set of car keys, she called an Uber for her and the kids because she was \"scared of him\" and \"afraid to be close to him.\"",
      "\"I have multiple photos/videos of how [violent] he can be and all the bruises he has left me,\" Vasquez wrote in the petition.",
      "At the time, the judge in the case ordered Abrego Garcia not to contact Vasquez, and to vacate their home and stay away from the home of another family member. He was also ordered to surrender firearms.",
      "The case, however, was dismissed in June 2021 after Vasquez failed to appear for a final hearing, according to court records. The two returned to living together.",
      "Abrego Garcia's legal team responded to Vasquez's protective order after the Department of Homeland Security posted it on X Wednesday, noting he hasn't been criminally convicted.",
      "\"If the government believes there is a legitimate case to be made, it should present that case in a court of law and have a judge review and decide his fate\u2014not on social media,\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers wrote. \"But that cannot happen until Mr. Abrego Garcia is returned to the United States and given full due process. These allegations, without more, prove why due process and access to counsel is so important.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Wednesday evening, Vasquez confirmed seeking the court order.",
      "\"After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated,\" Vasquez said. \"Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation. Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.\"",
      "Court records show Vasquez sought and obtained a separate temporary protective order in August 2020, also alleging domestic violence.",
      "Vasquez is a U.S. citizen and Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran national.",
      "The Trump administration has admitted that an \"administrative error\" led to Abrego Garcia's deportation on March 15, but has claimed Abrego Garcia is \"not a sympathetic figure,\" sharing Vasquez's protective order on X Wednesday.",
      "The case has prompted a string of legal wrangling that made its way to the Supreme Court, which last week upheld a lower court decision that the Trump administration be required to \"facilitate\" his release.",
      "Despite the Supreme Court's ruling, the case has appeared to languish. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has repeatedly rebuked the Trump administration for stonewalling her and not complying with her order to both provide information on Abrego Garcia's whereabouts and facilitate his return to the U.S.",
      "Abrego Garcia was among 238 Venezuelans and 23 Salvadoran migrants that were placed aboard three March 15 deportation flights to El Salvador after the White House alleged, often without evidence, that the men are members of transnational gangs.",
      "President Trump invoked the wartime 1798 Alien Enemies Act as justification for deporting many of the migrants to El Salvador. Another federal judge who had ordered the three flights to El Salvador be turned around found Wednesday that there was probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt for defying his orders.",
      "The men are reportedly being held in the notorious Salvadoran supermax prison, known as CECOT, under an agreement with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "During a White House meeting with Mr. Trump Monday, Bukele told reporters he would not be returning Abrego Garcia to the U.S., and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that same day it is \"up to El Salvador if they want to return him.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old.",
      "In 2019, he was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but an immigration judge barred his removal from the U.S. after determining that he could face persecution by gangs if deported to El Salvador. The judge granted him what is known as \"withholding of removal\" status.",
      "He was arrested again on March 12 following a traffic stop. Citing information from an informant who officials have said is credible, the Department of Homeland Security has alleged that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his family and attorneys deny. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record in the U.S. or El Salvador, according to government documents.",
      "In an interview with CBS News earlier this month, Vasquez said that Abrego Garcia is \"not a criminal. My husband is an amazing person. An amazing father.\"",

      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",

Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",

      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments on May 15 on a Trump administration request to partially enforce the president's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday said that it will hear oral arguments next month over whether the Trump administration can partially enforce an executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship while proceedings in a challenge to the directive move forward.",
      "The court said in an unsigned order that arguments on the Justice Department's request for emergency relief will take place during a special sitting on May 15. The administration has asked the Supreme Court to limit the scope of three separate injunctions that blocked implementation of President Trump's order nationwide.",
      "If the high court decides to grant the Justice Department's request, it would prevent the administration from enforcing Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship order only against the plaintiffs in the ongoing cases: seven individuals, specific members of immigrants' rights groups and residents of 22 states.",
      "The dispute over the president's attempt to unwind birthright citizenship is the latest in which the Supreme Court has been asked to intervene, with more requests expected. More than 100 cases that seek to knock down Mr. Trump's second-term policies have been filed since he returned to the White House in late January, and several have already made their way to the high court.",
      "The president's executive order on birthright citizenship was one of the first that he signed on his first day back in office and is among several directives that seek to target migrants who are in the U.S. unlawfully. The Trump administration's immigration policies have led to high-profile clashes with the courts \u2014 namely Mr. Trump's use of the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged members of a Venezuelan gang and the administration's mistaken removal of a Maryland man in the U.S. unlawfully to El Salvador.",
      "While the 14th Amendment has for more than a century been understood to guarantee citizenship to all people born in the U.S., Mr. Trump's order denied birthright citizenship to children born to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident.",
      "The president's order directed federal agencies to stop issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to children born after Feb. 19.",
      "More than half-dozen lawsuits challenging the measure were filed in courts throughout the country before it took effect, and three federal district courts in Washington, Maryland and Massachusetts each blocked the government from implementing the birthright citizenship order.",
      "Federal appeals courts in San Francisco, Boston and Richmond, Virginia, then refused requests by the Trump administration to partly block the lower court orders.",
      "The Justice Department filed emergency appeals of the three decisions with the Supreme Court in mid-March and asked it to limit enforcement of the birthright citizenship order to 28 states and individuals who are not involved in the ongoing cases. Then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said that a minimum, the Supreme Court should allow agencies to develop and issue public guidance regarding implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order while proceedings continue.",
      "Like other requests made to the Supreme Court, Harris took aim at the breadth of the injunctions issued by the district courts, which are nationwide in scope and cover states and individuals who are not involved in the litigation before them.",
      "The president and his allies have attacked judges for issuing nationwide injunctions in the slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies, and even called for some to be impeached.",
      "\"Universal injunctions have reached epidemic proportions since the start of the current administration,\" Harris wrote. \"Courts have graduated from universal preliminary injunctions to universal temporary restraining orders, from universal equitable relief to universal monetary remedies, and from governing the whole nation to governing the whole world.\"",
      "She argued that nationwide, or universal, injunctions prevent the executive branch from carrying out its work and impede Mr. Trump's ability to address what he says is a \"crisis\" at the U.S.-Mexico border.",

    "story": [
      "After nearly 11 hours of debate, the Texas House approved early Thursday a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds to help pay for private school tuition.",
      "The school choice bill was passed in an 85-63 vote \u2013 two were absent. The measure will provide taxpayer-funded education savings accounts, also known as school vouchers, allowing students in public schools to attend private institutions if accepted into the state's program.",
      "Eligibility for Texas school vouchers and funds allocation",
      "Under the bill,\u00a0students will receive $10,000 each year\u00a0if they attend a private school. Disabled students would receive up to $30,000 a year and home-schooled students would get $2,000.",
      "\"This is an extraordinary victory for the thousands of parents who have advocated for more choices when it comes to the education of their children\u2026I applaud the legislators who took a stand with the overwhelming majority of Texans who support school choice,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said.",
      "Abbott and Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows have said for months that they have more than the 76 votes required to pass the bill.",
      "\"Today marks a historic chapter for education in our state, with the Texas House passing its landmark 'Texas Two Step' proposals to deliver more education opportunities for students alongside the largest-ever increase in public school funding,\" Burrows said.",
      "The vote marks the first time since 1957 that the Texas House has approved legislation making state money available for families to use on their children's private schooling, according to the Texas Tribune.",
      "The vote took place just after 2 a.m. Thursday, after the Texas House heard 43 amendment proposals to the bill. All proposed amendments were tabled. The vote was divided between Democrats and Republicans. Out of all the votes, two Republicans joined all Democrats to vote against the bill.",
      "\"Welfare for the rich\"",
      "Texas Democrats expressed disappointment about the outcome, calling it \"welfare for the rich.\" Democrats also expressed concern that the program will hurt school districts by taking money away from them.",
      "Most state Republicans supported the legislation.",
      "\"Working families are going to be the ones who will foot the bill for this voucher scam,\" said Texas Democrats Chair Kendall Scudder. \"We're deeply disappointed in the lawmakers who chose to fall in line instead of standing up for their communities.\"",
      "The House will take a final vote later on Thursday. The bill will then go to the Texas Senate, where lawmakers will decide whether to go along with the House's changes or make their own changes.",
      "Trump weighs in",
      "Ahead of the vote, Abbott said that President Trump supported school choice as well.",
      "\"[Trump] called this morning to share his support for the Texas House passing SB 2 today,\" Abbott posted on social media.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on social media on Thursday congratulating his \"friends\" Abbott, Burrows and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick \"along with Texas Legislators for finally passing SCHOOL CHOICE, which I strongly endorsed.\"",
      "\"This is a gigantic Victory for students and parents in the Great State of Texas!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"We will very soon be sending Education BACK TO ALL THE STATES, where it belongs. It is our goal to bring Education in the United States to the highest level, one that it has never attained before.\"",
      "HB 2: Public school funding bill",
      "On Wednesday, the Texas House passed HB 2, the public school funding bill. It passed 144-4, with two absent. Republican leaders said it represents the largest increase in funding for public schools.",
      "\"Texas public schools are the backbone of our communities, and today the House delivered a historic investment to bolster public education for the next generation,\" Burrows said Wednesday. \"House Bill 2 lays the foundation for a modernized, responsive school finance system that will grow with the needs of Texas students while targeting taxpayer dollars where they'll make the greatest impact for students and teachers.",
      "Under this bill's proposals and others, the House will inject $9 billion in new money. That includes raising the basic allotment to school districts by $395. Forty percent of the new funding will go toward teacher pay raises and salary increases for other staff. The basic allotment would increase every two years.",
      "Democrats have said the state doesn't spend enough money on public education when compared to other states. Republicans, though, said they have continued to spend more money on schools.",
      "As lawmakers debate the bills, various local school districts across North Texas have passed deficit budgets because of record inflation and after Republican lawmakers left $4.5 billion for schools on the sidelines. The districts have also faced declining student enrollment, which has cost them funding as well.",

      "Don Pettit, NASA's oldest active-duty astronaut, celebrated his 70th birthday with two cosmonaut crewmates overnight Saturday, undocking from the International Space Station and plunging back to Earth in a blaze of re-entry heat to close out a 220-day expedition.",
      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",
      "Russian recovery crews and NASA personnel rushed to the spacecraft, opened the top hatch and helped carry the returning crew members to nearby recliners where flight surgeons carried out initial health checks.",
      "Ovchinin and Vagner appeared to be in good spirits, smiling, chatting with support crews and enjoying drinks and snacks. Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",
      "But there were no indications of any sort of major problem, medical or otherwise. From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",
      "In an April 16 interview with KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon, Pettit said he had more difficulty than most when returning to gravity after a long stay in space.",
      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",
      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

      "However, she learned the bag would get stowed under her seat, so Tamir wouldn't be accessible during the flight.",
      "\"My dream was to hold him up while I'm floating and say 'this is Tamir,'\" King said. To help, Sesame Street was able to ship a much smaller Tamir to King overnight.",
      "With Tamir in tow, King and the rest of the crew got familiar with the New Shepard rocket and learned more about what to expect \u2014 preparing for every scenario leading up to launch day.",
      "Launch day",
      "On Monday, launch day, the crew took an emotional ride to the launchpad, preparing for liftoff.",
      "In addition to King, pop star Katy Perry, journalist and philanthropist Lauren S\u00e1nchez, film producer Kerianne Flynn, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe and civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen were aboard the spaceflight.",
      "The crew rang the bell as they approached the capsule and took their seats inside.",
      "Shortly after liftoff, the crew made it to the edge of space with just minutes to take in the life-changing view.",
      "The total time of the spaceflight from liftoff to landing was approximately 10 minutes and 21 seconds.",
      "When King exited the spacecraft, she kissed the ground in celebration.",
      "\"I am so proud of me right now,\" she said shortly after landing. \"This was not a ride. What happened to us, this was a bona fide freakin' flight.\"",
      "She described the experience as \"peaceful\" and \"oddly quiet\" as she looked down at Earth.",
      "Shooting for the stars, King showed you can always overcome your fears.",
      "\"I stepped out of my comfort zone in a way I never thought was possible for me,\" she said. \"Now that I've done it, I really do feel I can take on anything.\"",

      "Winfrey, who has been friends with King for nearly five decades, said she was among those who encouraged the \"CBS Mornings\" co-host to accept the spaceflight invitation.",
      "\"I think life is about continuing to grow into the best of yourself and the fullest expression of yourself,\" Winfrey said. \"I know that, I felt deeply that she would regret it, and I didn't want to hear about it for the next 15 years.\"",

      "The program helps bring citizens to space in a reusable suborbital rocket system. Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, set the stage for future human spaceflights with the program when he lifted off on a capsule, named \"First Step,\" in 2021 with three crewmates.",
      "\"My expectations were high, and they were drastically exceeded. The zero G (gravity) piece may have been one of the biggest surprises because it felt so normal, it felt almost like humans evolved to be in that environment. ... It's a very pleasurable experience,\" Bezos told reporters\u00a0after the successful 2021 spaceflight.",
      "The unpiloted New Shepard capsule has space for six passengers who each have a window seat, looking out of some of the largest windows of any operational spacecraft.",
      "Blue Origin says the goal of the New Shepard program is also to advance research.",
      "\"New Shepard payload flights support a wide range of research, education, and technology development,\" the company added.",
      "How long was Gayle King and the crew in space?",
      "The journey to space and back, from liftoff to landing, lasted for about 11 minutes. Nearly three minutes into liftoff, the crew capsule separated from the booster and eventually reached the apogee, or the highest point of the flight.",
      "They floated for about 4 minutes before they made their return to Earth. First, drogue parachutes deployed followed by the main parachutes, bringing the history-making crew back down to the ground. They landed at less than 15 miles per hour, astronaut Mae Jemison, the first woman of color to travel to space, explained to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "\"New Shepard astronauts ascend toward space at more than three times the speed of sound. They pass the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the internationally recognized boundary of space 62 miles above Earth, before unbuckling to float weightless and gaze at our planet. The crew returns gently under parachutes, forever changed,\" Blue Origin\u00a0describes on its website.",

      "Unique design of Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft",
      "Blue Origin's spacecraft carries a crew of six and is fully autonomous, not controlled by a pilot on board.",
      "The crew capsule sits atop a liquid-hydrogen-fueled booster, which launches straight upwards, reaching a velocity of about 2,200 mph and subjecting the passengers to 3G \u2014 three times the normal force of gravity \u2014 before main engine cutoff, about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight.",
      "At an altitude of about 45 miles, the crew capsule is then released to continue soaring out of the lower atmosphere on its own, while the reusable booster heads back down to Earth to land on a nearby pad.",
      "About three-and-a-half minutes after lifoff, the crew capsule reaches a maximum altitude of just above 62 miles \u2014 the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale, an international body that certifies aerospace records, considers the dividing line between the discernible atmosphere and space.",
      "The crew experiences weightlessness from the moment the capsule separates from the booster until it arcs over the top of the trajectory and begins its descent. Moments after separating from the booster, passengers are able to unstrap and float about the cabin while enjoying spectacular views of Earth.",
      "After a few extraordinary minutes, though, it's time to strap in for the return home.",
      "\"It's about three minutes before the astronauts will get a warning to get back into their seats. And at that point, they have about 30 seconds. It's not going to be a rush, it's going to be very leisurely. All they have to do is be sitting in the seat and then as the G forces come on, our reentry will naturally push them back in the seat, so they have plenty of time to buckle back in,\" Gary Lai, a former Blue Origin engineer who helped design the New Shepard, said in an earlier interview with CBS News.",
      "Plunging back into the lower atmosphere, the capsule will rapidly decelerate, briefly subjecting the passengers to more than five times the normal force of gravity, before three large parachutes unfurl to slow the descent to about 16 mph. An instant before touchdown, pressurized nitrogen gas thrusters fire to slow the descent to walking pace.",
      "The New Shepard vehicle has a number of safeguards built in. It is equipped with a \"full envelope escape system\" that would propel the crew capsule away from a malfunctioning booster at any point from the launch pad on up, using an Aerojet Rocketdyne solid-fuel rocket motor embedded in the capsule.",
      "\"It will activate in a fraction of a second, it will light off and propel the capsule away from the booster to safety,\" Lai explained. \"Once it's far away, parachutes will deploy and we will execute a normal landing.\"",
      "The system is also designed to ensure a survivable landing even if two of the main parachutes fail to open and fully inflate.",

    "summary": "The ruling involving Google's online ad technology follows a similar case last year in which Google's search engine was declared a monopoly.",
    "story": [
      "Google has been branded an abusive monopolist by a federal judge for the second time in less than a year, this time for illegally exploiting some of its online marketing technology to boost the profits fueling an internet empire currently worth $1.8 trillion.",
      "The ruling issued Thursday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Virginia comes on the heels of a separate decision in August that concluded Google's namesake search engine has been illegally leveraging its dominance to stifle competition and innovation.",
      "After the U.S. Justice Department targeted Google's ubiquitous search engine during President Donald Trump's first administration, the same agency went after the company's lucrative digital advertising network in 2023 during President Joe Biden's ensuing administration in an attempt to undercut the power that Google has amassed since its inception in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Although antitrust regulators prevailed both times, the battle is likely to continue for several more years as Google tries to overturn the two monopoly decisions in appeals while forging ahead in the new and highly lucrative technological frontier of artificial intelligence.",
      "The next step in the latest case is a penalty phase that will likely begin late this year or early next year. The same so-called remedy hearings in the search monopoly case are scheduled to begin Monday in Washington D.C., where Justice Department lawyers will try to convince U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to impose a sweeping punishment that includes a proposed requirement for Google to sell its Chrome web browser.",
      "Brinkema's 115-page decision centers on the marketing machine that Google has spent the past 17 years building around its search engine and other widely used products and services, including its Chrome browser, YouTube video site and digital maps.",
      "The system was largely built around a series of acquisitions that started with Google's $3.2 billion purchase of online ad specialist DoubleClick in 2008. U.S. regulators approved the deals at the time they were made before realizing that they had given the Mountain View, California, company a platform to manipulate the prices in an ecosystem that a wide range of websites depend on for revenue and provides a vital marketing connection to consumers.",
      "The Justice Department lawyers argued that Google built and maintained dominant market positions in a technology trifecta used by website publishers to sell ad space on their webpages, as well as the technology that advertisers use to get their ads in front of consumers, and the ad exchanges that conduct automated auctions in fractions of a second to match buyer and seller.",
      "After evaluating the evidence presented during a lengthy trial that\u00a0concluded just before Thanksgiving last year,\u00a0Brinkema reached a decision that rejected the Justice Department's assertions that Google has been mistreating advertisers while concluding the company has been abusing its power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers forced to rely on its network for revenue.",
      "\"For over a decade, Google has tied its publisher ad server and ad exchange together through contractual policies and technological integration, which enabled the company to establish and protect its monopoly power in these two markets.\" Brinkema wrote. \"Google further entrenched its monopoly power by imposing anticompetitive policies on its customers and eliminating desirable product features.\"",
      "Despite that rebuke, Brinkema also concluded that Google didn't break the law when it snapped Doubleclick nor when it followed up that deal a few years later by buying another service, Admeld.",
      "The Justice Department \"failed to show that the DoubleClick and Admeld acquisitions were anticompetitive,\" Brinkema wrote. \"Although these acquisitions helped Google gain monopoly power in two adjacent ad tech markets, they are insufficient, when viewed in isolation, to prove that Google acquired or maintained this monopoly power through exclusionary practices.\"",
      "That finding may help Google fight off any attempt to force it to sell its advertising technology to stop its monopolistic behavior.",
      "The Justice Department didn't immediately comment on the judge's decision.",
      "In a statement, Google said it will appeal the ruling.",
      "\"We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools,\" said Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \"Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\"",
      "Analysts such as Brian Pitz of BMO Markets had been predicting that Google would likely lose the case, helping to brace investors for the latest setback to the company and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., whose shares declined 1% in afternoon trading. Alphabet's stock has plunged by 20% so far this year.",
      "As it did in the search monopoly case, Google and its corporate parent Alphabet vehemently denied the Justice Department's allegations. Their lawyers argued the government largely based its case on an antiquated concept of a market that existed a decade ago while underestimating a highly competitive market for advertising spending that includes the likes of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft and Comcast.",
      "The market as drawn in the Justice Department's case didn't include ads that appear on mobile apps, streaming television services, or other platforms to which internet users have increasingly migrated, prompting Google lawyer Karen Dunn to compare the government's definition a \"time capsule with a BlackBerry, an iPod and a Blockbuster video card\" during her opening statement\u00a0when the trial began last September.",
      "At trial, the Justice Department's lawyers emphasized the harm to news publishers that has arisen from Google's alleged dominance of the marketplace. Witnesses from Gannett, the publisher of USA Today and other newspapers, and News Corp., the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, testified about the difficulties they have faced and what they said was a lack of alternatives to Google's ad tech. Those companies rely on online advertising to fund their news operations and make their articles free to consumers on the internet, government lawyers have argued.",
      "Now, government is in position to try to dismantle that byzantine ad system. When the case was filed more than two years ago during the Biden administration, the Justice Department asserted Google should be forced to sell, at a minimum, its Ad Manager product, which includes the technology used by website publishers and the ad exchange.",

    "summary": "The case could determine whether Mark Zuckerberg's company might have to divest WhatsApp and Instagram.",
    "story": [
      "Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand Monday in a Washington, D.C., courtroom to defend his social media company from federal allegations that the technology giant is a monopoly.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is facing off with the Federal Trade Commission on Monday, for Day one of a landmark antitrust trial that could result in the company's breakup. For Zuckerberg, the case could determine whether the business empire he started building while still a student at Harvard University will be forced to break apart.",
      "The trial will be the first big test of the FTC's willingness under President Trump to challenge Big Tech, a long-time target of Republicans. The lawsuit was initially filed against Meta \u2014 then called Facebook \u2014 in 2020, during Mr. Trump's first term, before being amended in 2021.",
      "In its\u00a0complaint, the FTC accuses Meta of \"anticompetitive conduct,\" alleging that the company's ownership of Instagram and WhatsApp gives it excessive control of the social media market.",
      "\"There's nothing wrong with Meta innovating,\" said Daniel Matheson, lead attorney for the FTC in his opening statements for the agency Monday, \"It's what happened next that is a problem.\"",
      "During his testimony Monday, Zuckerberg defended his decision to buy Instagram and pushed back against FTC claims that he did not invest in developing the app.",
      "Purchased by Facebook in\u00a02012\u00a0and\u00a02014, respectively, Instagram and WhatsApp have grown into social media powerhouses.",
      "To restore competition, Meta must part ways with Instagram and WhatsApp, the government agency says in\u00a0court filings. The FTC also wants Meta to provide the government with prior notice for any future mergers and acquisitions.",
      "With the landmark trial underway, here's what you need to know.",
      "How long will the Meta trial last, and who will testify?",
      "The trial, which begins Monday in federal court in Washington, D.C., is expected to last several weeks.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg will preside over the case, which could see a range of witnesses including Meta CEO and founder Zuckerberg; former Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg; former Meta Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer; Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom; and executives from rival social media platforms.",
      "What is happening in court today?",
      "The FTC and Meta made their opening arguments on Monday, with witness testimony expected to start in the afternoon.",
      "In his opening statement, lead FTC attorney Matheson said Meta was struggling to compete with the fast-growing WhatsApp and Instagram platforms and in buying them, the tech giant was \"eliminating immediate threats,\" to their market.",
      "Meta said the company \"did nothing wrong\" by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta attorney Mark Hansen said in his opening statement that the two apps have grown substantially under the tech company's ownership and that there is no evidence to prove Meta is a monopoly.",
      "If Meta had monopoly power, it would exercise control over pricing in the social media space, Hansen said. But Meta's services are free, he noted. \"How can the FTC maintain this monopolization case when [Meta] has never charged users a cent,\" Hansen said.",
      "After the opening statements, Zuckerberg was the first person called to the stand to testify. His\u00a0testimony largely focused on Facebook's efforts to build a rival photo app that could compete with Instagram, before it decided to ultimately buy the company in 2012.",
      "Zuckerberg admitted Facebook was struggling with mobile users in the early 2010s. \"Our whole company had been built up to that point\" for desktop.",
      "Referencing email communications sent by the Meta executive, the FTC pointed out that Zuckerberg had been eyeing the progress of competitor Instagram. Facebook at the time was working on launching a new photo app.",
      "According to the FTC, Zuckerberg sent an email in Feb 2011 saying \"Instagram seems like it's growing quickly\" that mentioned their numbers and uploads.",
      "In 2012, Zuckerberg sent another email in which he described his rationale for buying Instagram, saying it was a good photo-sharing network, according to the FTC. At that point Facebook was \"so far behind that we don't even understand how far behind we are,\" he said, adding, \"I worry that it will take us too long to catch up.\"",
      "Zuckerberg is scheduled to return to court Tuesday morning to continue testimony.",
      "What's at stake?",
      "The showdown is the most significant legal challenge brought against Meta in the company's roughly 20-year history. If the FTC is successful, Meta could be forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. Instagram, which Meta has owned for over a decade, accounts for half of the company's overall advertising revenue.",
      "\"Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,\" Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Associated Press.",
      "\"The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn't where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets,\" she added.",
      "Meta, headquartered in Menlo Park, California, earned over $164 billion in revenue in 2024. Facebook and Instagram are the two most profitable social media platforms in the world.",
      "In a statement issued Sunday, April 13, Meta said the \"stakes could not be higher in this trial for U.S. consumers and businesses.\"",
      "What is Meta saying?",
      "The social media company has called the FTC's case \"weak\" and said it \"ignores reality,\" adding that it faces stiff competition from TikTok and YouTube. Both platforms outrank Facebook and Instagram in terms of how long users spend on each.",
      "\"Ultimately, an ill-conceived lawsuit like this will make companies think twice before investing in innovation, knowing they may be punished if that innovation leads to success,\" Meta's statement reads. \"On top of it, this weak case is costing taxpayers millions of dollars.\"",
      "\"The FTC's lawsuit against Meta defies reality,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others.\"",
      "\"Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The FTC did not reply to a request for comment.",
      "When did this case get started?",
      "The history of the Meta case stretches back several years. The FTC initially filed the suit in 2020 during President Trump's first term in office.",
      "In June 2021, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg dismissed the antitrust lawsuit brought by the FTC, claiming the lawsuits were \"legally insufficient\" and did not supply sufficient evidence to prove Facebook was a monopoly.",
      "But the federal judge later cleared the path for the case to proceed after the FTC introduced more evidence in an amended complaint, according to The Washington Post.",

    "story": [
      "When Aaron Friar, 50, and daughter, Ellie Friar, 15, vanished from their Medford, Oregon, home on Oct. 2, 2017, investigators quickly deduced that there was foul play.",
      "\"They saw blood spatter behind the couch, on the ceiling, all the way across the room,\" said lead Detective Bill Ford. \"There was \u2026 a potential that this was what we could refer to as a no-body homicide. That there had been a homicide, but we don't have a body.\"",
      "But who was dead? Was it Aaron Friar, Ellie or both?",
      "Natalie Morales investigates the pair's mysterious disappearance in \"First Love, Then Murder\" an all-new \"48 Hours\" now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "The search was on.",
      "\"We probably had 70, 75 [officers] out on the streets of Medford,\" says Ford.",
      "Then, just four hours after she had been reported missing, Ellie was located by police. She was alive, unharmed, and had been walking down a busy street with two young men: her boyfriend, Gavin MacFarlane, 19, and Gavin's friend, Russell Jones, 22.",
      "\"So, now we know Ellie is safe,\" said Ford.",
      "But what about her father, Aaron Friar?",
      "Based on the bloody crime scene at the house, time was quickly running out to find him. But could Ellie have been involved? Ford kept an open mind.",
      "Ellie and the two men were separated and brought to the Medford Police station for questioning. Ellie seemed perplexed when she was told by police that her father was missing.",
      "\"I haven't been home and now I'm really concerned about what's been going on,\" Ellie told a detective.",
      "She even offered a suggestion as to where her dad might be: \"Maybe he was looking for me.\"",
      "Around that time, Ford began interviewing Russell Jones.",
      "\"He's a talker \u2026 very, very talkative,\" said Ford. \"So, I kind of knew if I could get in there and get him talking, he would \u2026 have a hard time keeping his mouth shut.\"",
      "Ford's theory was correct.",
      "Jones was eager to talk, but he wanted something first: a cigarette.",
      "\"I talk better when I have a cigarette,\" Jones told Ford during his taped police interview.",
      "Ford took Russell outside of the station for a cigarette break.",
      "\"Just kind of smokin' and jokin' is what we call it,\"\u00a0 Ford explained.",
      "But Ford was serious about the task at hand: finding Aaron Friar.",
      "\"I look at him and I'm like, 'You know, Russell, I don't want a child to find Aaron, Ellie's dad, out there somewhere, come across something like that,'\" Ford recalls saying. \"I said, 'Can you take us to Aaron?' And he didn't beat an eye. He's just like, 'Yeah, I'll take you to him.'\"",
      "Ford was shocked: \"Holy smokes! That's a big moment, you know?\"",
      "He immediately loaded Jones into his police car.",
      "As the veteran investigator and his suspect began their drive, Jones confessed to Ford.",
      "\"He ends up saying he wasn't responsible for Aaron's death, but he helped load the body,\" Ford recalled.",
      "\"You're driving along with him, now he's starting to sing like a canary,\" said Morales.",
      "\"Exactly,\" Ford replied.",
      "But who had killed Aaron Friar and why?",
      "As their journey continued, Ford says Jones began going off on tangents. But Ford says he didn't mind. It was all part of his plan.",
      "\"Keep talking, keep him happy,\" said Ford. \"He even asked for another cigarette \u2026 and I said, 'You've had two already. Once we get out there, I'll give you another one.' And that's a tactic.\"",

      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",
      "Russian recovery crews and NASA personnel rushed to the spacecraft, opened the top hatch and helped carry the returning crew members to nearby recliners where flight surgeons carried out initial health checks.",
      "Ovchinin and Vagner appeared to be in good spirits, smiling, chatting with support crews and enjoying drinks and snacks. Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",
      "But there were no indications of any sort of major problem, medical or otherwise. From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",
      "In an April 16 interview with KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon, Pettit said he had more difficulty than most when returning to gravity after a long stay in space.",
      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",
      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

      "\"The more people come out, the quicker the government will change,\" protester Jim Coleman said. \"There's a lot of energy. People are very upset right now.\"",

      "Tiru Chabba, a 45-year-old father of two, was killed in the shooting, according to a law firm representing the family.",
      "Chabba was on the FSU campus Thursday for his job as an employee of a campus vendor when the gunman opened fire, attorney Bakari Sellers of the Strom Law Firm said in a statement on Friday afternoon.",
      "Chabba is survived by his wife and two children.",
      "\"Tiru Chabba's family is going through the unimaginable now,\" Sellers said in a statement. \"Instead of hiding Easter eggs and visiting with friends and family, they're living a nightmare where this loving father and devoted husband was stolen from them in an act of senseless and preventable violence.\"",
      "\"We ask you to keep his family in your thoughts and prayers as we fight to ensure they see justice that honors the memories of Mr. Chabba and all the victims of Thursday's shooting.\"",

The staff said at that time that all patients were in stable condition, with one of them in fair condition due to the extent of their injuries.",

      "\"The minute I got shot, I remember my parents telling me I just need to play dead,\" Askins told CBS News. \"So I released all the muscles in my body, I closed my eyes, I held my breath. I did everything I could to look like I was dead because I didn't want him to shoot me again. God forbid.\"",

      "\"It was just calm,\" she said. \"[He] literally said, 'Yeah, keep running.'\"",
      "Help eventually arrived. Askins said the moment a police officer began tending to her injuries, she knew she had survived the worst.",
      "According to Dr. Brett Howard, a trauma surgeon and the surgery team's leader, the hospital was notified about the shooting shortly before noon Thursday and leadership and medical staff immediately prepared for however many victims they needed to treat.",
      "\"The hardest part of it all is not knowing how many patients you're going to get,\" he said, adding that TMH staff was very proactive with its communication systems in place and activated the necessary resources by bringing additional staff to prepare for the worst.",
      "Howard said that the proximity of the hospital to the university also helped with the fast response and immediate treatment, adding that all six patients were seen within an hour of admission. He also highlighted that the relationship between hospital staff, law enforcement, and first responders also helped make the process go smoothly.",
      "Out of the six patients, three were brought into the operating room for surgery, with two of them needing abdominal surgery and the third needing facial surgery.

      "The U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday temporarily blocked the deportations of any Venezuelans held in northern Texas under an 18th-century wartime law.",
      "In a brief order, the court directed the Trump administration not to remove Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet Detention Center \"until further order from this court.\"",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.",
      "The high court acted overnight following an emergency appeal from the American Civil Liberties Union, contending that immigration authorities appeared to be moving to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act (AEA) of 1798. The Supreme Court had said earlier in April that deportations could proceed only if those about to be removed had a chance to argue their case in court and were given \"a reasonable time\" to contest their pending removals.",
      "\"These men were in imminent danger of spending their lives in a horrific foreign prison without ever having had a chance to go to court,\" ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. \"We are relieved that the Supreme Court has not permitted the administration to whisk them away the way others were just last month.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller on Saturday responded to the Supreme Court's order on X, claiming that the men being held were \"foreign terrorists.\"",
      "\"They were arrested in diligently planned and executed raids recently carried out by Departments of Justice and Homeland Security,\" Miller said.",
      "\"We are confident we will ultimately prevail against the onslaught of meritless litigation brought by radical activists who care more about the rights of these terrorist aliens than those of the American people,\" Leavitt wrote in a separate post.",
      "On Friday, two federal judges refused to step in as lawyers for the men launched a desperate legal campaign to prevent their deportation. Early Saturday, the 5th U.S. Court of Appeals refused to issue an order protecting the detainees from being deported.",
      "The administration is expected to return to the Supreme Court quickly in an effort to persuade the justices to lift their temporary order.",
      "The ACLU had already sued to block deportations of two Venezuelans held in the Bluebonnet facility and sought an order barring removals of any immigrants in the region under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "In an emergency filing early Friday, the ACLU said it heard from lawyers and relatives of some of the men held at the detention center in Ansen, Texas, that immigration authorities were accusing the men of being members of the Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan gang President Trump has made into a focal point of his crackdown on illegal immigration. The organization, citing lawyers and family members, said some of them had been given notices telling them they were slated to be deported under the wartime law.",
      "Citing the March 15 deportations of scores of migrants who were taken to El Salvador's notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, or CECOT, mega-prison, the ACLU implored U.S. District Court Judge James Wesley Hendrix to act quickly.",
      "\"(G)iven the brutal nature of the Salvadoran prison where other Venezuelan men were sent under the (Alien Enemies Act) last month, the irreparable harm to them is manifest,\" the ACLU's emergency motion said.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act in March\u00a0to order officials to immediately detain and remove Venezuelan migrants with alleged ties to Tren de Aragua, arguing that they were invading or staging an incursion into the U.S.",
      "The act has only been invoked three previous times in U.S. history, most recently during World War II to hold Japanese-American civilians in internment camps. The Trump administration contended the AEA gave it the power to swiftly remove immigrants it identified as members of the gang, regardless of their immigration status.",
      "Following the unanimous high court order on April 9, federal judges in\u00a0Colorado,\u00a0New York and southern Texas\u00a0promptly issued orders barring the removal of detainees under the AEA until the administration provides a process for them to make claims in court.",
      "But there had been no such order issued in the area of Texas that covers Bluebonnet, which is located 24 miles north of Abilene in the far northern end of the state.",
      "Judge Hendrix, a Trump appointee, this week declined to bar the administration from removing the two men identified in the ACLU lawsuit because Immigration and Customs Enforcement filed sworn declarations that they would not be immediately deported. He also balked at issuing a broader order prohibiting the removal of all Venezuelans in the area under the act because he said removals hadn't started yet.",
      "But the ACLU's Friday filing included sworn declarations from three separate immigration lawyers who said their clients in Bluebonnet were given paperwork indicating they were members of Tren de Aragua and could be deported by Saturday.",
      "An attorney for the Legal Aid Society said her client refused to sign papers he was given by the detention facility staff because they were in English and he could not understand what they said.",
      "Gelernt said in a Friday evening hearing before District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington, D.C., that the administration initially moved Venezuelans to its south Texas immigration facility for deportation. But since a judge banned deportations in that area, it has funneled them to the Bluebonnet facility, where no such order exists. He said witnesses reported the men were being loaded on buses Friday evening to be taken to the airport.",
      "With Hendrix not agreeing to the ACLU's request for an emergency order, the group turned to Boasberg, who initially halted deportations in March. The Supreme Court ruled the orders against deportation could only come from judges in jurisdictions where immigrants were held, which Boasberg said made him powerless on Friday.",
      "\"I'm sympathetic to everything you're saying,\" Boasberg told Gelernt. \"I just don't think I have the power to do anything about it.\"",
      "Boasberg this week found there's probable cause that the Trump administration committed\u00a0criminal contempt\u00a0by ignoring his order to turn around the planes carrying more than 200 Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. He was concerned that the paper that ICE was giving those held did not make clear they had a right to challenge their removal in court, which he believed the Supreme Court mandated.",
      "Drew Ensign, an attorney for the Justice Department, disagreed, saying that people slated for deportation would have a \"minimum\" of 24 hours to challenge their removal in court. He said no flights were scheduled for Friday night and he was unaware of any Saturday, but the Department of Homeland Security said it reserved the right to remove people then.",
      "ICE said it would not comment on the litigation.",
      "Also Friday, a Massachusetts judge made permanent his temporary ban on the administration deporting immigrants who have exhausted their appeals to countries other than their home countries unless they are informed of their destination and given a chance to object if they'd face torture or death there.",
      "Some Venezuelans subject to Trump's Alien Enemies Act have been sent to El Salvador and housed in its\u00a0notorious\u00a0main prison.",

    "story": [
      "A judge says a former roommate of four University of Idaho students who were killed in 2022 can testify about seeing an intruder with \"bushy eyebrows\" around the time of the crime.",
      "Defense attorneys for Bryan Kohberger had asked 4th District Judge Steven Hippler during a hearing earlier this month to bar any evidence referencing \"bushy eyebrows,\" because they say the roommate's description is unreliable and irrelevant to the case.",
      "But in a ruling released Friday, Hippler said the testimony can be used during Kohberger's trial on four murder charges set to begin later this year.",
      "Kohberger, 30, is charged with murder in the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho.",
      "Kohberger, then a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, was\u00a0arrested in Pennsylvania\u00a0weeks after the deaths. Investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene.",
      "When asked to enter a plea to the charges, Kohberger stood silent, prompting the judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf.",
      "The roommate told police she saw someone wearing black clothing and a ski mask inside the home she shared with four roommates sometime before 4:19 a.m. on the day of the killings, according to court documents.",
      "She was intoxicated at the time, and told police she couldn't remember any other facial characteristics but that the intruder's bushy eyebrows stood out in her memory.",
      "Kohberger's defense attorneys noted that the roommate also constantly questioned what she saw, that her attention was influenced by sleepiness and alcohol, and that her opportunity to see the intruder was seconds at most.",
      "Allowing her to testify about bushy eyebrows when she couldn't provide enough details to allow a police artist to do a composite sketch would be unfair and prejudicial, causing a jury to believe Kohberger is guilty because of his eyebrows, his attorneys said.",
      "But the judge disagreed.",
      "\"There is a large gulf between a finding that a witness is not competent to testify about what they personally witnessed, and simply allowing impeachment by vigorous cross-examination,\" Hippler wrote. \"This is a matter for cross-examination.\"",
      "Hippler also said that if Kohberger is convicted, his defense team can't use his medical diagnoses to explain his \"courtroom demeanor\" unless Kohberger takes the stand during the penalty phase.",
      "Prosecutors had asked the judge to bar any testimony during the penalty phase about Kohberger's autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as the developmental coordination disorder that Kohberger may have experienced in childhood.",
      "The prosecution team said they didn't want mental conditions to be used to try to limit Kohberger's culpability if he is convicted.",
      "But the defense team said they didn't plan on doing that at all, and that instead his autism spectrum diagnosis would be used to explain some of Kohberger's courtroom demeanor, like his tendency to hold eye contact for longer than expected, his ability to sit very still and his stoicism.",
      "The judge said he hadn't noticed any strange behavior.",
      "\"Not once has the Court perceived Defendant to be acting in an odd or incongruent manner or otherwise demonstrating signs at counsel table that would warrant any explanation to the jury. His demeanor has been entirely appropriate,\" Hippler wrote.",
      "Introducing evidence about the autism spectrum diagnosis would likely confuse the jury and take up an undue amount of time in an already long trial, he said.",
      "Still, the judge said, Kohberger's demeanor might become relevant if he takes the stand to testify. Kohberger's OCD diagnosis also might be relevant at some point, Hippler said, particularly since the defense team has said it causes Kohberger to experience sleep difficulties that led to a habit of nighttime driving and running to decompress.",
      "If those scenarios arise during the trial, the judge said the attorneys should bring up the matter to him \u2014 outside the presence of the jury \u2014 so he can make a decision on whether the evidence should be introduced at that time.",

      "A CBS News review found the documents include scans of handwritten notes by convicted assassin Sirhan, witness interviews, crime scene and autopsy photos, FBI memos related to Sirhan and his whereabouts before the shooting, correspondence to the government from the American public in reaction to the assassination, and interviews with Sirhan's family.",
      "Many of the details shared in the files were already known.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the release, which began Friday, comes after an effort done in conjunction with the National Archives and other agency officials to scan and upload more than 10,000 pages, which will be available for the American people to view online \"to fulfill President Trump's maximum transparency promise.\"",
      "The records will be published with limited redactions for privacy reasons, such as to shield Social Security numbers, she said.",
      "Gabbard said that an additional 50,000 pages of files related to Robert F. Kennedy's killing were discovered during searches of CIA and FBI warehouses for documents that had not been turned over to the Archives. Agencies are working to make those documents available and will continue searching government facilities for more, according to the director of national intelligence.",
      "What did the RFK files say?",
      "The documents released so far appear to include Justice Department and FBI memos, as well as photos of evidence collected during the investigation into Robert F. Kennedy's assassination and clippings from news reports. Some scanned records are difficult to read, as are handwritten notes included in the tranche.",
      "Some of Sirhan's apparent notes viewed by CBS News include messages like \"RFK must be disposed of like his brother was\" and \"My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more [and] more of an unshakeable obsession.\" Other notes from Sirhan expressing hatred for Robert F. Kennedy have been publicly known for decades and were referenced at his trial.",
      "Also in the files: A 1968 FBI memo that offered an assessment of Sirhan, including that he fell from a horse and sustained a head injury in 1966, and family members said his behavior changed markedly afterward.",
      "A June 12 FBI memo describes Robert F. Kennedy's widow Ethel Kennedy's \"distraught\" reactions to the shooting, with one ambulance worker recounting she told him, \"keep your hands off him,\" and another witness saying she knocked over a TV news camera and hit a reporter in the chest at the hospital.",
      "Some of the documents detail eyewitness interviews about both Sirhan and the shooting. A few of those records touch on longstanding conspiracy theories about the assassination. There are references to witnesses seeing a woman in a polka-dot dress or somebody shouting \"we shot him,\" which often features in theories about the shooting, though other witnesses say they didn't spot anybody matching that description.",
      "What could the new RFK files reveal?",
      "It's unclear what new information on the 1968 slaying could emerge from the disclosures, several experts told CBS News before the documents were released. Robert F. Kennedy's killing was primarily investigated and prosecuted by local officials in Los Angeles, and files from that investigation \u2014 along with many records from a parallel FBI probe \u2014 have been publicly available in California's state archives for decades with few omissions. It's not clear if other federal agencies hold records tied to the assassination.",
      "The administration has also vowed to release files on Rev. Martin Luther King's 1968 assassination, and it published troves of declassified files on President John F. Kennedy's 1963 killing in March.",
      "Why did Trump release RFK files \u2014 and is RFK Jr. involved?",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to unseal records on King, John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy in late January. In an April 10 cabinet meeting, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said the King and Robert F. Kennedy files would be ready within days, including what she described as decades-old documents that \"have never been scanned or seen before.\"",
      "\"Nearly 60 years after the tragic assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, the American people will, for the first time, have the opportunity to review the federal government's investigation thanks to the leadership of President Trump,\" Gabbard said in a statement. \"My team is honored that the President entrusted us to lead the declassification efforts and to shine a long-overdue light on the truth. I extend my deepest thanks for Bobby Kennedy and his families' support.\"",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he's \"very grateful\" for the release.",
      "The health secretary \u2014 who was 14 years old when his father was assassinated \u2014 has shown an interest in the case for years, doubting the conclusion that Sirhan was responsible for his father's killing. Breaking with many of his siblings, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. backed Sirhan's 2021 request for parole after meeting with Sirhan in prison.",
      "Who killed RFK?",
      "Sirhan was arrested shortly after the 1968 assassination, which took place at the Ambassador Hotel while Robert F. Kennedy was running for president, and convicted of murder. He has admitted to killing the senator and linked it to Robert F. Kennedy's backing of Israel, though at other points, he has denied responsibility or said he couldn't remember the incident.",
      "Sirhan's requests for parole have been repeatedly rejected. California's parole board backed his 2021 bid for early release, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom overrode their decision.",
      "Still, the case has drawn waves of public attention, as some critics \u2014 including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 claim Sirhan didn't fire the fatal shots or other parties were involved in the killing. Skeptics typically cite issues with eyewitness testimony or the alleged presence of extra bullets at the crime scene \u2014 though other researchers have backed the view that Sirhan acted alone.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 19:34:39 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump administration economist Kevin Hassett said Powell's removal is being studied by the president and his team.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump and his team are studying whether firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is an option, according to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett.",
      "Though appointed by the president and approved by Congress, the Federal Reserve chair is an independent\u00a0role. Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017 and was renominated to serve another 4-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "\"The President and his team will continue to study that matter,\" Hassett said when asked during a press gaggle on Friday if removing Powell from his post was likely.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday took aim at Powell\u00a0in a social media post, writing that the Fed should be cutting interest rates, and adding that his \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",
      "In a speech delivered on Wednesday, Powell\u00a0warned\u00a0that the Trump administration's trade war could result in a combination of higher inflation and slower growth. That economic mix describes stagflation \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that characterizes periods when economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate.",
      "On Wednesday, Powell also reiterated that the central bank plans to hold interest rates steady for now, also sparking pushback from Mr. Trump.",
      "\"He's too late. Always too late. A little slow and I'm not happy with him. I let him know it and \u2014 if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday at the White House.",
      "Can Mr. Trump fire Powell?",
      "A landmark ruling by the Supreme Court in 1935 affirmed Congress' authority to create independent federal agencies whose board members could only be forced out before their terms expired \"for cause.\"",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said he\u00a0wouldn't step down\u00a0if asked by the president, who has previously criticized his performance. Powell has also noted that presidents may not legally fire or demote the Fed chair.",
      "But Mr. Trump this week fired two Democrats on the board of another financial regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, reported Reuters on Wednesday. And in March, the White House dismissed two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission, which historically has operated as an independent, bipartisan commission.",
      "Even if Mr. Trump were able to remove Powell, it's not clear that doing so would change the direction of the central bank's decisions on interest rates. Those calls are made by the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC \u2014 a 12-member group tasked with setting monetary policy \u2014 and not at Powell's discretion.",
      "Who would replace Powell?",
      "Fed governor Kevin Warsh, 55, is a former Morgan Stanley executive who was nominated to the Fed's board of governors by President George W. Bush.",
      "Mr. Trump is considering selecting Warsh as Powell's replacement, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported\u00a0on Thursday. However, Warsh has advised Mr. Trump to allow Powell to remain through the end of his term, the publication added.",
      "Widely respected, Warsh is considered to be even more hawkish \u2014 or willing to allow interest rates to remain high to control inflation \u2014 than Powell, according to a January blog post\u00a0by Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff.",

      "FSU student Blake Leonard told CBS News Miami he heard a total of about 30 shots fired. Leonard said he was about 400 feet from the student union when he heard gunfire and started running.",
      "\"I heard about 12 shots go off. In my head I thought it was construction at first, until I looked behind me and saw people running from the union towards my direction, and then I heard another 12 or 15 shots go off, so I started running away from there too,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Some employees working on the CDC's measles response were warned they could face layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scrapped a plan to offer help curbing measles in Texas schools after some staff working on the agency's response to this year's record outbreak of the virus were warned they could face layoffs, an agency employee said.",
      "CDC officials had initially weighed expanding a service they had been offering to hospitals in Texas \u2014 onsite assessments to root out how errors in ventilation and air filtration could be enabling spread of the virus \u2013 to other kinds of facilities like schools as well.",
      "\"Being on the ground allows us to actually look at the filters that are in place, look at the HVAC systems, how they're set up, how they're being used, how they're being monitored. And after seeing what we did, I'm glad we did,\" Dylan Neu, who had led the CDC's ventilation assessments in Texas, told CBS News.",
      "Neu is a biomedical engineer for the CDC's National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, or NIOSH, which was largely eliminated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s first wave of layoffs earlier this month.",
      "He spoke with CBS News as a member of the labor union American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, which represents NIOSH employees in Ohio that were impacted by Kennedy's layoffs.",
      "Two experts from NIOSH \u2014 Neu and an industrial hygienist \u2014 were first sent to Texas on March 20 at the state's request. They found a number of issues at hospitals in Texas that had been actively treating measles patients during the outbreak, Neu said.",
      "The agency's teams do careful inspections of the hospital's facilities, assessing how air is moving, he said, which can be difficult to accurately do over the phone with people unfamiliar with the technical details of how HVAC systems work.",
      "In one example, an isolation room at a hospital was found to have been pressurized wrongly, with air flowing out of the room with the measles patient, Neu said. Another hospital had skipped a key step in setting up an air filter in their waiting room: unwrapping the filter before turning it on.",
      "\"They might say in an interview, 'Yeah, we purchased HEPA filters. They've been running in the waiting room.' But if they're not actually out of the plastic bag, they're not doing what they think they're doing,\" Neu said.",
      "While Neu remains on the job for now, he received a notice on April 1 warning him to expect to be laid off by HHS in the coming weeks.",
      "\"This action is necessary to align our workforce with the agency's current and future needs and to ensure the efficient and effective operation of our programs,\" Neu's notice from the department said.",
      "Neu said he received the notice while in his hotel room in Texas, as he prepared to return from his deployment. Most of his colleagues and the leadership above him within NIOSH have either been laid off, offered reassignments to other agencies or warned to expect cuts.",
      "\"My current understanding is that I'll be working in the office until the end of this month, and then I'll be on 60 days administrative leave until June 30th, and then we'll be separated at that point,\" he said.",
      "Agency officials scrapped plans to offer future ventilation assessments to Texas, he said, because of the prospect that he might get laid off while in the field and cut off from the agency's systems.",
      "A CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "While much of the work Neu's team does at NIOSH is research, he said that experts on his team have often been tapped to deploy to emergency responses as the agency's primary experts on topics like ventilation and contamination.",
      "He recounted several past deployments, ranging from helping hospitals around the country draw up plans to prepare for Ebola cases during the Obama administration, to helping the agency's quarantine station at Detroit's airport build an isolation room to screen passengers early during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We're involved in pretty much every response the CDC is involved in. Especially if there's some sort of engineering or ventilation component, NIOSH gets called in as that scientific expertise,\" he said.",
      "The layoffs have also upended other work done by NIOSH to respond to requests like health hazard evaluations, where workplaces can call on the agency for help investigating health issues on the job, like cancer clusters\u00a0or fungal outbreaks.",
      "Impact on the CDC's measles response also goes beyond NIOSH. CBS News previously reported that multiple agency staff assigned to the effort had been let go.",

      "Students who knew him are also beginning to share more information about his background.",
      "Years-long custody battles",
      "CBS News obtained court records showing a years-long custody battle between the birth parents of suspect Phoenix Ikner, who was shot by police and taken to a hospital following Thursday's mass shooting.",
      "The custody disputes between birth parents Anne-Mari Eriksen and Christopher Ikner began in 2007 and lasted through 2023. Public\u00a0records\u00a0show Christopher Ikner married Jessica Ikner, the suspect's stepmother, in 2010. Two former schoolmates of the suspect told CBS News he used to go by Christian Eriksen.",
      "Records show Anne-Mari Erikson filed a lawsuit in 2015 against Christopher Ikner, Jessica Ikner, and other family members, alleging slander and libel, according to court records. The case was dismissed in 2016.",
      "In 2016, Anne-Mari Eriksen was found guilty of removing her child from the state and failing to return him, according to court records. The incident occurred in 2015, when Anne-Mari Eriksen told Christopher Ikner that she was taking their then 10-year-old son to South Florida for spring break. Instead, she left the country with him and traveled to Norway, a violation of their custody agreement.",
      "At the time, Christopher Ikner told authorities their son had \"developmental delays\" and \"special needs,\" and was taking medication for \"severe health and mental issues,\" including ADHD and a growth hormone disorder. He said Anne-Mari Eriksen did not respond to his questions about their return from Norway in repeated emails and phone calls over several weeks, and told police that he believed she \"had no intention of returning\" to Florida.",
      "Christopher Ikner filed a child custody order violation against Anne-Mari Eriksen, according to a probable cause affidavit from the Leon County Sheriff's Office. Erikson pleaded no contest to charges of removing the child from the state and failing to remove him. Court records show she received a jail sentence and was ordered to have no contact with her son, his father, and his wife, except as allowed via family court.",
      "Months after the spring break incident, Anne-Mari Eriksen filed a civil lawsuit against Christopher Ikner, Jessica Ikner, and his parents, alleging defamation of character and emotional harm.",
      "\"The emotional and psychological harm done to the minor child will be evident for years, and will require counseling, and given the child being the age of 11, will have memory impacted by the behaviors of all the defendants for the false claims done on his mother, and for the parental alienation of the close relationship of the minor child,\" she alleged in the complaint.",
      "In 2016, a Leon County judge dismissed the complaint.",
      "Suspect obtained weapon from stepmom",
      "Authorities told reporters the weapon used in Thursday's shooting was a former service weapon belonging to the suspect's stepmother, Jessica Ikner, a Leon County Sheriff's deputy, which she now owned as a personal handgun.",
      "Leon County Sheriff Walter McNeil told reporters that Jessica Ikner has worked at the sheriff's office for 18 years. She worked as a school resource deputy, according to the LCSO\u00a0website.",
      "She was seen in a social media post smiling and receiving an award from McNeil.",
      "Students describe interactions with suspect",
      "Florida State University student Reid Seybold, who knew the mass shooting suspect from a political club at a former college, told CBS News that the alleged gunman was asked to leave the group after espousing white supremacist rhetoric that \"made enough people uncomfortable.\" CBS News has not independently verified these claims. Seybold said the suspect seemed \"fairly normal\" when he saw him around campus afterward and said he won't speculate on the motive behind Thursday's deadly shooting.",
      "Jennifer Jaskolski, 20, was in the same grade as the suspect at Swift Creek Middle School and Lincoln High School. She told CBS News the two of them rode the school bus together in 6th and 7th grade, before he switched to a special education transportation option in 8th grade.",
      "He was in a combination of regular and special education classes, according to Jaskolski.",
      "Jaskolski remembers Jessica Ikner picking him up from school while wearing her sheriff's deputy uniform.",
      "Jaskolski's friend, Gemma Garcia, attended middle school with the suspect.",
      "Garcia, 19, was in the grade below the suspect at Swift Creek Middle School and shared a yearbook photo of him from 2018 in which the name under his photo reads \"Christian Eriksen.\"",
      "Garcia told CBS News she is starting at FSU next semester and saw the emergency response scene near campus Thursday.",

    "summary": "The temporary truce began at 6 p.m. local time Saturday and was to run through midnight on Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a temporary \"Easter truce\" in the three-year conflict in Ukraine that will last until midnight Sunday.",
      "\"On humanitarian grounds, today from 6 p.m. to midnight from Sunday to Monday, the Russian side announces an Easter truce,\" Putin said in a televised statement released by the Kremlin. The statement has been translated. \"For this period, I order to stop all fighting. We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops should be prepared to reflect possible violations of the truce and provocations by the enemy, any aggressive actions.\"",
      "Putin first announced the ceasefire in a meeting with Chief of the General Staff Velary Gerasimov, the Kremlin Press Service said.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said in a translated statement that the ceasefire is imposed \"for humanitarian purposes and will be observed by the Russian Unified Group of Troops (forces) provided that it is mutually respected by the Kiev regime.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said if Russia is genuinely ready to observe a full and unconditional ceasefire, Ukraine will mirror that approach and strike only in defense.",
      "He said such a gesture, particularly over the Easter weekend, could reveal Moscow's true intentions.",
      "\"If a full ceasefire truly takes hold, Ukraine proposes extending it beyond Easter Day on April 20,\" Zelenskyy said on Telegram. \"That will reveal Russia's true intentions, as 30 hours are enough for headlines, but not for genuine confidence-building measures.\"",
      "Zelenskyy added that, according to military reports, Russian assaults and artillery fire continued along parts of the 600-mile-long front line.",
      "In response to the ceasefire announcement, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Kyiv had in March \"agreed unconditionally to the U.S. proposal of a full interim ceasefire for 30 days,\" which Russia rejected.",
      "\"Putin has now made statements about his alleged readiness for a ceasefire. 30 hours instead of 30 days,\" Sybiha continued, writing on X. \"Unfortunately, we have had a long history of his statements not matching his actions.\"",
      "Previous attempts at holding ceasefires for Easter in April 2022 and Orthodox Christmas in January 2023 were not implemented after both sides failed to agree on them. Ukraine last month agreed to President Trump's proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire, only for Putin to reject it.",
      "Russia and Ukraine conduct prisoner exchange",
      "Also Saturday, Russia and Ukraine conducted a prisoner swap that was mediated by the United Arab Emirates, Russian state news agency TASS reported.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense said 246 Russian service members were returned from territory controlled by Kyiv, and that as a \"gesture of goodwill,\" 31 wounded Ukrainian prisoners of war were transferred in exchange for 15 wounded Russian soldiers in need of urgent medical care.",
      "Zelenskyy said 277 Ukrainian \"warriors have returned home from Russian captivity.\" He thanked the United Arab Emirates for mediating the exchange.",
      "It was the largest exchange since Russia invaded Ukraine over three years ago.",
      "Announcement follows frustration from Trump administration",
      "The announcement came the day after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Trump's administration was ready to \"move on\" from peace talks between Russia and Ukraine if progress was not made in the coming days. Rubio made the comments in Paris, after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials.",
      "\"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters while departing Paris. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"",
      "\"It's not our war,\" Rubio added. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\" Another meeting is expected next week in London.",
      "Later Friday, Mr. Trump echoed Rubio's frustrations with the pace of the talks. When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between the U.S. and Russia, though he said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Putin were scheduled for the coming days.",
      "Fighting before ceasefire",
      "Earlier Saturday, Russia's Defense Ministry said its forces pushed Ukrainian forces from one of their last remaining footholds in Russia's Kursk region. Russian forces took control of the village of Oleshnya, on the border with Ukraine, the ministry said. Gerasimov said Russian troops had retaken 99% of the territory seized by Ukraine.",
      "\"In the areas of the Kursk region where Ukraine armed force mounted an incursion, the main part of the territory... is now liberated. That's 1,260 square kilometres, 99.5 percent,\" Gerasimov told Putin.",
      "The Associated Press was unable to immediately verify the claim. In the same statement where he reacted to the ceasefire, Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces \"continued their activity\" and are \"maintaining their positions\" in the Kursk region. He also said that military forces \"advanced and increased our zone of control\" in Belgorod, a Russian city about 24 miles from the Russia-Ukraine border.",
      "According to TASS, Russia is still fighting to push Ukrainian forces out of the village of Gornal, some 7 miles south of Oleshnya.",
      "\"The Russian military has yet to push the Ukrainian armed forces out of Gornal ... in order to completely liberate the Kursk region. Fierce fighting is underway in the settlement,\" the agency reported, citing Russian security agencies.",
      "In other developments, the Ukrainian air force reported that Russia fired 87 exploding drones and decoys in the latest wave of attacks overnight into Saturday. It said 33 of them were intercepted and another 36 were lost, likely having been electronically jammed.",
      "Russian attacks damaged farms in the Odesa region and sparked fires in the Sumy region overnight, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said Saturday. Fires were contained, and no casualties were reported.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense, meanwhile, said its air defense systems shot down two Ukrainian drones overnight into Saturday.",

    "story": [
      "Don Pettit, NASA's oldest active-duty astronaut, celebrated his 70th birthday with two cosmonaut crewmates overnight Saturday, undocking from the International Space Station and plunging back to Earth in a blaze of re-entry heat to close out a 220-day expedition.",
      "Pettit, Soyuz MS-26/72S commander Alexey Ovchinin and flight engineer Ivan Vagner undocked from the Russian Rassvet module at 5:57 p.m. EDT, setting up a parachute-assisted landing on the steppe of Kazakhstan near the town of Dzhezkazgan at 9:20 p.m. EDT \u2014 6:20 a.m. local time Sunday, Pettit's birthday, at the landing site.",
      "Russian recovery crews and NASA personnel rushed to the spacecraft, opened the top hatch and helped carry the returning crew members to nearby recliners where flight surgeons carried out initial health checks.",
      "Ovchinin and Vagner appeared to be in good spirits, smiling, chatting with support crews and enjoying drinks and snacks. Pettit, however, looked disoriented as he was carried from the descent module, letting his head fall back and closing his eyes as he was moved to his recliner. He was not seen again on the landing site video.",
      "But there were no indications of any sort of major problem, medical or otherwise. From Kazakhstan, Ovchinin and Vagner will head back to Star City near Moscow, while Pettit will be flown to Houston and the Johnson Space Center for more detailed tests and the start of physical re-habilitation.",
      "In an April 16 interview with KOIN-TV in Portland, Oregon, Pettit said he had more difficulty than most when returning to gravity after a long stay in space.",
      "\"The very first thing I'm going to do when I get to Earth will probably be to empty the contents of my stomach,\" he said, prompting laughter. \"It's a physiological thing, it affects different people different ways. Some people can land and go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I'm a human being again.\"",
      "With the on-time landing, mission duration stood at 220 days and nearly nine hours, spanning 3,520 orbits and 93.3 million miles since launch last Sept. 11 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",
      "Ovchinin has now logged 595 days in space over four flights, followed closely by Pettit, whose total stands at 590 days over four flights of his own. Vagner's total after two station visits stands at 416 days.",
      "The world record for most cumulative time in space is held by cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko, who spent nearly 1,111 days in orbit over five missions. The U.S. record is held by astronaut Peggy Whitson. She spent 675 days in space over four flights.",
      "As for Pettit's age, John Glenn, the first American in orbit, was 77 when he flew aboard the space shuttle in 1998 as a NASA spaceflight participant. He holds the record as the oldest person to fly in orbit.",
      "The Soyuz crew's return to Earth marked the final chapter in an extended crew rotation that began with launch of SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov on March 14.",
      "Crew 10's arrival at the station cleared the way for Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and pilot Sunita Williams to return to Earth four days later.",
      "The Russians then launched replacements for Pettit's crew\u00a0\u2014 Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim \u2014 on April 8, clearing the way for Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit to return to Earth Saturday.",
      "In a brief ceremony Friday, Ovchinin turned command of the station over to Onishi.",
      "\"It's a great honor for me to accept the command of the ISS,\" Onishi said. \"I feel so special that I am taking over the command from you because it's been almost nine years since we met here in 2016 during Expedition 48. At that time, both of us were rookies and here we are two veterans who are ISS commanders.\"",
      "\"Human space flight is not easy. Only continuous dedication from generation to generation made it possible for human beings to get here. Now today, we have four rookies (on board). I'm sure one day they will come back and become commanders ... that's how we will continue to develop human space flight,\" Onishi said.",
      "The ISS has been continuously staffed by rotating crews since Nov. 2, 2000. Scheduled for retirement in five years, the lab is facing problems on multiple fronts, ranging from air leaks in the Russian segment to uncertain funding, spare parts shortages and resupply delays.",
      "\"Spaceflight is difficult and very risky,\" Rich Williams, a member of NASA's independent Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, told the group in a public meeting Thursday. \"The ISS has entered the riskiest period of its existence.\"",
      "\"The ISS management, crew and support personnel always make spaceflight look easy. Spaceflight is anything but easy, and the increasing risks attending the ISS program are making it harder,\" Williams said.",
      "The air leaks in the Zvezda module's aft docking compartment are presumably the results of metal fatigue and repeated pressure cycles as visiting Soyuz crew ships and Progress cargo freighters come and go.",
      "\"Primary risk mitigation activities at this point include application and patching materials to known cracks and limiting ... pressurization cycles to try to limit stress and fatigue,\" Williams said. \"The ISS program is monitoring this closely, and the panel considers this one of our highest concerns.\"",
      "NASA has hired SpaceX to build a U.S. deorbit vehicle, or USDV, to drive the million-pound space station back into the atmosphere in 2030 to ensure it breaks up over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from shipping lanes and populated areas. The USDV is expected to arrive at the lab in 2029.",
      "\"Delivering and utilizing this USDV capability is critical to ensuring that the deorbit debris risk meets the established government public safety standards,\" Williams said. \"If there is a deorbit of the ISS before the USDV is delivered, the risk to the public from ISS breakup debris will increase by orders of magnitude.\"",
      "He said NASA and Russian space officials are working \"to address the challenges associated with achieving a safe deorbit capability, both for end-of-life as well as a risk-managed deorbit for contingencies.\"",
      "The major problem facing the ISS is what Williams called \"a large ISS budget shortfall.\" NASA's fiscal 2024 budget included nearly $1 billion for station operations and maintenance with another $1.6 billion earmarked for crew launches and resupply missions.",
      "\"It is critical to maintain adequate budget and resources until the vehicle has safely re-entered, not only to assure safety of day-to-day operations in a high-risk environment, but also to ensure controlled, safe deorbit within debris footprint requirements for the sake of public safety,\" Williams said.",
      "In summary, he said, \"the panel appreciates the demonstrated operational excellence of the ISS program, but remains deeply concerned about the increasing and cascading risks attending the program over the next several years.\"",

      "After the meeting, Araghchi said the two countries agreed to have another round of negotiations in Oman on April 26. But experts will meet there in the days before.",
      "\"The talks were held in a constructive environment and I can say that is moving forward,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television. \"I hope that we will be in a better position after the technical talks.\"",

Mr. Trump, in his first term, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018, setting off years of attacks and negotiations that failed to restore the accord that drastically limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran's nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue an atomic weapon.",

      "Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador on Wednesday, April 16, to check on Abrego Garcia's health and well-being, a month after he was deported to a Salvadoran supermax prison known as CECOT.",
      "\"His conversation with me was the first communication that he had with anybody outside of prison since he was abducted. He said he felt very sad about being in a prison because he had not committed any crimes,\" Van Hollen said.",
      "However, he said, Abrego Garcia has since been moved to another prison where he says the conditions are better.",
      "\"He told me, and this was yesterday, eight days ago, so nine days ago from today, he was moved to another detention center in Santa Ana, where the conditions are better. But he said, despite the better conditions, he still has no access to any news from the outside world and no ability to communicate with anybody in the outside world,\" Van Hollen said.",
      "Abrego Garcia was \"traumatized\" at CECOT, Van Hollen says",
      "Van Hollen said he asked Abrego Garcia how he was dealing with his circumstances.",
      "\"He said that thinking of you, members of his family, is what gave him history to persevere, to keep going day to day, even under these awful circumstances,\" Van Hollen recounted.",
      "During their conversation, Abrego Garcia described his experience in CECOT.",
      "Abrego Garcia said that after he was detained by ICE officials, he was taken to a Baltimore detention center, where he was denied a phone call. He was then moved again to another facility in Texas before being put on a plane to El Salvador.",
      "\"I don't know whether it was period hours or days, he was handcuffed, shackled, and put on a plane, along with some others, where they couldn't see out of the windows. There was no way to see where they were going in the plane, they didn't know for sure where they were going. They landed in El Salvador,\" Van Hollen said.",
      "After arriving at the prison, Abrego Garcia was placed in a cell with about 25 other prisoners.",
      "\"The government in this case, the Trump administration, is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without a semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \u00a0\"He was traumatized by being at CECOT and fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways, he told me.\"",
      "Van Hollen faced challenges trying to meet with Abrego Garcia",
      "During his trip, Van Hollen initially faced challenges when trying to coordinate a meeting with Abrego Garcia.",

      "\"I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love,\"\u00a0Van Hollen said in a social media post.",
      "The president of El Salvador\u00a0Nayib Bukele shared photos of the meeting\u00a0as well, saying Abrego Garcia, \"gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.\"",

      "He was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in March as he was leaving his job in Baltimore.",
      "He and about 200 other migrants were transported to CECOT in El Salvador by plane at the direction of the Trump administration.",
      "His deportation sparked a legal battle as he was under a protection order granted by an immigration judge in 2019. The \"withholding of removal\" order should have prevented him from being deported to El Salvador.",
      "ICE officials admitted in a court filing that Abrego Garcia's deportation occurred because of an administrative error, though they did not move to correct the mistake.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-ukraine-war-russia-rubio-says-us-may-move-on-peace-efforts-not-our-war/",
    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 20:01:25 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump could give up on efforts to end the war in Ukraine \"in a matter of days,\" Rubio says, highlighting the administration view that it's \"not our war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Friday that the U.S. may \"move on\" from trying to secure a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if there is no progress in the coming days. Months of efforts by the White House have failed to bring an end to the fighting, despite repeated promises by President Trump before he took office that he would use his skills as a negotiator to end the war immediately.",
      "Rubio spoke in Paris after landmark talks among U.S., Ukrainian and European officials produced outlines for steps toward peace and appeared to make some long-awaited progress. A new meeting is expected next week in London, and Rubio suggested that could be decisive in determining whether the Trump administration continues its involvement.",
      "\"We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,\" Rubio told reporters upon departure. \"Because if it's not, then I think we're just going to move on.\"",
      "\"It's not our war,\" Rubio said. \"We have other priorities to focus on.\" He said the U.S. administration wants to decide \"in a matter of days.\"",
      "His remarks contrasted starkly with the stance of the Biden administration, during which then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned not long after the war began that Russia's autocratic President Vladimir Putin was determined \"to reconstitute the Soviet empire. Short of that, he'd like to reassert a sphere of influence around neighboring countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc. And short of that, he'd like to make sure that all of these countries are somehow neutral.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has also warned, including in multiple interviews with CBS News, that Putin is intent on expanding Russia's borders by force \u2014 and breaking the security bonds forged among Western democracies during World War II, of which the U.S.-led NATO alliance has been the most tangible.",
      "\"For him, we are a satellite of Russian Federation. At the moment, it's us, then Kazakhstan, then Baltic states, then Poland, then Germany. At least half of Germany,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News' Charlie D'Agata about one year ago. \"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members.\"",
      "Zelenskyy called Russia's invasion a war \"against the democracy, against the values, against the whole world,\" acknowledging even then that some in the West might be tired of hearing that message, \"but only those are tired who are not at war, who don't know what war is, and who have never lost his or her children.\"",
      "\"If we do not stand firm, he will advance further,\" Zelenskyy reiterated in an interview with 60 Minutes just this month. \"It is not just idle speculation; the threat is real. Putin's ultimate goal is to revive the Russian empire and reclaim territories currently under NATO protection. Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war.\"",
      "Trump says \"we have a minerals deal\" with Ukraine",
      "Rubio's comments on Friday came hours after the U.S. and Ukraine seemingly neared a long-delayed deal to grant U.S. access to Ukraine's vast mineral resources, which has been intertwined with President Trump's peace push.",
      "\"We have a minerals deal,'' Mr. Trump said Thursday, and Ukraine's economy minister said Friday that the two countries had signed a memorandum of intent ahead of a possible fuller agreement later.",
      "The deal, which Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said she signed with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is expected to pave the way for significant investments, infrastructure modernization and long-term cooperation.",
      "Work toward the mineral deal had stalled in February following a contentious Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Negotiations have since resumed.",
      "Rubio on the dialogue with Russia, and Europe",
      "Despite apparent growing U.S. impatience with the peace efforts, Rubio called Thursday's Paris talks constructive. \"Nobody rejected anything, nobody got up from the table or walked away.\"",
      "Rubio didn't single out Russia or Ukraine as blocking peace efforts. He said he informed Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov about the outlines that emerged when they spoke after the Paris talks, but wouldn't say how Lavrov reacted.",
      "When asked about Rubio's comments on Friday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that \"fairly complex\" negotiations were ongoing between Russia and the U.S. He did not give details but said no direct talks between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin were scheduled in the coming days.",
      "\"Russia is striving toward resolving this conflict, securing its own interests, and is open to dialogue. We are continuing to do this,\" he said.",
      "In its readout on the call with Rubio, the Kremlin said Lavrov had confirmed Moscow's \"readiness to continue working together with American colleagues to reliably eliminate the root causes of the Ukrainian crisis.\"",
      "Putin and his deputies have consistently claimed those root causes are Zelenskyy's actions and NATO's eastward expansion \u2014 misleading narratives that Mr. Trump himself has at times espoused about the full-scale invasion Putin launched on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "After weeks of tension with European allies, Rubio told reporters in Paris that the European negotiators proved helpful. \"The U.K. and France and Germany can help us move the ball on this.\"",
      "During a meeting on Friday with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome, Vice President JD Vance also spoke about the ongoing negotiations with Ukraine and Russia, saying he wouldn't \"pre-judge them, but we feel optimistic that we can hopefully bring this war, this very brutal war to a close.\"",
      "European concerns are growing, however, about Mr. Trump's readiness to draw closer to Russia. These talks were the first time since his inauguration that top American, Ukrainian and European officials met to discuss an end to the war, which has posed the biggest security challenge to Europe since World War II.",
      "The meetings addressed hypothetical security guarantees for Ukraine in the future, but Rubio wouldn't discuss any possible U.S. role in that. Some kind of U.S. support for Ukraine is seen as crucial to ensuring that Russia would not attack again if and when a peace deal is reached.",
      "Rubio and presidential envoy Steve Witkoff have helped lead U.S. efforts to seek peace, and Witkoff has met three times with Putin, Rubio said. Several rounds of negotiations have been held in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Moscow has effectively refused to accept a comprehensive ceasefire that Mr. Trump has pushed and Ukraine has endorsed. Russia has made it conditional on a halt in Ukraine's mobilization efforts and Western arms supplies, which are demands rejected by Ukraine.",
      "Deadly Russian strikes on Ukraine continue",
      "Russia, meanwhile, has kept up a series of deadly strikes on Ukrainian cities, according to officials there, wounding scores of civilians days after missiles killed at least 34 during Palm Sunday celebrations in the northern city of Sumy.",
      "One person died and 103 others, including eight children, were wounded as Russia hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, early on Friday, its mayor Ihor Terekhov reported. He said cluster munitions struck a \"densely populated\" neighborhood four times.",
      "Russian drones also targeted a bakery in Sumy, less than a week after the deadly Palm Sunday strike there, killing a customer and wounding an employee, the regional prosecutor's office said. Photos released by the agency showed rows of Easter cakes stacked inside a devastated building, covered in thick dust, as a huge hole gaped in the wall behind them and rubble piled up on the floor.",
      "Last Sunday's strike on Sumy, resulting in mass casualties, was the second large-scale missile attack to claim civilian lives in just over a week. Some 20 people, including nine children, died on April 4 as missiles struck Zelenskyy's hometown of Kryvyi Rih.",

Thornton, 34, landed on Omaha Beach in Normandy with Company H, 2nd Battalion, 116th Infantry Regimental Combat Team, 29th Infantry Division as part of the second wave of the invasion, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. D-Day, or Operation Overlord, was a massive Allied invasion of northern France by air and sea during World War II. The operation, on June 6, 1944, marked the beginning of the liberation of Europe from Hitler's rule.",
      "The company disembarked from their landing craft at around 7 a.m. Fellow soldiers observed Thornton wading ashore, but he was not seen again after that, the DPAA said. The day after the invasion, Thornton's unit searched for him, but he was not found. He was officially listed as missing in action. His name was engraved on the Walls of the Missing at the Normandy American Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France.",
      "On June 8, 1944, two days after D-Day, graves registration personnel recovered a set of remains from Omaha Beach that they were unable to identify, the DPAA said. The remains were interred at U.S. Military Cemetery Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer, near Omaha Beach, and marked as X-159 St. Laurent.",

    "story": [
      "Milan\u00a0- A cable car carrying tourists south of Naples crashed to the ground Thursday after a cable snapped, killing at least four people and critically injuring one, officials said.",
      "The snapped cable brought both the upward and downward-going cable cars to a halt as they traversed Monte Faito in the town of Castellammare di Stabia. The upward cable car eventually crashed, causing the fatalities and injury, while eight tourists and an operator were evacuated from the downward cable car, Naples Prefect Michele de Bari said.",
      "Three tourists were among four people who died, including a British and an Israeli woman, according to Marco De Rosa, the spokesperson for the mayor of the local town of Vico Equense. Only two of the three foreign victims had been identified by the morning after the accident.",
      "Italian prosecutors have opened an investigation into multiple manslaughter and culpable disaster.",
      "\"The traction cable broke. The emergency brake downstream worked, but evidently not the one on the cabin that was entering the station,'' said Castellammare Mayor Luigi Vicinanza.",
      "Italy's alpine rescue, along with firefighters, police and civil protection services responded to the accident.",
      "The accident occurred just a week after the cable car, popular for its views of Mount Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples, reopened for the season.",
      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni expressed her condolences for the victims and their families and said she was in touch with rescuers. She was in Washington, where she met with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Fourteen people were killed in a similar accident in 2021 when a cable broke in northern Italy's picturesque lake region, sending a cable car plummeting to the ground and then tumbling down a slope.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-strikes-yemens-houthi-rebels-oil-port/",
    "published": "Fri, 18 Apr 2025 06:02:21 -0400",
    "summary": "U.S. airstrikes targeting an oil port held by Yemen's Houthi rebels killed dozens and wounded more than 100 others, the group says.",
    "story": [
      "Dubai, United Arab Emirates \u2014 U.S. airstrikes targeting the Ras Isa oil port held by Yemen's Houthi rebels killed 58 people and wounded 126 others, the group said Friday, marking what appeared to be the single-deadliest known attack under President Trump's new campaign targeting the rebels.",
      "Assessing the toll of Mr. Trump's campaign, which began March 15, has been incredibly difficult as the U.S. military's Central Command so far hasn't released any information on the campaign, its specific targets and how many people have been killed. Meanwhile, Yemen's Houthi rebels strictly control access to areas attacked and don't publish information on the strikes, many of which likely have targeted military and security sites.",
      "But the strike on the Ras Isa oil port, which sent massive fireballs shooting into the night sky, represented a major escalation of the American campaign. The Houthis also immediately released graphic footage of those killed in the attack.",
      "The war in Yemen, meanwhile, was further internationalized as the U.S. alleged a Chinese satellite company was \"directly supporting\" Houthi attacks, something Beijing didn't immediately acknowledge.",
      "The Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel aired graphic footage of the aftermath of the attack on Ras Isa port, showing corpses strewn across the site. It said paramedic and civilians workers at the port had been killed in the attack, which sparked a massive explosion and fires.",
      "In a statement, Central Command said \"U.S. forces took action to eliminate this source of fuel for the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists and deprive them of illegal revenue that has funded Houthi efforts to terrorize the entire region for over 10 years.\"",
      "\"This strike was not intended to harm the people of Yemen, who rightly want to throw off the yoke of Houthi subjugation and live peacefully,\" it added. It didn't acknowledge any casualties and declined to comment when asked by The Associated Press regarding civilians reportedly being killed.",
      "The Ras Isa port, a collection of three oil tanks and refining equipment, sits in Yemen's Hodeida governorate along the Red Sea. NASA satellites that track forest fires showed an intense blaze early Friday morning at the site just off Kamaran Island, targeted by intense U.S. airstrikes over the last few days.",
      "The Ras Isa port also is the terminus of an oil pipeline stretching to Yemen's energy-rich Marib governorate that's still held by allies of Yemen's exiled government. The Houthis expelled that government from Yemen's capital, Sanaa, back in 2015. However, oil exports have been halted by the decadelong war and the Houthis have used Ras Isa to bring in oil.",
      "The Houthis and Iran denounced the U.S. attack.",
      "\"This completely unjustified aggression represents a flagrant violation of Yemen's sovereignty and independence and a direct targeting of the entire Yemeni people,\" the Houthis said in a statement carried by the SABA news agency they control. \"It targets a vital civilian facility that has served the Yemeni people for decades.\"",
      "Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Tehran \"strongly condemned the barbaric U.S. air strike,\" calling it \"an example of aggressive crime and a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of the U.N. Charter,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "On April 9, the U.S. State Department issued a warning about oil shipments to Yemen.",
      "\"The United States will not tolerate any country or commercial entity providing support to foreign terrorist organizations, such as the Houthis, including offloading ships and provisioning oil at Houthi-controlled ports,\" it said.",
      "The attack follows Israeli airstrikes on the Houthis that previously hit port and oil infrastructure used by the rebels after their attacks on Israel.",
      "U.S. says Chinese satellite image provider is aiding Houthis",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce in a briefing with journalists accused Chang Guang Satellite Technology Co. Ltd., a commercial satellite image provider, of \"directly supporting Iran-backed Houthi terrorist attacks on U.S. interests.\"",
      "Bruce didn't elaborate in detail, but acknowledged a story by The Financial Times that quoted anonymous American officials saying the firm linked to the People's Liberation Army has provided images enabling the rebels to target U.S. warships and commercial vessels traveling through the Red Sea corridor.",
      "\"Beijing's support, by the way, of that company, the satellite company, even after we've engaged in discussions with them about this ... certainly contradicts their claims of being peace supporters,\" Bruce said.",
      "Chinese officials and the company, known by the acronym CGSTL, couldn't be immediately reached for comment. Chinese state media didn't acknowledge the accusation. The U.S. Treasury sanctioned CGSTL in 2023 for allegedly providing satellite images to the Russian mercenary force the Wagner Group as it fought in Ukraine as part of Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "An AP review has found the new U.S. operation against the Houthis under Mr. Trump appears more extensive than the one under former President Joe Biden, as Washington moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel and dropping bombs on cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \"Israeli\" ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip as that war grinds on. The rebels have loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning many vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. That's greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it. The Houthis also launched attacks targeting American warships, without success.",
      "The U.S. campaign shows no signs of stopping, as the Trump administration has also linked its airstrikes on the Houthis to an effort to pressure Iran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program. A second round of negotiations between Iran and the U.S. is due to happen Saturday in Rome.",
      "The stakes of the negotiations couldn't be higher for the two nations\u00a0closing in on half a century of enmity. Mr, Trump repeatedly has threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program if a deal isn't reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",

    "story": [
      "Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen says he has met with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who immigration officials say was deported by error, in El Salvador on Thursday, Van Hollen's spokesperson confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Democratic senator shared a photo with Abrego Garcia at what appears to be a restaurant.",
      "\"I said my main goal of this trip was to meet with Kilmar,\" Sen. Van Hollen said. \"Tonight I had that chance. I have called his wife, Jennifer, to pass along his message of love. I look forward to providing a full update upon my return.\"",

      "Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele also posted photos\u00a0of the meeting, but suggested Abrego Garcia will remain incarcerated by his government, which is being paid by the United States to hold deportees: \"Now that he's been confirmed healthy, he gets the honor of staying in El Salvador's custody.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez, said in a statement after the meeting her \"prayers have been answered.\"",
      "\"We still have so many questions, hopes, and fears. I will continue praying and fighting for Kilma's' return home,\" Vasquez wrote.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai called Van Hollen's visit \"truly disgusting,\" writing, \"Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist.\" Abrego Garcia's lawyers have strongly denied any connections to MS-13.",
      "The surprise meeting with Van Hollen marks Abrego Garcia's first known appearance since last month, when his deportation to El Salvador's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center drew national attention and sparked a legal standoff with the Trump administration.",
      "The administration admitted in court papers Abrego Garcia was sent to El Salvador \u2014 along with hundreds of other Salvadoran and Venezuelan migrants \u2014 due to an \"administrative error.\" U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return to the United States, and the Supreme Court backed up that order, but he has remained in El Salvador since then, with Xinis suggesting the government hasn't complied with her order and demanding regular updates on his status.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, arguing it's up to El Salvador to decide whether to return Abrego Garcia \u2014 an argument an appeals court called \"shocking\" on Thursday. The government has also alleged Abrego Garcia is linked to Salvadoran gang MS-13, citing a confidential informant, though his attorneys have denied that allegation and noted Abrego Garcia has not been charged or convicted of any crimes.",
      "Abrego Garcia, 29, was born in El Salvador but entered the United States illegally in 2011 at the age of 16. He was arrested outside a Maryland Home Depot in 2019, but a judge barred the government from deporting him to El Salvador, warning he could be persecuted by gangs in his home country. Years later, in March of this year, he was detained by immigration agents in Maryland and sent to the Salvadoran detention center, known as CECOT.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case is at the center of a controversial push by the Trump administration to send scores of migrants \u2014 including accused members of MS-13 and Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua \u2014 to CECOT using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which allows the president to deport citizens of an enemy nation during an \"invasion or predatory incursion.\" The gambit has been challenged in court, with opponents decrying conditions in CECOT and\u00a0arguing the government is denying migrants the right to due process. A \"60 Minutes\" report found most of the 238 Venezuelans sent to CECOT on several planes last month had no apparent criminal record. But the Trump administration has defended its use of the law, arguing it is cracking down on gang violence.",
      "Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia\u00a0came after the senator was turned away Thursday at a military checkpoint near CECOT. He said he was about three kilometers from the notorious supermax prison, when he was stopped by soldiers, who he said were ordered to prevent him from going toward the prison.",
      "Van Hollen left for El Salvador on Wednesday, intending to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being. He provided updates on his journey.",
      "\"My overall purpose here is to send a signal that we are not going to stop fighting for his return until he is actually released,\" Van Hollen said before his flight.",

    "story": [
      "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is meeting at the White House on Thursday with President Trump, in what her aides have called a high-stakes \"commercial peace mission.\"",
      "European leaders are hoping Italy's right-wing premier\u00a0can position herself as a bridge between the Trump administration and the European Union, which Mr. Trump and his top aides have bashed as a deadbeat, if not abusive partner on defense and trade.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday that \"of course\" there will be a trade deal with the EU, amid the 90-day pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariffs. Asked if the EU is on his priority list of nations for reaching trade deals, Mr. Trump said, \"Everybody's on my priority list.\"",
      "The president said he and Meloni discussed trade and \"many, many things\" in their first meeting of the day. But it's unclear how much progress Mr. Trump and Meloni made in discussing any sort of trade deal.",
      "The hope not only in Rome, but in EU capitals across the 27-nation bloc is likely that Meloni can persuade Mr. Trump not to impose the steep tariff hikes he's threatened, which could devastate European economies. A reporter asked Meloni if she believes the U.S. is a reliable partner.",
      "\"If I wouldn't think it's a reliable partner, I wouldn't be here,\" Meloni responded.",
      "Meloni said she's \"here to find the best way to make us both stronger.\"",
      "\"The goal for me is to make the West great again,\" Meloni said. \"And I think we can do it together.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters he believes there have been trade calls with the EU already, and the U.S. is trying to work with the world's 15 largest economies first. The president said \"tariffs are making us rich.\"",
      "Meloni and Trump seem to \"get along great\"",
      "Meloni has positioned herself as the European leader Mr. Trump is most likely to listen to. The two have developed a relationship based on shared political and ideological affinities on issues including immigration and LGBTQ rights.",
      "Meloni was the only European leader to be invited to Mr. Trump's inauguration in January, and he has praised her multiple times, calling her a \"fantastic leader and person,\" and someone he could potentially work with to \"straighten out the world a little bit.\"",
      "After the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris last year, which both leaders attended, Mr. Trump was quoted by the New York Post as saying: \"I was with her a lot\" and \"we get along great.\"",
      "But the Italian leader will have to try to balance that budding special relationship with her mandate to protect the interests not only of her own nation's economy, but the EU's, with which Italy's financial future is inextricably linked.",
      "Europe has hope, and anxiety, over the Trump-Meloni meeting",
      "Meloni and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen discussed strategies on how to approach her meeting with Mr. Trump during multiple phone calls ahead of the trip, according to a commission spokesperson.",
      "Von der Leyen herself has not yet been granted a meeting with Mr. Trump, despite repeated requests. Meloni's sit-down at the White House will be the first with any European leader since the administration announced its tariffs on virtually every nation with which the U.S. conducts trade at the beginning of April. The EU was hit with a blanket 20% tariff rate on all exports to the U.S. with that announcement, though Mr. Trump put those higher rates on hold for 90 days about a week later, as global stock markets reeled, leaving a 10% universal rate in place.",
      "Meloni has gently chided the sweeping tariffs on the EU as \"wrong,\" but she's been one of the voices urging the continental bloc not to impose retaliatory measures, insisting that a calm response focused on negotiations would bring a more constructive resolution.",
      "The White House claims dozens of counties have come forward seeking to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S., with Mr. Trump boasting that leaders were calling him and \"kissing my ass,\" begging to strike deals to avoid the reimposition of the higher levies.",
      "\"We know we're going through a difficult period, let's see how it goes in the coming hours. I am feeling no pressure, as you can imagine, for my next two days,\" Meloni said with a note of clear irony at an awards ceremony two days before her White House meeting. \"I am aware of what I represent, and I am aware of what I am defending.\"",
      "Not all European politicians were so sanguine about the potential outcome of the Trump-Meloni meeting, however.\u00a0 Italian opposition politician Carlo Calenda said, \"the most important thing is that Meloni does not allow herself to be used by Trump to split the European front.\"",
      "In other European capitals, there was clear anxiety over the possibility that the White House could use the meeting to try to undermine EU unity.",
      "\"If we start having bilateral discussions, obviously it will break the current dynamic,\" the French government's Minister for Industry and Energy, Marc Ferracci, said last week, adding: \"Europe is only strong if it is united.\"",
      "The French news agency AFP said a government spokeswoman later stressed that any voices capable of encouraging dialogue between Washington and the EU were to be welcomed. That statement echoed the remarks by the EU spokesperson on Monday, who noted the close coordination between Meloni and Von der Leyen ahead of the Italian leader's trip to Washington and said the \"outreach is very welcome.\"",
      "After her brief visit to Washington the Italian leader will return home, where she's expected to meet on Friday with Vice President JD Vance during his visit to the Italian capital and the Vatican.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin have met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office since he took office for his second term, but those encounters all came prior to the massive tariffs announcement on April 2.",

Sullivan, originally from Tennessee, was abducted at gunpoint\u00a0during a prayer meeting at his church in South Africa on the evening of April 10.",
      "According to a statement issued by the the South African Police Service, a specialized unit dedicated to serious crime, known as the Hawks, they led the operation to rescue the 45-year-old.",
      "The American was abducted from his Fellowship Baptist Church in Motherwell Township, outside the coastal city of Gqeberha, and was rescued from a safehouse being used by his captors in that city.",
      "\"The operation followed verified intelligence wherein a coordinated team (of several police units) moved swiftly to the identified location,\" police said. \"As officers approached the house, they observed a vehicle on the premises.

    "story": [
      "An American YouTuber who was arrested after visiting an off-limits island in the Indian Ocean with hopes of establishing contact with a reclusive tribe was further detained in custody on Thursday. The 24-year-old was initially arrested more than six years after another American was\u00a0killed\u00a0with arrows by the tribe on the same island.",
      "Mykhailo Viktorovych Polyakov will next appear before a local court in Port Blair \u2014 the capital of India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands \u2014 on April 29, police said.",
      "Polyakov, from Scottsdale, Arizona, was arrested on March 31, two days after he set foot on the restricted territory of North Sentinel Island in a bid to meet people from the reclusive Sentinelese tribe.",
      "\"It may be claimed to be an adventure trip, but the fact is that there has been a violation of Indian laws. Outsiders meeting Sentinelese could endanger the tribe's survival,\" said a senior police officer, requesting anonymity as he isn't authorized to speak about the case under investigation.",
      "Polyakov is suspected of violating Indian laws that carry a possible sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine.",
      "Visitors are banned from traveling within 3 miles of North Sentinel Island, whose population has been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years. The inhabitants use spears and bows and arrows to hunt the animals that roam the small, heavily forested island. Deeply suspicious of outsiders, they attack anyone who lands onto their beaches.",
      "In 2018, John Allen Chau, an American missionary who landed illegally on the beach was killed by North Sentinelese Islanders who apparently shot him with arrows and then buried his body on the beach. In 2006, the Sentinelese had killed two fishermen who had accidentally landed on the shore.",
      "An official from the U.S. consulate visited Polyakov in jail earlier this week. The U.S embassy in Delhi didn't immediately respond to a request confirming the visit or any further updates on Polyakov.",
      "Police said Polyakov had conducted detailed research on sea conditions, tides and accessibility to the island before starting his journey. He stayed on the beach for about an hour, blowing a whistle to attract the attention but got no response from the islanders.",
      "The young American had twice attempted to visit the island in the past, and left a can of Diet Coke and a coconut as offering for the tribe this time after he failed to contact the Sentinelese. He shot a video of the island on his camera and collected some sand samples before returning to his boat.",
      "After his arrest, the charity Survival International\u00a0issued a statement,\u00a0calling Polyakov's actions \"deeply disturbing.\"",
      "\"It beggars belief that someone could be that reckless and idiotic,\" the group's director, Carolina Pearce, said. \"This person's actions not only endangered his own life, they put the lives of the entire Sentinelese tribe at risk. It's very well known by now that uncontacted peoples have no immunity to common outside diseases like flu or measles, which could completely wipe them out.\"",
      "On his return he was spotted by local fishermen, who informed the authorities and Polyakov was arrested in Port Blair, an archipelago nearly 750 miles east of India's mainland.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guantanamo-trump-migrants-without-criminal-records/",
    "published": "Thu, 17 Apr 2025 07:05:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay\u200b.",
    "story": [
      "A government memo obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay, allowing officials to send non-criminal detainees there despite a vow to hold \"the worst\" offenders at the naval base.",
      "As part of his aggressive crackdown on immigration, President Trump in late January directed officials to convert facilities inside the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into holding sites for migrants living in the country illegally. At the time, Mr. Trump said \"the worst\" migrants would be held at the base, directing officials to make space for \"high-priority criminal aliens.\"",
      "But a previously undisclosed agreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Defense indicates that the Trump administration gave officials wide-ranging discretion to decide who to send to Guantanamo Bay, enacting criteria not predicated on the severity of detainees' criminal history or conduct. In fact, the memo does not mention any criminality assessment. [Read the full memo at the bottom of this story.]",
      "Instead, the agreement, signed on March 7 by top DHS and Pentagon officials, says the departments agreed to use the Guantanamo base to detain migrants with final deportation orders who have \"a nexus to a transnational criminal organization (TCO) or criminal drug activity.\"",
      "Officials defined \"nexus\" in broad terms. A nexus can be satisfied, the memo says, if migrants with final deportation orders are part of a transnational criminal group or if they paid one \"to be smuggled into the United States.\" The latter condition could be used to describe many of the migrants and asylum-seekers who have illegally crossed the U.S. southern border, as criminal groups in Mexico largely control the illicit movement of people and drugs there.",
      "Migrants who overstayed a visa are not eligible to be sent to Guantanamo Bay, the document says. But if the nature of a migrant's entry is unclear, the memo allows officials to assume that the person paid a criminal group to enter the U.S. and to send them to Guantanamo if they hail from a nation \"where the preponderance of aliens from that country enter the United States in that fashion.\"",
      "The conditions for transferring migrants to Guantanamo, as outlined in the memo, seem to be at odds with statements by Mr. Trump and high-ranking members of his administration that have suggested the base would be used as a detention site for dangerous criminals.",
      "Theresa Cardinal Brown, a former U.S. immigration official during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said the memo's rules \"apply very broadly to any immigrant who came to the U.S. via the U.S.-Mexico border.\"",
      "\"It's very well known that almost every immigrant who makes it to the U.S.-Mexico border would have to pay some sort of money to the cartels that control the territory on the Mexican side, directly or indirectly,\" she said.",
      "Cardinal Brown added that the rules do not appear to include \"any individualized assessment\" to determine whether migrant detainees pose a threat, before transferring them to Guantanamo.",
      "Department of Defense spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson confirmed the existence of the memo, saying it \"strengthens DoD and DHS collaboration by clarifying roles and responsibilities, and fostering efficient and coordinated operations at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to DHS representatives for comment.",
      "The Guantanamo operation is not the only Trump administration immigration effort to face scrutiny over who exactly has been targeted. In mid-March, for example, the administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador, so they could be imprisoned inside that country's infamous mega-prison. The Trump administration said they were all criminals and gang members, but a \"60 Minutes\" investigation did not find a criminal record for 75% of the Venezuelan deportees.",
      "A high-profile yet largely secretive operation",
      "The Trump administration first began sending migrants to Guantanamo in February, initially only transferring Venezuelans there, including men it accused of having ties to the Tren de Aragua prison gang. The first group of Venezuelan detainees was eventually flown to Honduras, where the Venezuelan government picked them up so they could be transported back to their homeland.",
      "Since then, the administration has sporadically flown migrants from different countries to the base, before transferring them back to the U.S. or other nations. Administration officials have regularly touted the flights to Guantanamo but have provided limited details about the operation, including on costs and who is eligible to be sent to the base.",
      "What has been publicly revealed, by CBS News and other media outlets, is that officials have transferred both detainees considered to be \"high-threat\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, including migrants whose relatives have denied allegations of gang membership and criminality.",
      "Government guidelines define migrant detainees as posing a \"high\" threat if they have violent or serious criminal records, histories of disruptive conduct or alleged gang ties. Low-risk detainees are defined as migrants who face deportation because they are in the U.S. illegally but who lack any serious criminal record \u2014 or any at all.",
      "Those sent to Guantanamo and considered to be \"high-threat\" migrants have been held at Camp VI, a section of the post-9/11 prison that still houses roughly a dozen terrorism suspects. Migrant detainees deemed to pose a \"low\" risk have been transferred to the base's Migrant Operations Center, a barrack-like facility that has historically housed asylum-seekers intercepted at sea.",
      "Wilson, the Department of Defense spokeswoman, said there are currently 42 migrants detained at Guantanamo, 32 of them housed at the Migrant Operations Center and 10 so-called \"high-threat\" detainees held at Camp VI.",
      "The March 7 memo obtained by CBS News sheds light on other aspects of operations at Guantanamo. For example, it confirms the migrant detainees transported there remain in the legal custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, even though the military is providing access to its facilities to detain them.",
      "As part of the agreement, DHS also accepted the conditions at Camp VI and the Migrant Operations Center as adequate to hold migrant adults, noting it would not transfer children to the base. The department agreed to send ICE officers or contractors to the base, including to oversee security at the Migrant Operations Center.",
      "The memo makes DHS responsible for providing detainees services like recreation and religious accommodations; determining whether migrants get access to lawyers; and administering \"involuntary medical treatment,\" such as force-feeding during hunger strikes.",
      "The agreement also charges DHS with overseeing the transfer of detainees from and to Guantanamo, requiring the department to relocate migrants from the base no more than 180 days after their deportation orders are issued.",
      "The military, as stipulated by the agreement, is principally responsible for providing security at Camp VI and in the perimeter of the facilities. It also agreed to provide toilets and hygiene facilities, as well as medical care to both ICE personnel and detained migrants.",
      "The memo says the Department of Defense committed to erect tents at the base to hold additional detainees, though those sites have not been used to detain migrants yet. The agreement notes, however, that those tents \"do not have power, lighting, or heating/air conditioning.\"",
      "The effort to hold migrants at Guantanamo faces legal challenges by advocates, including at the American Civil Liberties Union, the Trump administration's chief adversary in federal court.",
      "The ACLU alleged in court filings that migrants were initially held incommunicado at Guantanamo, without access to relatives or lawyers. The administration subsequently said it took steps to give migrant detainees access to lawyers.",
      "The ACLU has also described detention conditions at Guantanamo as deplorable, citing declarations from migrants held there. In one of those declarations, a Venezuelan man previously held at the base said he went on a hunger strike after feeling he had been \"kidnapped.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the lead architect of the Trump administration's immigration agenda, said earlier this week there are no plans to stop using Guantanamo to detain migrants.",
      "\"It's wide open,\" Miller said on Fox News. \"Gitmo is open.\"",

      "\"The entire island is without generation,\" he said.",

He attempted to set the record straight on what\u2019s now being dubbed \"margarita-gate,\" a viral photo posted by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele that appeared to show the senator and Garcia sitting casually at a table with two salt-rimmed drinks.",
      "\"Let me just be very clear,\" Van Hollen said. \"Neither of us touched the drinks that were in front of us. And if you want to play a little Sherlock Holmes, I\u2019ll tell you how you can know that. \u2026 If you sip out of one of those glasses, some of whatever it was \u2014 salt or sugar \u2014 would disappear.

      "\"This is a lesson into the lengths that President Bukele will do to deceive people,\" Van Hollen said. \"And it also shows the lengths that the Trump administration and the president will go to, because when he was asked by a reporter about this, he just went along for the ride.\"",

      "Data breaches usually happen for one reason \u2014 financial gain. This often involves selling stolen information to scammers or hackers who use it for fraudulent activities, such as running credit fraud schemes. Since many forms of identity theft revolve around credit accounts, it\u2019s crucial to take action if your or a loved one\u2019s personal data has been exposed.",
      "One of the most effective ways to prevent credit fraud is by placing a security freeze on your credit accounts. A security freeze stops anyone from opening new accounts, issuing new cards or conducting any credit-related activities in your name while the freeze is in place.",
      "If managing this process feels overwhelming, consider using an identity theft protection service. These services can handle placing and managing security freezes on your behalf, saving you time and ensuring the process is done correctly. Many of these services also offer additional features, such as credit monitoring and alerts, to help you stay on top of potential threats to your personal information. Taking this step can significantly reduce the risk of identity theft and provide peace of mind that your financial information is secure.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "A fraud alert is an extra layer of protection for your credit accounts. Like a credit freeze, you can set it up with all three credit bureaus.",
      "When you activate a fraud alert, it notifies the bureaus that there may be suspicious activity on your account. As a result, any attempts to open new credit or make changes will be looked at more carefully.",

      "RFID skimming: Some credit and debit cards are equipped with RFID chips that enable contactless payments. Thieves carrying\u00a0handheld RFID readers can capture your card\u2019s data simply by being near you. No physical contact is required, and you often won\u2019t even notice it happening.Card skimming at ATMs and terminals: In some regions, criminals install\u00a0fake card readers over legitimate machines at airports, gas stations or retail locations. These skimmers copy your card\u2019s information when you insert it. In many cases, a hidden camera is also installed nearby to record your PIN as you type it.Pickpocketing and physical theft: Airports are full of distractions, which thieves rely on. A quick bump in a security line or a moment of inattention at the check-in counter is all it takes for someone to slip your wallet out of a bag or pocket.Public Wi-Fi snooping: Using\u00a0unsecured airport or hotel Wi-Fi can expose your private data. Hackers connected to the same network can intercept sensitive information, including credit card numbers and login credentials, especially if you're making purchases or accessing banking apps without protection.Lost or stolen cards: It's not uncommon to misplace a card during travel. If someone finds it \u2013 or worse, steals it from your luggage or hotel room \u2013 they could make unauthorized purchases before you realize it\u2019s missing.",

With a few smart habits and the right tools, you can avoid the most common threats and enjoy your trip with more peace of mind. Here are some easy ways to keep your cards safe while you're on the move.",
      "A man holding a credit card wallet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THIS IS HOW TO PROTECT YOUR CREDIT AND BANK CARDS FROM GETTING HACKED",
      "Some credit cards include RFID chips that make contactless payments easy and convenient. However, this same feature can be exploited if someone with the right equipment gets close enough to scan your card without your knowledge. Using\u00a0RFID-blocking gear such as a wallet, card sleeve or passport holder is a simple and affordable way to prevent this type of theft. These items are widely available and effective at blocking unauthorized scans.",
      "Limiting the number of cards you bring reduces the risk of your wallet being lost or stolen. Ideally,\u00a0take only one or two credit cards that you plan to use during your trip. Keep any backup cards in your hotel safe and store a secure digital record of your card details in a\u00a0password manager. This can be helpful if you need to cancel or replace a card while you\u2019re abroad. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Most credit card companies offer instant notifications through their mobile apps. Turning on transaction alerts ensures you\u2019ll be notified the moment your card is used, allowing you to spot suspicious activity quickly. If your card issuer offers the ability to lock your card directly from the app, enable that feature as well, so you can act immediately if anything looks off.",
      "Public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels and caf\u00e9s is rarely secure. Avoid entering credit card information or logging into banking websites while on these networks, unless you're using a virtual private network (VPN).

Gently wiggle the card reader or look for anything that seems loose, bulky or out of place. When possible, use ATMs inside banks or secure buildings instead of freestanding machines, which are easier for thieves to target.",
      "Many credit card apps now allow you to temporarily lock your card with a single tap. If you're not planning to use a card for a day or two, consider locking it until you're ready to make a purchase. This simple habit adds an extra layer of protection. If someone tries to use the card while it\u2019s locked, the transaction will be declined.",
      "Apple Pay and\u00a0Google Pay provide an additional level of security by creating unique, one-time-use codes for every transaction.

      "1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or even lab records, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks. These emails might include malicious links designed to install malware or steal login information. To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the LSC breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the LSC breach, including Social Security numbers, insurance info and even medical IDs. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Keep tabs on your medical records:\u00a0The LSC breach included lab results, diagnoses and treatment data, making medical identity theft a growing concern. Someone could use your info to get care or prescriptions under your name. Regularly review your medical records and insurance claims. If anything looks off, report it to your provider or insurer immediately.",
      "6. Watch out for suspicious snail mail: After the LSC data breach, attackers may use your stolen information to send official-looking letters by post, posing as healthcare providers, insurers or even government agencies. These letters might ask you to call a number, visit a website or provide additional personal information. Just because it arrives in your mailbox doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s trustworthy. Always verify the source by looking up contact details independently and avoid responding directly to unsolicited mail asking for sensitive information.",
      "7. Use multifactor authentication (MFA): Enable\u00a0MFA on all critical accounts like email, banking apps and healthcare portals. Look in account settings under \"security\" or \"login options\" to activate it. MFA ensures that even if hackers have your password, they\u2019ll need another verification method (like a text code) before accessing your account.",
      "8. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year, or more frequently if you're concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "9. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",
      "11. Secure your online accounts: Review security settings across all important accounts (email, especially). Update recovery options like backup emails or phone numbers and log out of devices you don\u2019t recognize. Compromised accounts can lead hackers straight into other parts of your digital life.",
      "By following these steps, you\u2019ll be taking comprehensive action against potential threats stemming from the LSC data breach.",

      "How it works",
      "The system uses devices such as high-density electrode arrays that record neural activity directly from the brain's surface. It also works with microelectrodes that penetrate the brain\u2019s surface and non-invasive surface electromyography sensors placed on the face to measure muscle activity. These devices tap into the brain to measure neural activity, which the AI then learns to transform into the sounds of the patient's voice.",
      "The neuroprosthesis samples neural data from the brain's motor cortex, the area controlling speech production, and AI decodes that data into speech.

Windows 10 remains the operating system of choice for many, even though Microsoft has shifted its focus entirely to Windows 11. In fact, the Redmond-based company will end security updates for Windows 10 this October.",

      "A person typing on a Windows laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Critical Windows 10 security flaws exploited",
      "The vulnerabilities in question were part of a recent Microsoft Patch Tuesday update, a monthly release where the company addresses security flaws. In this case, six specific exploits were identified as being actively used by hackers to target Windows 10 systems. These exploits are particularly alarming because they are already in the wild, meaning attackers are leveraging them to compromise systems before all users have had a chance to update their devices.",
      "The affected population, estimated at 240 million, refers to users whose PCs cannot upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations, such as lacking TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module) or other system requirements.",
      "The six exploits include a mix of flaws that allow hackers to achieve various malicious outcomes, such as executing arbitrary code, escalating privileges to take full control of a system or bypassing security features.",
      "For example, one exploit might overload system memory to overwrite critical data (a buffer overflow), while another could allow attackers to access sensitive information by exploiting a flaw in the Windows Kernel. These vulnerabilities are especially dangerous because they can be triggered remotely or through seemingly innocuous actions, like opening a malicious file or mounting a compromised virtual hard disk.",

The agency even suggested turning off unpatched computers as a precaution. Updating to the latest Windows 10 patch is the simplest and most effective way to protect against these exploits right now.",
      "However, a bigger problem looms later this year. Microsoft will officially end free security updates for Windows 10 on October 14, 2025. After that, systems running Windows 10 will no longer receive critical security patches, unless users enroll in Microsoft\u2019s Extended Security Updates (ESU) program.",
      "This ESU program will be available to individual users for the first time and will cost $30 per device for one additional year of updates. It\u2019s designed to give users more time to transition, especially those who can\u2019t upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations. While this offers a temporary reprieve, it's not a long-term solution; the ESU program will only extend support for a limited time (typically three years in enterprise settings) and prices may increase annually.",
      "The scale of the problem remains significant. Millions of devices lack the hardware requirements for Windows 11, such as TPM 2.0 and newer CPUs, making the shift costly or impractical for some.

      "2) Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3) Plan for the future:\u00a0The clock is ticking on Windows 10\u2019s security updates. If your hardware can\u2019t handle Windows 11, weigh your long-term options. Buying a new PC might be inevitable, but you could also explore alternatives like Linux, which offers free, secure operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu or Linux Mint) that run well on older hardware.",

      "The road ahead for Windows 10 users is anything but smooth. With critical vulnerabilities emerging and official support coming to an end, millions are being pushed into a difficult decision. They can upgrade their hardware, pay for temporary patches or continue using increasingly vulnerable systems. As October draws closer, the risks will only increase. Updating your system is essential, but it\u2019s just a short-term measure. Now is the time to start preparing for what comes after, before the window of protection closes for good.",

      "The rise of robotic dairy farms",
      "In a dairy barn managed by robots, cows can choose to be milked whenever they like, which is often more frequent than the twice-a-day schedule in traditional farms. This increased frequency is more comfortable for the cows and can lead to roughly a 10% increase in milk production.",
      "Lely, established in 1948 in the Netherlands, introduced its first Astronaut milking robot in the early 1990s. Since then, the company has developed various robotic systems that assist with cleaning, feeding and ensuring cow comfort. Today, Lely is focused entirely on robots for dairy farms, with approximately 135,000 units deployed worldwide.",

      "From milking to manure: How robots lighten the load for dairy farmers",
      "Traditional dairy farms rely heavily on human labor for repetitive daily tasks, which can take up about a third of a farmer's workday. These tasks include milking, feeding and manure management. Lely's robots automate these tasks, allowing dairy farmers to focus on other aspects of their business and enjoy a more flexible lifestyle. The Astronaut A5 milking robot, for example, uses a laser-guided robot arm to clean the cow's udder before attaching teat cups. It also monitors milk output and collects data on 32 parameters, including milk quality and cow health indicators.",

      "Dairy industry 4.0",
      "The introduction of milking machines in the early 1900s and rural electrification in the 1950s significantly increased farm size and milk production. Lely believes that robots will enable small dairy farms to continue scaling sustainably. While dairy robots are expensive, Lely argues that they pay for themselves over time through increased milk production and lower labor costs. Other robots, such as the Vector mobile robot for continuous feeding and feed pushing, and the Discovery Collector, a robotic manure vacuum, further reduce labor needs.",
      "AI also plays a critical role in optimizing feeding systems, reducing waste and improving sustainability, which are key factors in modern dairy farming. Wearable technology and smart sensors are also becoming increasingly important tools in herd health monitoring, offering farmers real-time insights into cow well-being and productivity.",

      "SCARY AI-POWERED SWARM ROBOTS TEAM UP TO BUILD CARS FASTER THAN EVER",
      "Cows vs robots",
      "Cows are curious animals and tend to interact with robots. Lely has had to cow-proof its robots to ensure they can function autonomously around cows. This includes modifying the robots' design and programming, such as adding contact-sensing bumpers and relocating emergency stop buttons. Engineers have also had to consider the social dynamics within a herd. For example, the Discovery Collector robot had to be programmed to assert its dominance within the herd to avoid being blocked by cows.",
      "Lely recognizes the importance of designing robots that are not only functional but also trustworthy and reliable. Jan Jacobs emphasizes that the robots are not intended to be friends with the cows or the farmers but rather professional employees.",

      "Lely is working to integrate its robots seamlessly into the daily lives of dairy farmers, who are increasingly becoming robot managers. This requires farmers to manage the robots and learn how to interpret the data they generate. The additional time and flexibility afforded by robots have allowed some dairy farmers to diversify their operations. One Lely customer, for example, has added a restaurant and farm shop to his dairy, allowing patrons to observe the robots at work while enjoying cheese made from the cows they care for.",
      "Lely helps farmers prepare for the shift to robotic dairy farming, both in terms of the physical environment and their mindset. This includes managing the massive amount of data generated by the robots and using it for long-term optimization.",
      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Flexibility and sustainability",
      "Many dairy farms are adopting robots to decrease their dependence on hired help and gain greater flexibility. Farmers report that robots have allowed them to prioritize their personal lives and spend more quality time with their families. Robots also contribute to the long-term viability of smaller dairy farms by making the profession more appealing to younger generations. The reduced workload and commitment associated with robotic farming make it a more attractive career path.",
      "Astronaut milking robot (Lely) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "What is quantum internet?",
      "Quantum internet is a next-generation network that uses the power of physics to send data in a way that\u2019s ultra-secure and computationally infeasible to hack. Quantum internet, quantum networks and quantum communication are all connected but have different roles.",
      "Quantum internet refers to the entire system that allows ultra-secure communication. Quantum networks are the infrastructure that connect quantum devices. Quantum communication is the actual exchange of information over these networks. Unlike today\u2019s internet, which sends data as either a 0 or a 1, quantum internet relies on quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist as both 0 and 1 at the same time.",
      "This results in an encryption method that is nearly impossible to break, making it one of the most secure ways to communicate. What makes quantum internet even safer is a phenomenon called entanglement. When qubits become entangled, they stay connected no matter how far apart they are. If one qubit is changed, the other changes instantly. Any attempt to disrupt the entanglement, such as hacking, would immediately alert both people communicating.",

      "While the potential of quantum internet is exciting, there are still hurdles to overcome. The technology is still in early development, with most experiments confined to research labs. Unlike the traditional internet, quantum networks need specialized equipment to keep signals strong across cities or even countries. Developing this technology requires massive investments and breakthroughs before quantum internet can become widely available. Another key challenge is the transition from today\u2019s internet to quantum internet.",
      "Since most existing technology is built for current networks, the shift won\u2019t happen overnight. Instead, hybrid systems that combine elements of both traditional and quantum communication can serve as a bridge, helping businesses, governments and everyday users to adapt without disrupting the current digital infrastructure.",
      "Despite these challenges, progress is happening. Major countries, including the U.S., are investing heavily in quantum research, and scientists have successfully demonstrated that the technology works. While it may take years before quantum internet reaches everyday users, these breakthroughs are laying the foundation for a safer, more private digital future.",

      "While quantum internet is a ways away, it's important to stay safe on the internet we use today. Until that new technology arrives, here are a few ways to protect yourself online.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Until a more secure internet becomes available, it's important to use tools that help protect against everyday threats like unsafe links and malware. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Be careful when using public Wi-Fi: Public Wi-Fi remains one of the easiest ways for hackers to access your data.\u00a0The temptations and risks of free Wi-Fi make it important to think twice before connecting to an unsecured network. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts or entering personal details unless you're using a VPN or other form of encryption.",
      "3) Use a VPN: Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Invest in personal data removal services: While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Until more advanced security becomes mainstream,\u00a02FA is a simple way to protect your accounts. It adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second step to log in, like a code sent to your phone. For even stronger protection, consider using a\u00a0security key that plugs into your device.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Quantum internet represents a large shift in how we think about communication, privacy and security. By harnessing the power of physics, it promises to create a network that\u2019s faster, more secure and more private than anything we\u2019ve seen before. While the technology is still emerging, it has the potential to change the internet forever.",

      "Between late January into February, the town got so much snowfall it ran out of road salt, and there was an increase in police calls.

Between 2021 and 2024, the department issued between 439 and 653 over the same period.

    "summary": "A California trial lawyer breaks down an analysis of what the judge in the Menendez brothers resentencing hearings is considering when factoring in a potential prison release.",
    "story": [
      "A California legal analyst and trial lawyer says there are many factors a judge will consider on whether Erik and Lyle Menendez are fit to be released from prison.",
      "LOS ANGELES \u2013 As the fate of the Menendez brothers is paused for another month, a legal analyst and trial lawyer says the fact that their freedom is even a discussion is thanks to a new law signed in by Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "Roger Bonakdar, a California-based attorney, shared with Fox News Digital that after nearly 35 years behind bars, Erik and Lyle Menendez were given new hope to leave prison behind thanks to former Los Angeles County George Gascon and the passing of AB 600.",
      "The law allows individuals who remain incarcerated under sentences that were imposed when harsher, less flexible laws were in effect, to petition for a review of their sentences, so they can benefit from more recent legislative reforms that focus on rehabilitation, according to the law's text.",
      "\"What's happening is that the prior DA Gascon, infamous for certain policies and practices that he instituted in LA County which many credit with the explosion of violent crime and theft in LA, had filed a motion with the court to have the Menendez brothers re-sentenced,\" Bonakdar explained.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS CASE: WHAT'S NEXT FOR KILLERS AFTER DEFENSE, DA SPAR OVER RESENTENCING",
      "Lyle, left, and Erik Menendez sit with defense attorney Leslie Abramson, right, in Beverly Hills Municipal Court during a hearing, Nov. 26, 1990.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Nick Ut)",
      "Bonakdar said that Gascon's argument was that the Menendez brothers are \"allegedly no longer a threat to the community and that they've served their debt to society,\" because of their ages at the time of their conviction and sentence.",
      "\"Gascon also apparently made a point of their defense, which didn't fly at trial, about their alleged sexual abuse at the hands of their now-murdered father. So, what's happening now is that the current DA has sought leave of court to withdraw or to take back Gascon's motion because he doesn't believe that the Menendez brothers are worthy or deserving of re-sentencing, and that's what's before the court.\"",
      "Bonakdar said what makes this hearing even more interesting is that the judge's powers are \"pretty broad\" and he can \"re-sentence them based on an offense that they weren't convicted of.\"",
      "\"The judge can even sentence them according to what is called a lesser included offense. That means an offense that acts are part of, or otherwise included in, the charge they went to trial on, which could include second-degree murder, even voluntary manslaughter, arguably under the statute. I would imagine the judge would be hard-pressed to go that far. But the powers that are given to a judge under the new statute are pretty sweeping. His discretion is very broad.\"",
      "The Menendez brothers and their supporters have been pushing for a resentencing hearing, saying the brothers were unfairly convicted to life in prison in 1996 for murdering their two parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills home in 1989.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS ATTORNEY'S FOCUS ON GRISLY PHOTOS PART OF STRATEGIC DEFENSE PLAY TO FREE KILLERS: EXPERTS",
      "Lyle and Erik Menendez are seen as young men with their mugshots overlayed. The brothers are currently serving life sentences for the murders of their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Mary Louise \"Kitty\" Menendez in 1996.\u00a0 (Ronald L. Soble/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)",
      "Their first trial ended in a mistrial, when jurors couldn't agree on their fate. After a second trial in the mid-1990s, in which some of their evidence about the alleged sexual abuse was excluded, jurors agreed with prosecutors that their motive was greed.",
      "If the judge decides to resentence the Menendez brothers, it will then be up to the state parole board to consider their release.",
      "Because they were under 26 years old at the time of the murders, under current California law, new sentences of 50 years to life would immediately make them eligible for a parole hearing.",
      "\"If this goes fully their way, they could be granted parole and be released. Their sentence could be commuted,\" Bonakdar said. \"And the reason for that is there have been certain changes in California law which allow certain offenders, if they were young enough at the time they were convicted to seek re-sentencing under these compassionate release rules that say that, for example, if you were under the age of 26 at the the time of the commission, or if you had certain other mitigating circumstances, you're eligible to apply to the court for relief.\"",
      "Bonakdar added that what's unique here is that Gascon affirmatively filed for the relief, and that the judge rejected current DA Nathan Hochman's attempt to pull back Gascon's motion.",
      "MENENDEZ BROTHERS' AUNT HOSPITALIZED AFTER DA SHARES GRAPHIC PHOTOS IN COURT: 'THERE WAS NO WARNING'",
      "\"This is pretty important because under the new law, it says that where the government, where the prosecutor moves for the release, it actually entitles the defendant, the convict, to the benefit of a presumption, meaning that the person who's seeking the reduction of sentence starts off with a presumptive that they are eligible or that they should be granted parole. So that's something that's pretty unique and is not clear from what the judge ruled when rejecting Hochman's request to withdraw that initial motion,\" Bonakdar said.",
      "What also sets this whole hearing and saga apart from others is that the Menendez brothers \"definitely have a leg up over your average criminal defendant,\" Bonakdar said.",

      "\"First of all, obviously they had resources going into this. They had hired top flight lawyers. They threw everything in the kitchen sink at this trial,\" Bonakdar said about their trials in the '90s. \"They went the distance and even testified in their criminal trials. So it's not surprising that a defendant who had that level of resources and put in that level of effort might be seeking relief now.\"",
      "Bonakdar said that the biggest thing, though, is that Gascon affirmatively filed the motion.",
      "\"There is the argument that these defendants could have sought the clemency otherwise or filed a motion based on the change in the statute. The fact that Gascon, the former district attorney, filed this independently and affirmatively on behalf of these defendants really gives them a leg up going into the hearing. Most other defendants won't have that benefit,\" Bonakdar explained.",

      "Hochman has strongly opposed the resentencing, put in motion by Gascon, but said he would consider it if both brothers \"sincerely and unequivocally admit, for the first time in over 30 years, the full range of their criminal activity and all the lies that they have told about it.\"",
      "He said in a previous statement that the brothers \"have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit, and denials,\" and that it's up to the court to factor in whether the \"lack of acceptance of responsibility for their murderous actions\" is enough to decide whether the Menendez brothers pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.",
      "Bonakdar said, in his opinion and viewpoint, that there are \"aggravating factors out there that the judge could consider and probably should\" before making his decision in May.",
      "\"Premeditated murder is an extremely serious and obviously by its nature, violent offense. And particularly, if you've got the mental ability to process the idea of murdering both your parents in cold blood, that's a grave public safety concern,\" Bonakdar said. \"The arguments on the other side are that at some point, time does heal wounds and that people can be rehabilitated and everyone is worthy of redemption. This is the argument that will be made on behalf of the Menendez brothers. While that may be true in some instances, I guess that remains to be seen for the Men\u00e9ndez boys.\"",

    "summary": "The Hamas terrorist organization is said to be struggling with a financial crisis amid Israel\u2019s current campaign. The crisis comes amid rising protests, against the group&apos;s rule.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time since Hamas seized power 18 years ago, Gazans are speaking out against Hamas at great personal risk, Fox News' Mike Tobin reports.",
      "Amid Israel\u2019s ongoing military campaign against Hamas terrorists in Gaza, the terror group is reportedly facing an unprecedented financial crisis.",
      "Earlier this week, the Wall Street Journal reported that salary payments to many Hamas government employees have ceased, and even senior officials received only half of their usual pay during Ramadan. Terrorists, who once earned $200 to $300 a month, are struggling to get paid as the IDF tightens its grip, and the flow of humanitarian aid has been cut off since the collapse of the ceasefire.",
      "Dr. Michael Milstein, head\u00a0of the Forum for\u00a0Palestinian\u00a0Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that while financial difficulties are mounting, Hamas operatives are motivated more by ideology than money. \"It\u2019s not just about a paycheck,\" Milstein said. \"Hamas provides essential supplies like food, water and medical care to families, which is crucial in today\u2019s Gaza.\" Despite the squeeze, Milstein noted that Hamas has weathered similar financial crises in the past without collapsing.",
      "ISRAEL LAUNCHES NEW GROUND OPERATION IN GAZA",
      "Israeli troops encircle Tel al-Sultan in Gaza.\u00a0 (IDF)",
      "\"Two days ago, the IDF killed the battalion commander of the Sajia area for the fifth time. Today, there\u2019s a new battalion commander. They fill the ranks. Hamas had 25,000 military operatives on October 7, and today it has a similar number, even though it lost twenty thousand. They manage with fewer experienced operatives, including children recruited from refugee camps, but manpower is always available in Gaza. As for weapons other than rockets, there is no problem\u2014RPGs, explosives, and rifles are available,\" Milstein added.",
      "Mkhaimar Abusada, a Gazan political analyst and currently a visiting scholar at Northwestern University, emphasized that Hamas will likely find ways to recover. \"Hamas has survived despite external financial pressures for nearly two decades,\" Abusada said. \"They\u2019ve bypassed sanctions and continue to exploit black market activities and taxes on merchants.\" While money may not drive Hamas fighters, Abusada suggested that the financial squeeze would complicate their operations but not lead to the group's collapse.",
      "Protesters spoke out against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. (Fox News)",
      "Before the war, according to the same Wall Street Journal article, Qatar provided Hamas with monthly transfers of $15 million, helping to build a stockpile of around $500 million, much of it stored in Turkey. However,\u00a0Israel\u2019s tightened blockade\u00a0has limited access to these funds, forcing Hamas to rely on new income sources, such as black-market activities and taxes. \"Still, Hamas continues to manage through illicit financial flows, circumventing Israel, U.S., and international sanctions with relative ease,\" Abusada said.",
      "Amid the financial crisis, protests against Hamas have started to gain traction. Initially small, demonstrations in Gaza City and surrounding areas have called for an end to Hamas\u2019 rule, with some protesters shouting, \"Hamas out!\" Abusada noted that these protests, originally anti-war and anti-Israel, have taken on anti-Hamas slogans. However, Hamas has responded violently. \"Hamas has made it clear that dissent will be crushed,\" he said, adding that some protesters have been tortured to death for their involvement.",

      "\"The amount of hatred Gazans have has increased a thousandfold since October 7,\" said Milstein, \"and it\u2019s all directed toward Israel and Hamas, both regarded as evil.\"",
      "Milstein said that while protests show unrest, they lack leadership and organization. \"Hamas has violently suppressed protests, and if this continues, they may die out,\" he said, pointing to a recent protest in Beit Lahiya that quickly dwindled.",

This is part of Israel Katz\u2019s Ministry of Defense plan to encourage those who wish to permanently relocate, aligning with President Trump\u2019s vision for the relocation of Gazans.",
      "\"The destruction of homes, schools, and hospitals, along with a lack of basic needs, has driven many to leave Gaza,\" Abusada said. \"But options are limited\u2014Europe is not open to large numbers of refugees from Gaza.\"",

    "summary": "Senate Democrats say allowing a GOP funding bill to pass has allowed the party to keep their focus on Trump as his tariffs have roiled the global economy.",
    "story": [
      "When a group of Senate Democrats helped pass a government funding bill in March, it caused a major fissure within the party, with the base itching to fight the Trump administration even if it came at the cost of a shutdown.",
      "But just over a month later, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policy has resulted in historic swings in the stock market and levels of economic uncertainty that are now landing squarely on his shoulders. And the Democrats who were criticized for keeping the government open are now feeling vindicated.",
      "\u201cI was right,\u201d Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, who caucuses with Democrats, told NBC News of his vote to keep the government open.",
      "\u201cI concluded, along with others, that a shutdown would actually further empower Trump and Musk to pursue what they\u2019re doing,\u201d King said. \u201cWe would have handed him a gift. Anything bad that happened to the economy would have been blamed on us.\u201d",
      "The 10 Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans to advance a six-month funding bill largely did so because of the uncertainty a government shutdown would bring, particularly in the face of the sweeping cuts being implemented by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Many Democrats feared that those federal workers who were sidelined during the lapse in funding would be targeted for firings as soon as the government was reopened, or that the reopening would be done in a piecemeal fashion, creating a chaotic and painful fight in Congress over which programs needed to be reinstated and which could wait.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d be deciding what we\u2019re going to do with the shutdown or how we\u2019re going to handle that,\u201d Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., told NBC News of what would have happened if they voted to block the funding bill.",
      "\u201cThe main reason why I felt very strongly that we wouldn\u2019t have a shutdown is that by having a shutdown you basically ceded power to the president,\u201d he said.",
      "Deep Democratic divisions",
      "Many of the Democrats who voted to avert a shutdown faced an outspoken group of activists, voters and fellow lawmakers who saw the funding bill as one of their only points of leverage. While Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress, funding legislation still requires 60 votes in the Senate, giving Democrats the ability to block bills in protest.",
      "\u201cI got my ass kicked in,\u201d Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., told NBC News. \u201cHow would that look right now, if the government would be on fire and closed for a month because of what we would have done?\u201d",
      "\u201cWe would be owning that,\u201d Fetterman said.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., added, \u201cI think the decision vindicated itself.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut I think it does point out one of the reasons that I explained to people who asked me about it was that if the economy went south, that the president would blame the Democrats, and that was not in anybody\u2019s interest,\u201d she said.",
      "But Democrats who voted to block the funding bill say they still feel their strategy was the right one.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we should have supported that [continuing resolution], and I don\u2019t think we should support a CR in the future unless it commits the administration to following the law,\u201d Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told NBC News. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can vote to give them continued free rein to do that.\u201d",
      "Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who voted against the funding bill, said he found the vote to be particularly vexing, telling NBC News: \u201cThat was one of those votes where I voted the way I thought was the right vote, but I couldn\u2019t tell you with certainty that I was confident I was right.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought it was a very risky vote either way,\u201d Welch said. \u201cOur base, and rightly so, was demanding that we fight, and that was a moment where we had some leverage. On the other hand, the Schumer concern about what happened to the shutdown that Musk wanted was legitimate. There could have been an immense amount of additional damage.\u201d",
      "And Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who was an outspoken advocate for blocking the GOP funding bill, expressed a desire to move on.",
      "\u201cThis is not about the rearview mirror. Nobody wants to relitigate what happened. It\u2019s about what we\u2019re going to do going forward,\u201d Warren told NBC News. \u201cDonald Trump has proven himself to be an even bigger threat to the American economy and to the worldwide economy than anyone had predicted.\u201d",
      "The leader in the middle",
      "No Democrat took more heat for voting to advance the GOP funding bill than Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who faced calls to step down as the party\u2019s leader in the chamber.",

      "\u201cI think I made the right decision,\u201d Schumer told NBC News in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re all united in looking forward, because they have shown how incompetent they are in just about every issue.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "MIAMI \u2014 After Florida International University\u2019s police department entered into an agreement with the federal government to carry out immigration enforcement on campus, some students say they are terrified.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary and nerve-racking,\u201d said an undergraduate at the university.",
      "The student, who's not being identified because he lacks legal immigration status, told NBC News he came to the U.S. when he was 5 with his family after they were threatened by gangs in their native El Salvador. He said he was very focused in middle school and high school and took many Advanced Placement classes, knowing he had to work harder to have a shot at college.",
      "Now, the student is not sure if he'll continue at FIU next year. For now, he said he\u2019s avoiding certain parts of the university he considers risky. \u201cI've been trying to not go to the main areas of campus where police are,\u201d the student said.",
      "FIU is one of a number of universities in Florida that have signed agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the 287(g) program, which trains local law enforcement officers to interrogate immigrants and detain them for potential deportation.",
      "In addition to FIU, the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida State University in Tallahassee, the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, and the University of South Florida in Tampa have in place agreements with ICE.",
      "Florida is the state with the most local agencies signing 287(g) agreements, including all of Florida\u2019s 67 county sheriffs. Dozens of cities have signed on, including some with large immigrant populations like Hialeah, Miami Springs and West Miami.",
      "It's part of Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' sweeping immigration measures, which are aligned with President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to carry out the largest deportation effort in U.S. history.",
      "\u201cFlorida is setting the example for states in combating illegal immigration and working with the Trump administration to restore the rule of law,\u201d\u00a0DeSantis said in February about the agreements with ICE.\u00a0\u201cBy allowing our state agents and law enforcement officers to be trained and approved by ICE, Florida will now have more enforcement personnel deputized to assist federal partners. That means deportations can be carried out more efficiently, making our communities safer as illegal aliens are removed.\u201d",
      "At FIU, where over 63% of the student population is Hispanic or Latino, the cooperation has alarmed many. Early in the week, many FIU students on campus seemed unaware of the new collaboration with ICE, but among those at risk of deportation, the fear is palpable.",
      "Faculty and students have mobilized and held protests against FIU\u2019s decision to collaborate with ICE. At a protest Tuesday, students held a banner that read \u201cNo ICE @FIU.\u201d",
      "In an emailed statement, FIU said their police department \u201chas signed a cooperation agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in compliance with Governor Ron DeSantis\u2019 directive to law enforcement agencies.\u201d",
      "ICE did not immediately respond to a request to comment.",
      "On Friday at a faculty senate session, professors issued a resolution asking FIU President Jeanette Nu\u00f1ez and the campus police chief to withdraw from the agreement with ICE. Nu\u00f1ez was DeSantis' former lieutenant governor who became FIU\u2019s acting president in February, following a board vote requested by the governor.",
      "\u2018I try to act normal\u2019",
      "After nearly four years as an undergraduate at FIU, a student said he was looking over his shoulder.",
      "The student requested anonymity because he lacks legal immigration status. He came with his parents from Central America when he was 9.",
      "\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m being persecuted even though I haven\u2019t done anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel more anxious. I don\u2019t know why but I see more police on campus recently. I try to act normal and dress nice.\u201d",
      "The student said that when he and other undocumented students found out about the collaboration, \u201ceveryone was scared. People cried. Everyone feels it\u2019s unfair.\u201d",
      "One FIU professor described the atmosphere as \"reminiscent\" of Latin American universities and what it was like in the Soviet Union. The professor's name is being withheld because they're not authorized to speak in areas outside their expertise.",
      "\u201cThis is how it used to be in Latin America. The government would look into the university to make sure that you were towing the line,\u201d the professor said. \u201cWe\u2019re going in that direction now.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe campus police is here to protect students from crime. They are not supposed to enforce the policy of the federal government. Immigration policy is federal policy,\u201d the professor said.",
      "The cooperation with ICE comes as the Trump administration has cracked down on some foreign students, revoking their visas and ordering them to leave the country immediately. At least 36 students in Florida have been stripped of their visas, 18 at FIU.",
      "The administration's actions are a stark departure from the policy set in place over a decade ago that restricted federal immigration agencies from carrying out immigration enforcement in sensitive locations like schools and churches. The Trump administration ended that guidance in January, making students on college campuses potential immigration enforcement targets.",
      "Universities in Florida have seen a number of changes under DeSantis. Teaching critical race theory has been banned; centers to promote center-right ideas have been created; a recent law limits the content taught at public universities; and multiple faculty members have been terminated after the state adopted post-tenure reviews of professors.",
      "The Dream.US, an organization that awards college scholarships to  \"Dreamers\" \u2014  young adults who've been in the U.S. since they were very young but lack legal immigration status \u2014 announced it's withdrawing scholarships for hundreds of students in eight Florida universities. Gaby Pacheco, president of Dream.US, cited Florida's  decision to end in-state tuition for students without legal immigration status \u2014 which takes effect in July \u2014\u00a0as well as the universities' 286(g) agreements with ICE. \u201cWe do not feel our students will be safe on campus,\" Pacheco told the Miami Herald.",
      "Melissa Tavara and Katerin Crespo, both theater majors at FIU, said they worried about how the campus police will carry out their new duties as they walked across campus on a recent afternoon. Both are U.S. citizens but worry about racial profiling.",
      "\u201cHow else would you look for these students,\u201d said Tavara.",
      "Crespo said, \u201cThis creates fear. It\u2019s an international school. We are supposed to be a melting pot.\u201d"

      "The Oklahoma Sooners may not have an Olympic medalist on their team, but in gymnastics, stuck landings never go out of style.",
      "The Sooners won their seventh national title at the NCAA gymnastics championships in Fort Worth, Texas, on Saturday. They narrowly edged out the UCLA Bruins, helmed by Olympic gold medalist Jordan Chiles.",
      "Despite an indomitable performance from Chiles and her teammates, the Bruins claimed second place, finishing four tenths of a point behind Oklahoma. Missouri and Utah rounded out the top four.",
      "Oklahoma started their night on the balance beam, where nerves tend to creep in for even the most experienced teams. If they were jittery, it didn\u2019t show \u2014 every score the Sooners counted on the beam was a 9.900 or above.",
      "UCLA mirrored Oklahoma\u2019s early momentum, going lights-out on their best event, the floor exercise. Chiles anchored the Bruins with a near-perfect 9.975, tying Oklahoma after the first rotation.",
      "Five Olympians competed in Saturday\u2019s final, including Chiles and her 2021 Olympic teammate Grace McCallum (Utah), Team Canada\u2019s Brooklyn Moors (UCLA), Emma Malabuyo (UCLA) who represented the Philippines and Olympic bronze medalist Amelie Morgan of Great Britain (Utah).",
      "In the second and third rotations, Oklahoma accumulated a healthy buffer over the rest of the field. A hungry beam rotation from UCLA led to a tight race, but Oklahoma clinched the win with a stellar final rotation on the uneven bars.",
      "\u201cTruly a fairytale ending,\u201d Oklahoma\u2019s Jordan Bowers said on the ABC broadcast. \u201cObviously, last year was a tough loss, but you have to grow from it and we have learned so much this season \u2026 This little girl when I was 13 committed here and I dreamed of moments like these.\u201d",
      "Bowers also claimed the individual all-around title in Thursday\u2019s competition.",
      "The biggest shock of the night came in the second rotation, when McCallum fell off the balance beam. The uncharacteristic error hampered the Utes\u2019 quest to win their first national championship since 1995.",
      "Defending champion and No. 1 seed LSU failed to advance out of Thursday\u2019s semifinal, trailing UCLA and Utah. Missouri earned their first berth to the final in program history after a clutch beam routine from 5th-year Helen Hu, who also won the individual national title in that event. LSU\u2019s freshman star Kailin Chio claimed the vault title and Chiles won the uneven bars, while her teammate Brooklyn Moors took home the floor exercise title.",
      "Chiles became the first Bruin to win two uneven bars national titles. Her Olympic teammate Jade Carey (Oregon State) was close to tying Bowers for the all-around title, but an imperfect landing on the vault kept her in fourth place.",
      "This year\u2019s field offered one of the closest match-ups in recent years, with LSU missing the final four by two tenths of a point \u2014 a stuck landing away from advancing."

      "It\u2019s spring skywatching at its best: The annual Lyrid meteor shower is back, offering people across the Northern Hemisphere a chance to catch shooting stars in the night sky.",
      "The meteor shower began on April 16, but will reach its peak Monday night and into the early-morning hours of Tuesday. Weather permitting, skywatchers could see up to 15 shooting stars per hour during that period, as long as they\u2019re in a dark location.",
      "The Lyrids are typically one of the year\u2019s most reliable meteor showers, and their timing coincides with more temperate spring temperatures across the Northern Hemisphere, making them a popular celestial show.",
      "This year\u2019s peak occurs with a waning crescent moon that will be about 27% full, according to NASA, which means the shooting stars are less likely to be washed out by bright moonlight.",
      "In order to best enjoy the peak, NASA recommends watching outside from Monday night anytime after 10 p.m. local time until dawn the next morning, with a sweet spot at roughly 5 a.m. local time on Tuesday. But anytime late in the evening on Monday and before the moon rises overnight at around 3:30 a.m. local time should offer good chances to see meteors streaking across the night sky.",
      "The Lyrids are usually observed most clearly from the Northern Hemisphere, but eagle-eyed skywatchers in the Southern Hemisphere may be able to spot some shooting stars, according to NASA.",
      "If conditions are clear, it\u2019s best to pick an unobstructed viewing location under the darkest possible skies, away from city lights and other forms of light pollution.",
      "Skywatchers should face roughly toward the east and look straight ahead. Meteors can streak from any point and the Lyrids are known to occasionally leave bright trails as they dart across the night sky.",
      "Meteor showers can be enjoyed without any special equipment, but experts suggest giving your eyes time to adjust to the dark, spending about 45 minutes without looking at cellphones or any bright points of light.",
      "Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through bits of debris left over from comets or asteroids. As our planet orbits the sun and swings through these clouds of rocks and dust, the pieces vaporize in the atmosphere and appear as streaks of light in the sky.",
      "The Lyrids are caused by debris from a comet known as C/1861 G1, or Comet Thatcher, named for the amateur astronomer Alfred E. Thatcher, who first observed the comet in 1861.",
      "After its peak, the Lyrid meteor shower will continue to be on display until April 29."

Morales Sr. was portrayed in the Netflix series \"Griselda,\" inspired by the true story of Colombian drug trafficker Griselda Blanco, starring Sof\u00eda Vergara.",

      "\"He'd been doing dialysis three days a week to survive, to stay alive, fighting to stay alive for his family, and waiting for that next kidney that was hopefully going to come,\" Ricardo said. \"And then this happens.\"",

      "As Trump revealed China would face some of the highest tariffs in his country-by-country \u201cLiberation Day\u201d rollout of the levies \u2014 and later said the duties on China would rise as high as 145% \u2014 shares in Hasbro and Mattel have tanked. While both firms had earlier incorporated a 20% tariff impact from China into their financial projections for 2025, they have not yet publicly discussed the impact of a 145% levy.",
      "It\u2019s one reason why the Toy Association is co-sponsoring this year\u2019s White House Easter Egg Roll \u2014 part of a push to keep toys, which have traditionally avoided trade duties, free from Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe Administration maintains regular contact with business leaders, industry groups, and everyday Americans about our trade and economic policies. President Trump, however, has been clear: if you\u2019re worried about tariffs, the solution is simple. Make your product in America,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "That\u2019s not so easy, toy industry officials say. Chinese toy manufacturing expertise has been honed through decades of experience, and the U.S. industry\u2019s supply chain has become dependent on molds, dyes, labor and safety techniques that are uniquely found there.",
      "\u201cThis is skilled labor, and there\u2019s no getting around that,\u201d Ahearn said. \u201cAnd they are significantly less expensive and more experienced than it ever can be in U.S., he added, referring to China\u2019s toy supply chain.\u201d",
      "It would be virtually impossible to replicate the industry\u2019s efficiencies in the U.S. in a reasonable time frame, he said.",
      "Jonathan Silva, co-owner of the Massachusetts-based WS Game Company, said he fears he will have to lay off his 22 employees if the situation drags on. His firm designs high-end versions of classic games and 100% of their manufacturing occurs in China, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at standstill,\u201d Silva said. He estimates they have about four months of product runway built up,\u00a0but after that it\u2019s up in the air.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re investigating every option we can, but right now our business is pretty much on hold,\u201d he said.",
      "Even firms that don\u2019t rely on China say Trump\u2019s tariffs are having a ripple effect. Beate Caso, head of Bruder Toys America, which manufactures its product in Germany, says that in addition to having to reckon with 10% tariffs there, the entire industry will face higher costs due to worldwide shipping container shortages as production in China for all products slows down.",
      "\u201cPrices will go up tremendously,\u201d Caso said. \u201cThere will also be limited supply, and then you have to add tariff costs. So everything is just going to become more expensive, and consumers will definitely feel that.\u201d"

Others said they wouldn\u2019t be able to concentrate for fear of another shooting happening just as they returned.",

      "Phoenix Ikner, 20, an FSU student and stepson of a sheriff\u2019s deputy, is currently hospitalized and in custody in connection with the shooting that killed two staff members and injured six.",
      "Freshman Elizabeth Palmer said that every day she walks past the Oglesby Student Union \u2014 where the gunman opened fire on students and staff \u2014 and can\u2019t imagine having being forced to walk by it again.",
      "\u201cEven though most of us weren\u2019t physically at the scene, we all saw it,\u201d Palmer said. \u201cI can\u2019t walk past the exact area where I saw a girl laying in a pool of blood. It\u2019s traumatizing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think what\u2019s causing students the most stress is the fact that everything is up in the air right now and we don\u2019t know what to do with ourselves,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Senior Jack Campi, faced with the original news that he was expected to return to campus on Monday, was in disbelief. Now he\u2019s waiting to hear from his professors about how they plan on handling final exams with the latest guidance from the university\u2019s president.",
      "\u201cEight people went [to FSU] and it was a normal day, just like Monday might be a normal day. And they didn\u2019t come home. [For] two that was their last day, they took their last breaths.\u201d",

      "Attendees of the protest, which took place at Lafayette Square Park in Washington, D.C., told NBC News that the treatment of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the Trump administration says was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, was among the issues that led them to participate in the demonstration.",
      "\u201cEveryone should have due process. No one should be just taken away and locked up. I don\u2019t care if he is a murderer, he still should get due process,\u201d protester Susie Stern of Ohio said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this country is based on. Laws.\u201d",

Missouri earned their first berth to the final in program history after a clutch beam routine from 5th-year Helen Hu, who also won the individual national title in that event. LSU\u2019s freshman star Kailin Chio claimed the vault title and Chiles won the uneven bars, while her teammate Brooklyn Moors took home the floor exercise title.",

It said 1,975 international rescuers and medical workers from 25 countries had collaborated with local rescuers in saving 653 people and recovering 753 bodies from under rubble.",
      "Myanma Alinn said 65,096 houses and buildings, 2,514 schools, 4,317 Buddhist monasterial living quarters, 6,027 pagodas and temples, 350 hospitals and clinics, 170 bridges, 586 dams and 203 sections of the country\u2019s main highway were damaged by the earthquake.",
      "Myanmar Fire Services Department, an official emergency services agency operating in many areas of the country, said in statements posted Friday on its Facebook page that rescue workers were carrying out relief, search and cleaning debris from the big buildings, and had returned valuable jewelry, cash, and documents found among the rubble to their owners.",
      "It also said that rescuers recovered two bodies from collapsed buildings in Mandalay.",
      "An official from Myanmar Rescue Federation (Mandalay), which has been operating along with the firefighters, told The Associated Press on Friday that the priority three weeks on from the earthquake was to clear bodies and debris from under bigger buildings, while also providing assistance to the survivors affected by the earthquake.",
      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears arrest for speaking without authorization, said the number of bodies recovered daily has decreased to only one or two.",
      "Another emergency services worker in Mandalay, similarly speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of\u00a0rescue teams operating in Mandalay has been steadily decreasing\u00a0as most of the international rescue teams had returned to their countries after their work to find survivors was considered completed. He said local rescue workers were mainly participating in clearing debris and providing assistance.",
      "The United Nations Development Program earlier this month estimated that at least 2.5 million tons, or roughly 125,000 truckloads, of debris from the quake needs to be removed. It based its estimate on remote sensing analysis of images obtained by satellites.",
      "UN-Habitat, the U.N. agency for human settlements, said in a statement on Friday that its staff and the Myanmar Engineering Society were collaborating in assessing widespread building damage in earthquake-affected regions.",
      "In Naypyitaw, almost all rescuers have ceased their relief efforts, while government buildings that were damaged by the earthquake have not yet been repaired and remain in their post-earthquake condition, said a resident who asked not to be named for security reasons. In residential areas, people have almost completed clearing the debris on their own.",
      "Saturday\u2019s report in Myanma Alinn said Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, head of the military government, told his Cabinet members during a meeting on Friday that the urban layout of Naypyitaw will be redesigned.",
      "Naypyitaw became Myanmar\u2019s capital in 2006 after being built at great expense almost from scratch next to what had once been a logging center inhabited by largely by farmers. It is notable for its grandiose government buildings and under-utilized multi-lane roads."

    "story": [
      "In a video, Mahmoud Ajjour is beaming as he skips into the breeze. He breaks into laughter as he watches his kite flutter in the sky, pulling it along with a string tied around his waist, in a moment that captured the irrepressible joy of childhood.",
      "At 9 years old, Mahmoud has known more trauma than most will see in a lifetime. On Dec. 6, 2023, the fourth grader was hit by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, a blast that severed one of his arms and left the other so badly damaged it had to be amputated. On Thursday, an image of Mahmoud, taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf for The New York Times, was named World Press Photo of the Year, a haunting portrait of the impact of the war on children.",
      "Mahmoud now lives in Doha, Qatar, with his family, after becoming one of a very small number of Palestinians to be evacuated from Gaza for urgent medical treatment.",
      "When Mahmoud smiles, his happiness seems infectious, but some days are harder than others. \u201cThere are bad moments for him,\u201d his mother, Nour Ajjour, 36, told NBC News by phone from Doha, Qatar\u2019s capital. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to play or go outside.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe keep him busy and have fun with him,\u201d Ajjour said. She sent videos of him gleefully speeding down a hallway on an electric bike, steering with his feet on the handlebars, and using his feet to play with a lump of bright-green clay.",
      "For now, Ajjour said, there\u2019s not much Mahmoud can do on his own, and he\u2019s impatient for prostheses, asking when he can have them so he can drink water on his own or help his family.",
      "\u201cHe likes to help a lot, and I let him help me and carry things on his shoulder,\u201d Ajjour said.",
      "Doctors at Doha\u2019s Hamad Limb Hospital are currently fitting him for protheses, and in another video, he smiles brightly as he tries on a pair of prosthetic arms.",
      "In Gaza, such treatment isn\u2019t possible, and\u00a0Mahmoud is one of at least 1,000 children in the enclave to have lost at least one limb during the war, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Many of the children, like many adults, underwent surgery without anesthesia as the health care system buckled under Israel\u2019s siege.",
      "\u201cThe first few days were very difficult,\u201d Ajjour said. Both of his hands were gone, and without anesthetic, Mahmoud was in both physical and existential pain.",
      "\u201cHe would look at his hands and not see them,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe would scream and say, \u2018Where are my hands,\u2019 and the first thing he said was, \u2018How will I hug you, how will I pray?\u2019\u201d",
      "These days, Mahmoud is learning how to type on a computer, write and use a phone with his feet. Ajjour said he dreams of going to university and becoming a journalist so he can tell the stories of Gaza\u2019s children."

    "story": [
      "TEHRAN\u00a0\u2014\u00a0A second round of high-stakes talks between the United States and Iran concluded Saturday in Rome with \"very good progress,\" a senior official in President Donald Trump's administration said.",
      "Talks will continue next week, the official said in a statement.",
      "\u201cToday, in Rome over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,\" the official said. \"We agreed to meet again next week and are grateful to our Omani partners for facilitating these talks and to our Italian partners for hosting us today.\u201d",
      "Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi both arrived late Saturday morning for the negotiations at the Omani Embassy in Rome. The talks took place as both sides sought to ease growing tensions over potential military action and Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.",
      "At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue a nuclear weapon.",
      "Following the talks, Araghchi told Iranian state television they were \"held in a constructive atmosphere\" and \"moving forward.\"",
      "\"There is no reason for too much optimism, we cannot say that we are really optimistic,\" he told the outlet. \"We must be very cautious, but there is no reason for much pessimism either.\"",
      "In a statement, Oman\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Witkoff and Araghchi agreed to enter the next phase of discussions \u201cthat aim to seal a fair, enduring and binding deal.\u201d The statement said the deal will ensure Iran is free of nuclear weapons and lift sanctions against the country while continuing to allow it \u201cto develop peaceful nuclear energy.\u201d",
      "The next round of discussions will take place in Oman\u2019s capital, Muscat, \u201cin the next few days,\u201d according to the country\u2019s foreign ministry.",
      "The talks were mediated by Oman, which also hosted a first round of negotiations between the two men in Muscat last Saturday. That paved the way for another meeting as both countries move toward cautious diplomacy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,\u201d Trump said Friday. \u201cI want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.\u201d",
      "The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Trump had privately waved off Israeli proposals to strike Iranian nuclear sites, preferring instead to pursue a renegotiated deal.",
      "Last week, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement that actions taken during the first stage of talks in Oman were \u201cgood,\u201d and must be \u201cpursued carefully.\u201d",
      "The talks represent a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution overthrew a U.S.-backed regime,\u00a0and a U.S. embassy hostage crisis that same year.",
      "Since then, the U.S. has imposed rounds of crippling economic sanctions on Iran. In 2018, during Trump\u2019s first term, he unilaterally withdrew from an accord Iran had struck with world leaders that had drastically limited Tehran\u2019s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "The heart of the current talks remains Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment, a key indicator of how close a country may be to developing a nuclear weapon.",
      "Under the 2015 nuclear accord, Iran agreed to cap enrichment at 3.67%, far below the 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. The limit was intended to ensure the program remained civilian in nature. Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the deal offered Iran billions in sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear ambitions.",
      "The deal was signed by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \u2014 the U.S., Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom \u2014 as well as Germany and the European Union.",
      "But that agreement began to unravel in 2018 when Trump pulled the U.S. out, calling it \u201cthe worst deal ever.\u201d His first administration imposed sweeping sanctions that choked Iran\u2019s economy and isolated its financial and energy sectors.",
      "In turn, Iran rolled back its limits and\u00a0 is believed to have enriched uranium up to 60%, closer to the weapons-grade level of 90%.",
      "Araghchi and Witkoff met in Oman last Saturday in talks both sides described as positive and constructive, though Iran has said since that it has been confused over the mixed messaging by the Trump administration on whether it wants Iran to completely dismantle its entire nuclear program.",
      "Last week, Witkoff posted on X that Iran must \u201cstop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.\u201d",
      "The previous day, on Fox News, the special envoy had stated that \u201cthe conversation with the Iranians\u201d would focus on limiting uranium enrichment at 3.67 % for civil nuclear purposes.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s apparent contradiction underscores the tensions that have surrounded the current talks, clouded also by lingering suspicion of Trump following the collapse of the JCPOA in 2018. Tehran remains deeply wary.",
      "Further signs of a potential shift emerged during a Friday prayer service in Tehran attended by hardline clerics and military figures, the message from the imam was revealing \u2014 Iran should remain open to negotiations.",
      "As some in the crowd of thousands at the University of Tehran campus chanted \u201cdeath to America,\u201d and the imam warned that talks should be pursued with caution, and that the U.S. and the Trump administration had shown they could not be trusted.",
      "Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if no agreement is reached. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s talks, the U.S. moved a second aircraft carrier into regional waters. The president also threatened to extend tariffs on nations that continue buying Iranian oil, atop the litany of sanctions already in force."

NBC Dallas-Fort Worth reported a vortex moving late Saturday near Weatherford. It showed signs of well-developed tornadic circulation, said the station\u2019s chief meteorologist, Rick Mitchell.",
      "\"There does not appear to be any significant storm damage within the city limits,\" but that could change under daylight, Weatherford spokesperson Amy Borders said.",
      "The federal storm prediction center said that three supercells, which can produce powerful tornadoes, were reported in North Texas.",
      "The supercells, defined by a deep updraft and well-organized, circular motion known to spawn tornadoes and potent thunderstorms, were poised to merge with a boundary between cold air and warm that could result in a \"brief uptick in tornado potential\" overnight, the federal Storm Prediction Center said.",
      "\"Severe gusts will also be a concern,\" the center said.",
      "Late Saturday, the weather service also issued a tornado watch, which advises that conditions exist for tornadoes, for a diagonal area from greater Dallas-Fort Worth to the southwest to a portion of Oklahoma under Tulsa moving northeast and as far as Fayetteville, Arkansas, through 7 a.m. Sunday.",
      "Around 24 million people were at risk from Texas to Ohio on Saturday, including in Dallas, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh. The main threats Saturday were large hail, damaging winds and a few tornadoes. Storms Saturday night in the Ohio Valley and Interior Northeast were expected to be capable of producing localized 60 mph wind gusts and quarter-sized hail.",
      "The \u201cnearly stationary\u201d spring weather system brought multiple tornado watches and  warnings to North Central Texas and southern Oklahoma on Saturday evening, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "The system, a clash of cool and warm air that\u2019s headed for northern Missouri and the Upper Great Lakes, is already blamed for more than 70 reports of baseball-sized hail in southern Wisconsin.",
      "In social media imagery verified by NBC News, a vortex was also seen in the sky in Southwest Iowa on Friday. The weather service usually doesn't confirm tornadoes until the next day, when trained spotters fan out to survey possible tracks and damage.",
      "A long line of showers and thunderstorms was continuing overnight in the region stretching from Texas to the Northeast. There is an enhanced risk of storms over parts of West Texas, including Abilene and San Angelo, where the risk is highest for very large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes.",
      "Storms will be capable of producing golf ball-sized hail, 2 to 3 inches of rain, 70 mph wind gusts and possible tornadoes were predicted as a possibility for the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.",
      "Travel disruptions started Saturday morning at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, with 52 cancelations and 531 delays, according to FlightAware.com.",
      "More than 13,000 utility customers in Texas were without power late Saturday, according to PowerOutage.us.",
      "Around 11 million people are under Flood Alerts through Sunday from Texas to Illinois, including St Louis, Missouri; Springfield, Ohio; Tulsa and Oklahoma City.  Storm totals ranging from 3 to 5 inches, with up to 7 inches were possible in some areas.",
      "On Easter Sunday, 11 million people are at risk for thunderstorms from east Texas to Illinois, including in St. Louis; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Shreveport, Louisiana. Tornado activity is possible, with the greatest risk for tornadoes and damaging winds over Missouri and into western Illinois.",
      "This weather pattern will also create a divide well above and well below average temperatures through the weekend. Highs in the Rockies, Plains and Southwest will drop 10 to 30 degrees below average, with temperatures maxing out in the 40s to 70s.",
      "Meanwhile, from the South to the Northeast, highs will soar 10 to 20 degrees above average, with temperatures maxing out in the 70s to 90s. A few record highs will be threatened this afternoon in Tampa, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Nashville, Tennessee; and Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "Highs will stay about 10 to 15 degrees above average across the Southeast through Sunday and into early next week."

      "Michael B. Jordan and director Ryan Coogler have collaborated on multiple blockbusters and critically-acclaimed films for over a decade. But for their latest project, supernatural thriller \u201cSinners,\u201d the actor takes on a challenge he has never encountered before in their history of working together: playing twins.",
      "In Coogler\u2019s horror epic, which is set in 1930s Mississippi, Jordan leads an impressive cast, including stars like Wunmi Mosaku\u00a0and Hailee Steinfeld, as he portrays twins Smoke and Stack. \u201cSinners\u201d shows Jordan's twins make a mysterious and unexpected return to their roots after spending time in Chicago among local gangsters. The powerful brothers have a reputation that precedes them, invoking feelings of fear, admiration and love in each character they encounter.",
      "While Smoke, who mostly wears shades of blue in the flick, has a cutthroat attitude and a hardness to him, Stack, donning suits with red accessories and gold in his teeth, is slightly more playful and trusting.",
      "To make each twin come alive on screen, the actor had to film scenes multiple times as he transformed into each brother between takes. Jordan tells TODAY.com what he did to prepare for the double role and how he was able to develop each character, which had subtle but impactful differences.",
      "\u201cRyan had these two brothers, the twins Noah and Logan Miller, and they were like twin consultants,\u201d he shares. \u201cSo I got an opportunity to talk with them about their experiences growing up as twins and the psychology behind it.\u201d",
      "He said the Millers helped him get into the mindset he needed to convincingly play twins with an unbreakable bond.",
      "\u201cThey walked me through, like, a twin meditation, that got into just the psyche of them and that bond and that connection,\u201d Jordan continues.",
      "With the Millers' insight, the actor then worked to form Smoke and Stack\u2019s separate identities. For both brothers, the 38-year-old star used a southern twang. Jordan explains to TODAY.com how he was able to refine the accent.",
      "The \u201cCreed\u201d star said he worked with a \u201cdialect coach, who helped break down the more physical element of them all, of how they walked, and talked, and their mannerisms and all sorts of things that you guys get a chance to see on the screen.\u201d",
      "Jordan also credits Coogler\u2019s script \u2014 which includes moments where Smoke and Stack reveal hints about their dark past \u2014 for assisting him in perfecting the characters. Additionally, there are scenes with Steinfeld\u2019s character Mary and Mosaku\u2019s character Annie that inform the audience how Smoke and Stack have changed since they were last in town.",
      "Mary has a complicated history with Stack and in the multiple scenes viewers can almost feel the palpable tension and resentment that lingers between them. Meanwhile, Smoke and Annie\u2019s relationship reveals their tragic backstory and the pain he hides.",
      "Steinfeld and Mosaku opened up to TODAY.com about filming scenes with each twin. They reveal that the type of music playing on set changed depending on if Jordan was portraying Stack or Smoke in a scene.",
      "\u201cThere was definitely a song that we played, Michael and I, around some of our scenes,\" Mosaku says. \"We played Sade\u2019s \u2018By Your Side.\u2019 That\u2019s a song that we used to get into a moment together.\u201d",
      "Steinfeld, meanwhile, reveals that the song played during some of their scenes had a much different vibe.",
      "\u201cThere was one particular song that I had on repeat\u2026There were a couple scenes in particular with Stack (where) \u2018Ex-factor\u2019 (by) Lauryn Hill (was playing).\"",
      "\u201cSometimes I would just read the lyrics, and it felt like if Mary were to write a song to Stack,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cSinners,\u201d also starring Delroy Lindo, Jack O\u2019Connell, Jayme Lawson, Omar Benson Miller, Li Jun Li and newcomer Miles Caton, is now playing in theaters nationwide."

      "A TikTok by social worker Rachel LaPointe explains what would have happened in real life.",
      "\u201cIn the vast majority of states, it's only the suspicion of child abuse that kickstarts your mandate to report,\" LaPointe explains. \"A parent saying they believe this is going on inside of their home is absolutely enough suspicion to qualify.\"",
      "Bambi Fisher, director of Women and Children\u2019s Health in the Department of Social Work Services at Mount Sinai Kravis Children\u2019s Hospital, agrees. She tells TODAY.com that this portrayal is \"absolutely incorrect\" if the daughter is a minor. (The show doesn't state how old she is, but the actor who plays her is currently 17.)",
      "\"I think any social worker who's been trained by child protection protocols would disagree\" with \"The Pitt's\" portrayal, Fisher says. \"The mandate is suspicion of abuse and neglect, and we 100% are not investigators.\"",
      "Instead, Fisher says that a hospital social worker's responsibility is to file a report to Child Protection Services if there is any abuse suspicion. CPS then has the option of \"accepting or not accepting a report.\" If accepted \u2014\u00a0which Fisher believes this case would be \u2014 it would then be investigated by CPS, not the mandatory reporter.",
      "\"If a parent came to us and said exactly what (the mom) said ... those are all big red flags,\" Fisher adds.",
      "The mandated reporting process depends on the state but usually involves calling the mandated reporter number, explaining the circumstances and then sharing where the child lives, their age and if there are any other siblings in the home.",
      "\"It's a very scripted form,\" Fisher explains.",
      "In the episode, instead of reporting the abuse suspicions, Robinavitch and Kiara recommend Susan speak with someone about her feelings and talk to Alana, and they offer to connect her with law enforcement.",
      "\"Hopefully now that it's out in the open, she'll take the necessary steps to handle this the right way,\" Robinavitch tells Santos.",
      "While Fisher says the recommendation to have the mom speak to someone is \"very helpful,\" she reiterates that with kids under 18, the protocol isn't allowing the family to decide whether to contact law enforcement. It's reporting the suspected abuse to CPS.",
      "\"The Pitt\" wraps up this arc with Santos confronting Silas while he's still in his hospital bed. She delivers a monologue where she calls him \"child molester\" and threatens to involve the police and kill him if he doesn't stop touching his daughter.",
      "It's a powerful scene, but this moment in particular concerned LaPointe.",
      "\"If you are ever in a comparable situation, do not do that,\" she says in the TikTok. \"That is actually an incredibly dangerous thing to do, as that man was about to go home with his wife and daughter without any real discussion of safety plans or what happens next. 'The Pitt' created a scenario where this daughter is actually in far more danger when she goes home because of the actions of the doctors.\"",
      "\"Maybe that's the point, but they never acknowledged it as wrong, and they never brought it back up again,\" LaPoint continues. \"At the end of the day, that's never how people who are trained in trauma-informed care would've handled that.\"",
      "Fisher adds that if the mandated reporting had been done correctly, Alana \"wouldn\u2019t necessarily be allowed to go home without Child Protection saying the child\u2019s safe to go home.\u201d",
      "Despite its mischaracterization of mandatory reporting in Episode 7, both Fisher and LaPointe are still big fans of \"The Pitt.\"",
      "LaPointe even starts her TikTok saying how she's \"obsessed\" with the show and that the only reason she's posting the feedback is that Wyle has said he wants the show to be as accurate as possible.",
      "Fisher agrees. \"Even if there were issues with Episode 7 ... the portrayal of the social worker as critical to the whole team was very positive,\" she says."

Frightened as his son stumbles toward him with a broken guitar, the preacher asks Sammie to reject his love of music, for good.",

      "What happens at the end of \u2018Sinners\u2019?",
      "After introducing characters like Smoke, Stack and Sammie in the first few minutes, \u201cSinners\u201d shows them preparing to open a juke joint in an old mill the twins purchased from a deceitful and racist landowner. As the sun sets, patrons, including Mary (Steinfeld) and Pearline (Lawson), arrive for the establishment\u2019s grand opening while others, such as Cornbread (Miller), Grace (Li), Delta Slim (Lindo) and Annie (Mosaku), are already there to help Smoke and Stack pull off a successful night.",

      "Each time a character leaves the juke joint, they return changed and suddenly need approval to re-enter. Sensing an otherworldly presence, Annie quickly realizes that Remmick is a vampire who bites and creates more blood-thirsty creatures whenever a guest leaves the safety of the jukebar.",

      "Who dies in 'Sinners'?",
      "Ultimately, everyone who is bitten and turned into a vampire dies, but some of those vampires do live on, which viewers learn in a post-credits scene.",
      "Leading up to the climatic battle, Smoke, Annie, Delta Slim, Pearline, Grace and Sammie decide to think of a plan while Remmick and the other vampires await their demise. After a desperate Grace welcomes the vampires in, the others, armed with stakes and holy water, fight for their lives.",
      "Annie is bitten and Smoke stabs her in the heart, at her request, before she becomes a vampire. Pearline is also killed and Grace is burned alive trying to defend herself against a vampire who has taken over her husband\u2019s body. Delta Slim chooses to sacrifice himself to give Smoke and Sammie time to escape.",
      "Before the credits officially roll, viewers learn that Smoke and Sammie are the only humans left standing.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very heroic thing to do, but it\u2019s also a sacrifice that\u2019s necessary,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to, as I see it (and) as Delta Slim sees it, preserve the future of the music and the future of the culture, it has to be done.\u201d",

      "Who survives in 'Sinners'?",
      "As the last humans standing, Smoke and Sammie attempt to flee but vampire Stack catches them. Smoke and Stack fight and Smoke appears to get the upper hand before the scene cuts to show Sammie, who jumped out a window and injured his leg, being surrounded by Remmick and all the vampires.",
      "While Remmick tries to drown and kill Sammie, the young musician reaches for his guitar \u2014 which the twins gave to him \u2014 and smashes it into Remmick\u2019s head. The metal plate on the guitar lodges in Remmick\u2019s head and kills him as the sun rises and turns all the other vampires into ashes.",

Meanwhile, Smoke, who also survived, stays at the juke joint and waits for the man who sold him the old mill to arrive. He shoots the landowner and all the Ku Klux Klan members after previously learning from Remmick that they had planned to ambush Smoke, Stack and their friends the next morning.",
      "During the shootout, one bullet hits Smoke and he slowly dies before being greeted by an apparition of Annie and their child, who died years ago.",

      "In a second post-credits scene, the older version of Sammie sits at a bar before two familiar faces join him: Stack and Mary. It is revealed that Mary ran off and evaded the sunlight before Remmick and the others were burned years ago.",
      "Stack sits by Sammie\u2019s side and shares that he made a deal with Smoke during their fight to leave Sammie alone. Sammie tells them that he was having the best day of his life before the bloodbath. Stack agrees, pointing out that it was the last moment he felt sunshine and saw his brother.",
      "Stack and Mary then leave, leaving the door open for a potential sequel."

      "Leslie Odom Jr. visited TODAY on Monday to exclusively announce his return to Broadway\u2019s \u201cHamilton\u201d as Aaron Burr. He joked while talking to TODAY.com that he will \u201cfind all the bootleg YouTube videos\u201d of other performers in the role to inspire him this time around. He noted that when the show first came out in 2015, the cast \u201chad no perspective.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had what we were trying to make based off of the theater that we love, which is a lot. That\u2019s a fair amount. But what these performers have had since we\u2019ve left is the perspective,\u201d Odom Jr. explained. \u201cThey can see what we made. They can see the blind spots. ... They can see the things that we couldn\u2019t, and in some cases, maybe even be better than us. And so, I\u2019m stealing everything from them.\u201d",
      "Odom Jr., who recently rereleased his book, \u201cFailing Up,\u201d in paperback, is also a proud father to two kids with wife Nicolette Robinson: daughter Lucy and son Able.",

      "\u201cBut I feel like he will be in competition with his sister,\u201d Odom Jr. said. \u201cAnd so, he will not tap out. He will try to hang in as long as she hangs in.\u201d",
      "The one thing Tyra Banks\u2019 son does that she can\u2019t get enough of",
      "Tyra Banks, who was guest co-host on TODAY with Jenna & Friends this week, sat down with TODAY.com on Thursday to tell us about her ice cream business Smize & Dream, wellness and life at home with her family. (Her partner, Louis B\u00e9langer-Martin, also stopped by for a quick hello!)",
      "When asked about her 9-year-old son, York, Banks said, \u201cMy son is extremely loving. And sometimes he\u2019ll just look at me and say, [whispers] \u2018I love you.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, you\u2019re 9! How? Where is that coming from? That little micro \u2018I love you,\u2019 and just looking in my eyes or just squeezing my hand, and I\u2019m just like, wow.\u201d",

      "Bell pointed Nova to Joan of Arc, who some historians believe had epilepsy, as a figure that she could look up to.",

      "After three seasons of \u201cBosch: Legacy\u201d on Prime Video \u2014 the popular show with a strong fan base has finally come to an end.",
      "As a spinoff of \u201cBosch,\u201d which ran for seven seasons on Prime Video, \u201cBosch: Legacy\u201d was launched in 2022 and became a fan favorite in its own right. The franchise is based on author Michael Connelly\u2019s Harry Bosch novels, which follows gritty Los Angeles Police detective Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), who solves crimes while also dealing with his unresolved past.",
      "In \u201cBosch: Legacy,\u201d we see Bosch retired from the force, and now working as a private investigator. His daughter Maddie (Madison Lintz) is a LAPD patrol officer, and Season One ends with her dramatic kidnapping. In Season 2, fans see Bosch race against time to save his daughter, eventually rescuing her in the Mojave Desert. Season 2 ends with Maddie receiving a phone call from an inmate who tells that her that her kidnapper has been killed in prison, at the request of her father.",
      "So where does that leave us in Season 3? In an interview with TODAY.com, prior to the Season Three premiere, Welliver sat down with us to unpack the final season, and where Bosch's story will go from here.",
      "What happens in the final season of \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "In the final season of \u201cBosch: Legacy,\u201d Harry is seen dealing with a multitude of issues, including the suspicion of murder after an inmate calls his daughter, Maddie, to tell her that he put a hit out on her kidnapper in prison.",
      "He's also confronted with his past decisions after a solider tells Maddie that her father tortured and killed an enemy bomber during his military service in Afghanistan. Welliver tells TODAY.com that after all these \"things come to light\" a \"strain is placed\" on his and Maddie's relationship.",
      "\u201cMaddie, knowing who her father is, is deeply confused. And so what happens is that there is an investigation that is opened up. Is there any fact?\u201d Welliver asks, rhetorically. \u201cSo, Maddie has to juggle who she knows her father to be.\u201d",
      "Amid the investigations looking into his past, Bosch is also working on investigations of his own: he's trying to figure out what happened to a family that disappeared.",
      "\u201cHarry also is hired by a woman from Ireland whose entire family has gone missing, which is her daughter, son in law, and her two grandchildren. They\u2019ve just vanished into thin air,\u201d Welliver explains. \u201cAnd as Bosch navigates every case, they all become personal, but this one involves children and a family, and I would say we see Harry brought to the absolute edge, looking into the abyss in this.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Honey Chandler (Mimi Rogers) is campaigning to become district attorney and must deal with rising threats to her hopes for office.",
      "Welliver says that this season finds Bosch at the crossroads of his sense of right and wrong.",
      "\u201cWhere we find him now in this final season, there\u2019s some questions that have arisen. Has he in fact, compromised his moral compass?\u201d",
      "What happens in the final episode of \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "In the final episode of \"Bosch: Legacy,\" Bosch and Detective Renee Ballard (Maggie Q) are both working to catch the \"Flower Girls\" killer. \"I made a promise to these girls Mads, I'm going to see it through,\" he tells Maddie in the episode, when she reminds him he's retired.",
      "With Maddie's help, Bosch connects a local firehouse to the crimes, and a specific fireman named Jeremy McKee fits the bill. They get a DNA sample with the help of Maddie and her partner. At the same time, Bosch's associate Mo is breaking into the suspect's house for intel. Mo then finds the address of where the killer will strike next, and they apprehend McKee and save his would-be victim.",
      "In the final scene, Bosch and Ballard go for a walk, and have a moment where he praises her for her work. \"Maybe someday down the line we'll get to work together again,\" he says in the episode.",
      "Ballard then compliments Bosch's works, but adds says that some of the  \"darkness\" in their line of work has gotten into Harry. She tells him to \"be safe,\" and walks away.",
      "The scene ends with Harry walking off alone downtown as the camera captures the city in the background.",
      "Does Bosch die in \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "No, Harry Bosch does not die in the final episode. But Welliver says that the series ending doesn\u2019t provide much closure.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no finality in the final episode of this season. We did not have the knowledge that the show was not going to continue,\u201d he tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re left at the end of the season, in the final episode, there\u2019s always a kind of \u2014 there\u2019s always a lack of resolution to a certain degree that we leave emotionally Harry with. And I think in that regard, that remains consistent,\" Welliver says. \"But as far as there being ... any kind of genuine closure, or the audience going, 'Well, what\u2019s next?' We don\u2019t know. So with that being said, It\u2019s Hollywood \u2014 stranger things have happened.\"",
      "Will there be another season of \u2018Bosch: Legacy\u2019?",
      "While another season of \"Bosch: Legacy\" has not been confirmed, a spinoff of \"Bosch\" has been confirmed, which will follow Bosch\u2019s protege, Renee Ballard (Maggie Q). We get introduced to Ballard before the series wraps up, setting her up for her own show.",
      "\u201cBallard is also a character in Michael Connelly\u2019s books, and she and Harry cross paths, and then he becomes sort of a mentor,\u201d Welliver tells TODAY.com. \u201cHis relationship to her is almost sort of quasi-paternal. We don\u2019t get to go that deep into the relationship, but we do introduce them and connect them in a way that certainly springs off the character of Ballard, so we know who she is.\u201d",
      "As far as Welliver officially reprising his role for a new spinoff, the actor says never say never.",
      "When asked if he would go back to the role, Welliver offered a simple answer: \u201cIt\u2019s a very immediate, \u2018Yes,\u2019 he tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"Because I have such a strong connection and kinship to that, to that character. So we\u2019ll see, you never know,\u201d he adds.",
      "After the season finale, Welliver said in an interview with TV Insider, published April 17, that he would make an appearance on the Maggie Q's \"Bosch\" spinoff.",
      "\"I will just say there is some crossover, for lack of a better term,\" he said before teasing that the new series will involve Ballard being \"kicked to cold case which isn\u2019t like moving higher up on the ladder in RHD (Robbery-Homicide Division).\"",
      "Maggie Q noted that she and Bosch both \"hate injustice and there were some injustices that Ballard faced in RHD.\"",
      "\"She stood up for herself and there was consequences or that,\" she told the outlet. \"That\u2019s a very Bosch move in terms of what they will sacrifice for a greater good.\"",
      "Welliver concurred, adding that Ballard will now have to lean on people who are outside of her department for help.",
      "\"There\u2019s a lot of people in the system that she can\u2019t trust,\" he said. \"And funnily enough, the guy that she came into this not trusting is probably the most trusted person that she can rely on. And he\u2019s not even in the department.\""

It felt more real because this thing had happened.\u201d",
      "Minear also shared why it had to be Bobby who died in the dramatic episode.",
      "\"Well, I think it needed to be Bobby for a lot of reasons,\" he told Variety. \"The first reason is that it made sense. It didn\u2019t feel arbitrary, because if you track the tragic arc of his character, of where he started, and how he came to L.A. looking for atonement, it just makes a kind of tragic sense for his character in a way it wouldn\u2019t for another character.\"",

      "\u201cShe had no idea the guy who wrote that song was sitting right there. I told her and her friends and they lost their minds,\u201d Kyle captioned his video.",

      "They stumbled into the bar and her friends \u201cimmediately\u201d went straight towards the karaoke booth to pick songs, she says, while she grabbed drinks. \u201cWe were there, I don\u2019t know, 15 minutes maybe, and our song came on.\u201d",
      "Gill was the only one to go up and knew the song well enough as a Blink-182 fan. She says because she\u2019s not a singer, she likes to \u201cup\u201d the show in other ways.",
      "\u201cNinety-nine percent of the things that I do, I do for my own entertainment,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I started singing to them, and then I was like, I need to throw some screamo stuff in here. Why not?\u201d",

So I was like, I think I should probably tell them.\u201d",
      "Kyle and Gill didn\u2019t know each other, but connected after he told her that DeLonge was there and his videos of her doing karaoke went viral.",

      "After Kyle told her and her friends that DeLonge was in the bar, they ran over to him.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are threatening to put a crimp in Christmas.",
      "The United States imports as much as 75% of the toy products it sells from China, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, making it one of the industries most reliant on that country\u2019s supply chain. Along with sports equipment and games, it is the fourth-largest import category from that nation.",
      "As a result, toy industry officials are warning U.S. consumers to expect higher prices and fewer choices this year, including for the holidays, as a result of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cChristmas is in danger,\u201d said Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, the industry\u2019s principal trade group. He said production in China continues to slow every time Trump ratchets up the tariffs on that country.",
      "And it\u2019s happening at an inopportune time. Traditionally, production starts to ramp up around this point of the year for goods to be ready for the fall and winter shopping season, he said.",
      "As Trump revealed China would face some of the highest tariffs in his country-by-country \u201cLiberation Day\u201d rollout of the levies \u2014 and later said the duties on China would rise as high as 145% \u2014 shares in Hasbro and Mattel have tanked. While both firms had earlier incorporated a 20% tariff impact from China into their financial projections for 2025, they have not yet publicly discussed the impact of a 145% levy.",
      "It\u2019s one reason why the Toy Association is co-sponsoring this year\u2019s White House Easter Egg Roll \u2014 part of a push to keep toys, which have traditionally avoided trade duties, free from Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cThe Administration maintains regular contact with business leaders, industry groups, and everyday Americans about our trade and economic policies. President Trump, however, has been clear: if you\u2019re worried about tariffs, the solution is simple. Make your product in America,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.",
      "That\u2019s not so easy, toy industry officials say. Chinese toy manufacturing expertise has been honed through decades of experience, and the U.S. industry\u2019s supply chain has become dependent on molds, dyes, labor and safety techniques that are uniquely found there.",
      "\u201cThis is skilled labor, and there\u2019s no getting around that,\u201d Ahearn said. \u201cAnd they are significantly less expensive and more experienced than it ever can be in U.S., he added, referring to China\u2019s toy supply chain.\u201d",
      "It would be virtually impossible to replicate the industry\u2019s efficiencies in the U.S. in a reasonable time frame, he said.",
      "Jonathan Silva, co-owner of the Massachusetts-based WS Game Company, said he fears he will have to lay off his 22 employees if the situation drags on. His firm designs high-end versions of classic games and 100% of their manufacturing occurs in China, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at standstill,\u201d Silva said. He estimates they have about four months of product runway built up,\u00a0but after that it\u2019s up in the air.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re investigating every option we can, but right now our business is pretty much on hold,\u201d he said.",
      "Even firms that don\u2019t rely on China say Trump\u2019s tariffs are having a ripple effect. Beate Caso, head of Bruder Toys America, which manufactures its product in Germany, says that in addition to having to reckon with 10% tariffs there, the entire industry will face higher costs due to worldwide shipping container shortages as production in China for all products slows down.",
      "\u201cPrices will go up tremendously,\u201d Caso said. \u201cThere will also be limited supply, and then you have to add tariff costs. So everything is just going to become more expensive, and consumers will definitely feel that.\u201d"

      "In Gaza, such treatment isn\u2019t possible, and\u00a0Mahmoud is one of at least 1,000 children in the enclave to have lost at least one limb during the war, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund. Many of the children, like many adults, underwent surgery without anesthesia as the health care system buckled under Israel\u2019s siege.",
      "\u201cThe first few days were very difficult,\u201d Ajjour said. Both of his hands were gone, and without anesthetic, Mahmoud was in both physical and existential pain.",
      "\u201cHe would look at his hands and not see them,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother said. \u201cHe would scream and say, \u2018Where are my hands,\u2019 and the first thing he said was, \u2018How will I hug you, how will I pray?\u2019\u201d",
      "These days, Mahmoud is learning how to type on a computer, write and use a phone with his feet. Ajjour said he dreams of going to university and becoming a journalist so he can tell the stories of Gaza\u2019s children."

      "At least 11 people were killed in the southern city of Khan Younis, several of them in a tent in the Mwasi area where hundreds of thousands of displaced people are living, hospital workers said. Israel has designated it as a humanitarian zone.",
      "Four other people were killed in separate strikes in Rafah city, including a mother and her daughter, according to the European Hospital, where the bodies were brought.",
      "At the funeral in Khan Younis Saturday afternoon, families wept over the bodies of their relatives and cried out in pain. \u201cOmar is gone ... I wish it was me,\u00a8 screamed the brother of one of the victims.",

      "Trump has nonetheless threatened to bomb Iran if no deal was reached, and the U.S. moved a second aircraft carrier into Middle Eastern waters ahead of Saturday's talks.",
      "The president has also threatened to extend tariffs on other countries over buying Iranian oil, in a bid to force Tehran's hand on top of the sweeping sanctions already in place.",

    "story": [
      "A haunting portrait of a young Palestinian boy from the Gaza Strip who lost both of his arms in an Israeli strike has been named World Press Photo of the Year for 2025.",
      "Mahmoud Ajjour, 9, was fleeing an Israeli attack in Gaza with his family when he turned back to urge his loved ones to move forward, the World Press Photo organization said in a statement accompanying the picture taken by Palestinian photographer Samar Abu Elouf.",
      "Then he was hit in an explosion, the Netherlands-based nonprofit added.",
      "One of Ajjour's arms was completely severed, while the other was left severely injured and ultimately had to be amputated.",
      "\u201cOne of the most difficult things Mahmoud\u2019s mother explained to me was how when Mahmoud first came to the realization that his arms were amputated,\u201d Abu Elouf said in the statement from World Press Photo. \u201cThe first sentence he said to her was, \u2018How will I be able to hug you?\u2019\u201d",
      "Ajjour's mother, Nour Ajjour recalled that painful moment in a phone interview with NBC News on Friday.",
      "\"The first few days were very difficult. He was in a lot of pain as there was no anaesthetic,\" she said. \"He would look at his hands and not see them. He would scream and say, 'where are my hands?' And the first thing he said was, 'how will I hug you?' and 'how will I pray?'\"",
      "Ajjour was evacuated out of Gaza for treatment in Qatar's capital, Doha, where Abu Elouf took his portrait for The New York Times. The photographer also fled to the city.",
      "Ajjour is one of hundreds of children in Gaza to have lost at least one limb during the war, which has seen more than 51,000 people killed since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "UNICEF warned in December 2023 that around 1,000 children in Gaza had seen one or both legs amputated alone since Oct. 7, 2023, when Israel began its military campaign in the enclave following the Hamas-led terror attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "\u201cThese are unbelievable numbers,\u201d Dr. Ahmed Al-Fara,\u00a0head of the pediatric department at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza\u2019s Khan Younis told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground in an interview earlier this month, noting that thousands of children have also been killed and more still have been left without one or both parents.",
      "Al-Fara said he could not understand \u201cthe silence of the world\u201d in the midst of the widespread devastation in Gaza, where much of the enclave has been destroyed.",
      "Many of the operations children in Gaza have had to undergo have been done without anesthetic, according to UNICEF, with the enclave's health care system also hit hard by Israel's offensive, which it restarted last month after a pause in the fighting.",
      "Talks for a permanent end to the fighting were supposed to begin after the first phase of the ceasefire deal \u2014 in which Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees \u2014 ended March 1.",
      "But Israeli forces\u00a0shattered the fragile truce and have since launched airstrikes on the enclave while also resuming military ground operations.",
      "Israel has also barred the entry of medical supplies, along with food, water and other vital aid, during a more than monthlong blockade of the enclave.",
      "Efforts to secure a more permanent ceasefire and secure the release of hostages held in Gaza have so far failed to yield results.",
      "In the meantime, Ajjour is learning how to live without his arms.",
      "\"We all help Mahmoud in everything, in food, drink, clothing and the smallest things.\" But she said her son is also learning to use his feet to do things like writing and playing games on his mobile phone.",
      "His hope now, she said, is to receive prosthetic limbs \u2014 a dream now shared by a growing number of children in Gaza."

      "With its Latin beats and pulsating rhythms, reggaeton music has conquered dance floors across the world, but it\u2019s being put to a different use in China: college students are using the strains of J Balvin and Bad Bunny to help them learn Spanish.",
      "According to a study from Barcelona\u2019s Universitat Pompeu Fabra, the number of Chinese students taking its translation and language science classes has risen 37% from five years ago, but China\u2019s formal educational resources for learning Spanish are far less developed than they are for learning English.",
      "Instead, students are turning to social media sites and streaming services such as NetEase Cloud Music (NECM) to engage with digital language content, with translations of reggaeton songs garnering millions of views on the platform.",
      "The UPF study, which was published last month in the journal \u201cLanguage and Intercultural Communication,\u201d says that amateur translators often collaborate with Latin music lovers on the popular streaming site, using various \u201cintercultural mediation strategies\u201d to make it easier for the Chinese public to understand some of reggaeton\u2019s more niche or idiomatic Spanish cultural references without Chinese equivalents.",
      "The report says that around 2 in 3 translators get past the barriers of language and culture by swapping Spanish expressions with other Chinese imagery. The expression \u201cget stood up,\u201d for example, becomes \u201cfree[ing] a dove\u201d \u2014 a Chinese expression for breaking a promise.",
      "Even after they\u2019ve cleared cultural hurdles, users wanting to spread hits such as \u201cDespacito\u201d and \u201cGasolina\u201d to Guangzhou and Chengdu then need to satisfy China\u2019s censors.",
      "As with TikTok, certain words and phrases are redacted on Chinese social media, especially those containing sexual references, which regularly come up in reggaeton songs.",
      "While asterisks placed between Chinese characters by translators can help bypass this censorship, Mandarin phrases and characters are usually not separated by spaces as they are in English. That means starring out frowned-upon language can alter the meanings of lyrics and add an extra challenge to translators.",
      "Using cultural output such as French cinema or Italian cooking is a language learning method that has long been deployed by teachers the world over. Spreading reggaeton to China may be helping drive an interest in Spanish culture \u2014 at least at UPF anyway.",
      "The university's cohort of Chinese students has grown by almost a third to 275 in the past five years.",
      "One of them, whose name the report changes to \u201cBenito,\u201d has 1,300 followers on NECM and his translations have been viewed more than 2 million times."

      "Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi both arrived late Saturday morning for the negotiations at the Omani Embassy in Rome. The talks took place as both sides sought to ease growing tensions over potential military action and Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions.",
      "At risk is a possible American or Israeli military strike on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites, or the Iranians following through on their threats to pursue a nuclear weapon.",
      "Following the talks, Araghchi told Iranian state television they were \"held in a constructive atmosphere\" and \"moving forward.\"",
      "\"There is no reason for too much optimism, we cannot say that we are really optimistic,\" he told the outlet. \"We must be very cautious, but there is no reason for much pessimism either.\"",
      "In a statement, Oman\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Witkoff and Araghchi agreed to enter the next phase of discussions \u201cthat aim to seal a fair, enduring and binding deal.\u201d The statement said the deal will ensure Iran is free of nuclear weapons and lift sanctions against the country while continuing to allow it \u201cto develop peaceful nuclear energy.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m for stopping Iran, very simply, from having a nuclear weapon,\u201d Trump said Friday. \u201cI want Iran to be great and prosperous and terrific.\u201d",
      "The New York Times reported on Wednesday that Trump had privately waved off Israeli proposals to strike Iranian nuclear sites, preferring instead to pursue a renegotiated deal.",
      "Last week, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a statement that actions taken during the first stage of talks in Oman were \u201cgood,\u201d and must be \u201cpursued carefully.\u201d",
      "The talks represent a historic moment, given the decades of enmity between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic Revolution overthrew a U.S.-backed regime,\u00a0and a U.S. embassy hostage crisis that same year.",
      "Since then, the U.S. has imposed rounds of crippling economic sanctions on Iran. In 2018, during Trump\u2019s first term, he unilaterally withdrew from an accord Iran had struck with world leaders that had drastically limited Tehran\u2019s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.",
      "The heart of the current talks remains Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment, a key indicator of how close a country may be to developing a nuclear weapon.",
      "Under the 2015 nuclear accord, Iran agreed to cap enrichment at 3.67%, far below the 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium. The limit was intended to ensure the program remained civilian in nature. Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, the deal offered Iran billions in sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear ambitions.",
      "The deal was signed by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \u2014 the U.S., Russia, France, China and the United Kingdom \u2014 as well as Germany and the European Union.",
      "But that agreement began to unravel in 2018 when Trump pulled the U.S. out, calling it \u201cthe worst deal ever.\u201d His first administration imposed sweeping sanctions that choked Iran\u2019s economy and isolated its financial and energy sectors.",
      "In turn, Iran rolled back its limits and\u00a0 is believed to have enriched uranium up to 60%, closer to the weapons-grade level of 90%.",
      "Araghchi and Witkoff met in Oman last Saturday in talks both sides described as positive and constructive, though Iran has said since that it has been confused over the mixed messaging by the Trump administration on whether it wants Iran to completely dismantle its entire nuclear program.",
      "Last week, Witkoff posted on X that Iran must \u201cstop and eliminate its nuclear enrichment and weaponization program.\u201d",
      "The previous day, on Fox News, the special envoy had stated that \u201cthe conversation with the Iranians\u201d would focus on limiting uranium enrichment at 3.67 % for civil nuclear purposes.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s apparent contradiction underscores the tensions that have surrounded the current talks, clouded also by lingering suspicion of Trump following the collapse of the JCPOA in 2018. Tehran remains deeply wary.",

      "Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if no agreement is reached. Ahead of Saturday\u2019s talks, the U.S. moved a second aircraft carrier into regional waters. The president also threatened to extend tariffs on nations that continue buying Iranian oil, atop the litany of sanctions already in force."

Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said frequent strong aftershocks continue to shake central Myanmar almost daily, increasing fear and uncertainty among affected residents,\u00a0disrupting response effort\u00a0s and exacerbating the pressure on already limited resources and services.",
      "\u201cThree weeks after catastrophic twin earthquakes hit Myanmar on 28 March, the worst-affected communities are still without safe shelter, clean water and sanitation, stable electricity, health care and essential services,\u201d the report said.",
      "The epicenter of the 7.7 magnitude quake was near Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, but it hit a wide swath of the country, causing significant damage to six regions and states including the capital, Naypyitaw.",
      "It also worsened an already dire\u00a0humanitarian crisis\u00a0triggered by the country\u2019s civil war that had internally displaced more than 3 million people and left nearly 20 million in need, according to the United Nations.",
      "A report in the state-run Myanma Alinn newspaper published on Saturday said the quake\u2019s death toll had reached 3,726, with 5,105 people injured and 129 still missing. It said 1,975 international rescuers and medical workers from 25 countries had collaborated with local rescuers in saving 653 people and recovering 753 bodies from under rubble.",
      "Myanma Alinn said 65,096 houses and buildings, 2,514 schools, 4,317 Buddhist monasterial living quarters, 6,027 pagodas and temples, 350 hospitals and clinics, 170 bridges, 586 dams and 203 sections of the country\u2019s main highway were damaged by the earthquake.",
      "Myanmar Fire Services Department, an official emergency services agency operating in many areas of the country, said in statements posted Friday on its Facebook page that rescue workers were carrying out relief, search and cleaning debris from the big buildings, and had returned valuable jewelry, cash, and documents found among the rubble to their owners.",
      "It also said that rescuers recovered two bodies from collapsed buildings in Mandalay.",
      "An official from Myanmar Rescue Federation (Mandalay), which has been operating along with the firefighters, told The Associated Press on Friday that the priority three weeks on from the earthquake was to clear bodies and debris from under bigger buildings, while also providing assistance to the survivors affected by the earthquake.",
      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he fears arrest for speaking without authorization, said the number of bodies recovered daily has decreased to only one or two.",
      "Another emergency services worker in Mandalay, similarly speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of\u00a0rescue teams operating in Mandalay has been steadily decreasing\u00a0as most of the international rescue teams had returned to their countries after their work to find survivors was considered completed. He said local rescue workers were mainly participating in clearing debris and providing assistance.",
      "The United Nations Development Program earlier this month estimated that at least 2.5 million tons, or roughly 125,000 truckloads, of debris from the quake needs to be removed. It based its estimate on remote sensing analysis of images obtained by satellites.",
      "UN-Habitat, the U.N. agency for human settlements, said in a statement on Friday that its staff and the Myanmar Engineering Society were collaborating in assessing widespread building damage in earthquake-affected regions.",
      "In Naypyitaw, almost all rescuers have ceased their relief efforts, while government buildings that were damaged by the earthquake have not yet been repaired and remain in their post-earthquake condition, said a resident who asked not to be named for security reasons. In residential areas, people have almost completed clearing the debris on their own.",
      "Saturday\u2019s report in Myanma Alinn said Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, head of the military government, told his Cabinet members during a meeting on Friday that the urban layout of Naypyitaw will be redesigned.",
      "Naypyitaw became Myanmar\u2019s capital in 2006 after being built at great expense almost from scratch next to what had once been a logging center inhabited by largely by farmers. It is notable for its grandiose government buildings and under-utilized multi-lane roads."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Marcus Wu\u2019s home racing simulator setup needs one more thing: a manual gearshift. A decade ago, one from a Western brand would have been a no-brainer for gamers like the 12-year-old Hongkonger.",
      "As President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war with Beijing escalates, the fact that Wu opted for a gearshift from Chinese manufacturer Moza illustrates how far Chinese manufacturers have come in competing with their Western counterparts on affordability and quality.",
      "The deepening economic conflict between the U.S. and China, the world\u2019s two largest economies, has the potential to wreak havoc on a complex web of globalized commerce. And Trump\u2019s attempts to claw back manufacturing to American shores could have unintended consequences, including giving Chinese technology manufacturers an edge at a time when American products are already becoming expensive.",
      "Wu and his father-cum-financier, Mingfai, have already made their choice, opting for a Chinese alternative over American brands such as the Oregon-based Thrustmaster. \u201cIf only the price was good but the quality wasn\u2019t, then I wouldn\u2019t have bought this,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cBut this is cheaper and works great.\u201d",
      "The duo were browsing Hong Kong\u2019s Sham Shui Po computer market \u2014 a sprawling hub of small tech stores selling everything from computer parts to gaming equipment for casual gamers and enthusiasts alike.",
      "To residents and tourists from mainland China \u2014 a country with a gaming market of half a billion users \u2014 the market is a one-stop shop, featuring top American brands including Dell, Corsair and the Nasdaq-listed Swiss manufacturer Logitech.",
      "Those are just some of the companies competing for market share in a gaming industry that accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates will be worth $300 billion by 2027. According to China\u2019s Game Industry Report, China\u2019s gamers contributed $44 billion in sales revenues to the industry last year.",
      "To be sure, Western brands are still popular when it comes to big-ticket items like monitors, processors and storage devices, but sellers at the market told NBC News that Chinese brands have been knocking it out of the park when it comes to accessories, like mice, keyboards and simulator setups.",
      "\u201cSo many Chinese manufacturers popped up after the pandemic,\u201d said Dennis Leung, a sales assistant at a store that specializes in gaming peripherals. \u201cThey often provide an extremely cheap and bargain price compared to the whole market,\u201d he said.",
      "Standing in front of a table of 30 mice, Leung held up two with identical feel and weight. The Chinese option, which was cheaper and more powerful, had been outselling its Western counterpart, he said.",
      "The Trump administration last week issued a memorandum saying that electronics including computers, smartphones and some components will be temporarily exempt from levies imposed on Chinese imports.",
      "But Trump\u2019s indication that duties on semiconductors and other technology could be on their way means it\u2019s still unclear whether electronics could get more expensive in the U.S. and whether prices of American-made products could go up for the rest of the world, too.",
      "That uncertainty may already be causing nervousness at companies such as Dell \u2014 the $56 billion tech giant has a 20% share of the global gaming market \u2014 as well as the $12 billion market cap for Logitech and specialists such as Corsair, which is worth $630 million.",
      "The administration\u2019s market-roiling tariffs come at a time when the quality of Chinese products has already vastly improved. That\u2019s giving Hong Kong\u2019s vendors a chance to capitalize.",
      "When it comes to buying gaming accessories, shoppers don\u2019t really care where the end product is coming from, Kira Fong, manager of another store in the market, told NBC News. \u201cMost people just look for quality. They still want the best equipment,\u201d he said.",
      "Analysts expect Chinese-made tech products only to get better.",
      "\u201cPeople are choosing more Chinese-made products in each industry, not just personal computers, gaming, smartphones or electric vehicles,\u201d said Xiao Feng Zeng, who analyzes China\u2019s gaming and esports industry at Niko Partners, an Asian and European gaming intelligence firm.",
      "\u201cTheir quality is better and the price is cheaper,\u201d the Shanghai-based vice president said, adding that Trump\u2019s policies will hurt America\u2019s ability to compete for young gamers.",
      "The policies of the president, who refers to himself as \u201cTariff Man,\u201d are already feeding through into higher prices.",
      "Hyte, a gaming PC sister brand of the California-based iBuyPower, said this month on X that while it was standing by increased prices, those prices will not be sustainable long term.",
      "That was not a problem for Marcus Wu, and more importantly his dad, at checkout at the Sham Shui Po market.",
      "With his son excited to go home and play with his new gearshift, Mingfai Wu breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Chinese,\u201d the elder Wu said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s cheap and good!\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Scientists have grown a nugget-sized piece of chicken using a new method that can deliver nutrients and oxygen to artificial tissues, marking a major breakthrough in cultured meat.",
      "While labs have been producing lifelike tissues for more than a decade, previous methods only made small, scattered cell balls less than 1 millimeter thick, or about 0.04 inches. It was a challenge to hold the cell groupings together in a way that more closely mimicked the texture of muscle, and the current generation of lab-grown meats are often tiny pieces clumped together around an edible scaffolding.",
      "However, a team of researchers in Japan have achieved new lengths, growing a single, square piece of chicken 2.7 inches (7 centimeters) wide and 0.7 inches (2 centimeters) thick with a new lab tool, according to a paper published Wednesday in the journal Trends in Biotechnology. Weighing in at about a third of an ounce, the artificial chicken muscle is a small bite, but is believed to be the world\u2019s largest chunk of lab-grown\u00a0meat.",
      "The scientists developed a bioreactor that mimicked a circulatory system, using 50 hollow fibers acting like veins to distribute nutrients and oxygen to the meat, keeping cells alive and guiding them to grow in the specified directions.",
      "The bioreactor delivered nutrients and oxygen through the tissue using tiny, precision-laid hollow fibers, using a method that, for the first time, could sustain growth across relatively long cellular distances.",
      "This piece of chicken was not made using food-grade materials, and the scientists have not tasted it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s exciting to discover that these tiny fibers can also effectively help create artificial tissues,\u201d Shoji Takeuchi, a co-author of the study and a professor at the University of Tokyo in Japan, said in a statement. Hollow fibers had previously been used in household water filters and dialysis machines for patients with kidney disease.",
      "The new approach, he said, could be a scalable way to produce whole-cut cultured meat, adding that it could yield advancements not just in food production, but also regenerative medicine, drug testing and biohybrid robotics.",
      "The new technology could accelerate the commercial viability of cultured meat, but there are further challenges ahead.",
      "Replicating the texture and taste of whole-cut meat remains \u201cdifficult,\u201d Takeuchi said, adding that larger pieces will also require\u00a0better oxygen delivery.",
      "Additionally, the process of removing tiny hollow fibers that help grow the meat, currently done by researchers manually, needs to be automated, he said, adding that future lab-grown meat will also have to be made with food-grade materials before they can be eaten.",
      "Consumers in the United States have mixed attitudes toward cultured meat. About a third say they are not willing to try cultivated chicken, and 40% reject cultivated pork, according to a 2024 poll conducted by Purdue University in Indiana.",
      "Ethical and environmental concerns may prompt consumers to opt for plant-based meat substitutes, but cultured meat presents a different hurdle to acceptance partly due to perceived food risks, such as its unnaturalness, unfamiliarity and concerns about whether it is safe or healthy to eat, according to a 2022 study.",
      "Currently, there is little cultured meat in the market, but they can be legally sold to consumers in\u00a0three countries: Singapore, the U.S. and Israel. Only two California companies are authorized to sell cultured meat in the U.S., while Florida and Alabama have banned its sales.",
      "In 2013, the world\u2019s first lab-grown burger made from cow stem cells was cooked and publicly tasted in London, to ambivalent reviews."

      "\u201cIt is in no one\u2019s interest to claim prematurely that we have detected life,\u201d Cambridge astrophysicist Nikku Madhusudhan, who led the study, said during a news conference Tuesday.",
      "But, he added, \u201cWe want to remain open and do more experiments and theoretical calculations\u201d that can strengthen evidence that the molecule they detected, known as dimethyl sulfide (DMS), is present on the exoplanet that was discovered in 2015 by NASA\u2019s Kepler mission.",
      "Madhusudhan and his colleagues are building on their research from 2023, in which they detected carbon-based molecules in the atmosphere of K2-18b using the James Webb Telescope's mid-infrared instrument.",
      "That finding suggested that an almost identical molecule to DMS, known as dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), could also be present on the exoplanet \u2014 the first hint that K2-18b may be a hycean world, meaning one with a warm ocean abundant with life under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.",
      "\u201cThe only scenario that currently explains all the data obtained so far from JWST, including the past and present observations, is one where K2-18 b is a hycean world teeming with life,\u201d Madhusudhan said.",
      "At the same time, he noted, there was still a 0.3% chance that their observation was a statistical fluke. \u201cWe need to be open and continue exploring other scenarios,\u201d he added.",
      "K2-18b is part of the \u201csub-Neptune\u201d class of nearly 6,000 exoplanets that have been discovered beyond the solar system since the 1990s.",
      "Finding evidence of life in the cosmos was the \"holy grail\" of exoplanet science, Madhusudhan said.",
      "Jake Taylor, an astrophysics and supernumerary fellow at Oxford University, also expressed caution over the findings while adding that they were \u201ca good first step\u201d in the search for biosignature gases, which are found in a planet\u2019s atmosphere and suggest the presence of life.",
      "\u201cI do not believe this is the biosignature detection that will revolutionize astronomy,\u201d he said, adding that DMS and DMDS molecules could also be produced abiotically, for example, in comets.",
      "Taylor added that a re-analysis of the data from the MIRI instrument, which has proven to be difficult among the exoplanet community in the past, along with an independent verification from a different team of scientists, would \u201cconvince me that these signals are real.\u201d",
      "Despite the unknowns that can only be answered by repeated observations and more theoretical and experimental studies, Madhusudhan said in a video, finding signs of life elsewhere was \u201cone of the most profound moments for me personally as well as an astronomer.\u201d",
      "He added that even suggestions of \u201ca new chemical process that is not produced by life,\u201d could be a monumental breakthrough, because, \u201chowever you put it, we are seeing new chemical processes on a planet that could be habitable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is, in my view, a transformational moment for finding our place in the universe as a species,\u201d Madhusudhan said.",
      "CORRECTION (April 17, 2025, 2:50 p.m. ET): Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated how far away K2-18b is. It is 729 trillion miles away, not 7 trillion miles."

      "Children crowding around a charity kitchen holding empty pots and pans clamoring for food to take to their families. Hours spent in search of clean water and scouring piles of garbage looking for trash to burn for a fire to cook or keep warm.",
      "These scenes, which NBC News\u2019 crew in the Gaza Strip captured over the past week, come as humanitarian agencies sound the alarm over a dire and worsening situation in in the Palestinian enclave as Israel enforces a blockade on food, water, fuel, medical supplies and other aid and goods.",
      "Israeli officials maintain there is \"no shortage\" of aid in Gaza and accuse Hamas of withholding supplies. Israel says its blockade is crucial to its goal of weakening the militant group's control over the population.",
      "The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the World Food Programme (WFP) told NBC News they had seen \"no evidence\" of a diversion of aid in Gaza. Both warned that supplies in the enclave were running out.",
      "'Scraping the barrel'",
      "Humanitarian groups describe a spiraling crisis on the ground, with bakeries shuttered for weeks because of a lack of wheat, food parcels for families running out, supplies of hot meals dwindling and medical supplies drying up.",
      "\"In terms of humanitarian supplies ... I mean, to say dwindling would be putting it nicely,\" \u00a0Liz Allcock, head of humanitarian protection of Medical Aid for Palestinians, a United Kingdom-based humanitarian organization, told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really scraping the barrel in terms of being able to provide anything of substance,\" Allcock, said, speaking from Gaza.",
      "Abeer Etefa, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme, described the situation in Gaza as \"dire and worsening,\" with all WFP-supported bakeries across the territory closing after wheat flour ran out March 31. By early April, she said, the WFP had also exhausted its stocks of food parcels for distribution.",
      "\"Remaining stocks of hot meals commodities are being dispatched to the kitchens of partners providing hot meals,\" she said, adding: \"We have around 1,000 tons or less left for these hot meals kitchens.\"",
      "The WFP and its partners have 85,000 tons of food waiting to enter the enclave, she said.",
      "The\u00a0Global Nutrition Cluster, a coalition of humanitarian groups, has warned that in March alone, 3,696 children were newly admitted for care for acute malnutrition alone, out of 91,769 children screened \u2014 a marked increase from February, when 2,027 children were admitted from a total of 83,823 screened, OCHA said in a report Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, the United Nations has sounded the alarm that medical supplies in the enclave are running low, while casualties continue to fill hospitals.",
      "Etefa added that Israeli military activity across the enclave was affecting humanitarian groups' ability to deliver aid, with the decision to block the flow of aid coming just more than two weeks before Israel shattered its ceasefire with Hamas last month, bringing two months of relative calm in the Gaza Strip to an end.",
      "Israeli policy on aid",
      "In a statement Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said his country\u2019s policy in Gaza was \u201cclear and unequivocal,\u201d including the policy to stop humanitarian aid, a move he said \u201cundermines Hamas' control over the population, and creating an infrastructure for distribution through civilian companies later.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Israeli Foreign Ministry has maintained that there is \"no shortage of aid,\" pointing to the fact that more than 25,000 aid trucks entered the territory during Israel\u2019s ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Hamas was withholding supplies from civilians \"in order to create an image of shortage,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein told NBC News on Wednesday without providing evidence.",
      "OCHA spokesman Jens Laerke said the U.N. body's team on the ground described \"no evidence of diversion of aid.\" Etefa said the WFP also had not seen any evidence, adding that the organization did not experience any looting during the ceasefire.",
      "Hamas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusation. But Thursday, the militant group, which has faced protests calling for its ouster and an end to the war, accused Israel of committing a war crime by \"declaring the use of starvation as a weapon.\"",
      "Under international humanitarian law, parties of a conflict cannot use starvation of a civilian population as a method of warfare or deprive civilians of essential supplies as a legitimate means to subdue an enemy.",
      "Marmorstein previously denied that Israel is violating international humanitarian law with its blockade in a post on X, saying war parties are not obliged to allow aid in if  it is \"likely to assist the military or economic efforts of the enemy.\"",
      "The war in Gaza began after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, which killed 1,200 and saw around 250 kidnapped, according to Israeli counts. Israel's military offensive in the enclave since then has killed more than 51,000 people, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, which has been run by Hamas since 2007.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Data published by COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, shows that 25,200 aid trucks entered Gaza during the ceasefire, carrying more than 447,500 tons of aid into the enclave.",
      "Before the war began, around 500 trucks carrying food and other supplies were entering Gaza each day, according to the British Red Cross. This suggests that by prewar standards, the 25,200 trucks that entered during the ceasefire, according to COGAT's data, would likely be sufficient for around 1\u00bd months, a point reached this week.",
      "COGAT's database shows \u201cno data\u201d for aid entering the enclave between March 2 and April 16.",
      "Presented with the above data and asked to comment on the current aid situation on the ground, a spokesperson for COGAT told NBC News they could only confirm that more than 25,000 aid trucks had entered Gaza during the ceasefire. The spokesperson referred other questions related to the flow of aid to Israel's political leadership.",
      "In a report released this month, the WFP warned that humanitarian aid is the \u201cprimary food source\u201d for 80% of households across Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, it said Israel\u2019s closure of crossings into the territory had \u201cexacerbated the fragility of the Gaza market,\u201d leading prices to soar between 150% and 700% compared with prewar levels, and by 29% to as much as 1,400% above prices during the ceasefire.",
      "As officials debate the reality of the situation on the ground, families across the enclave tell NBC News that they are struggling to survive.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been deprived of everything \u2014 food, water, school \u2014 even clothes,\u201d 12-year-old Hasan Abu Jazar told NBC News\u2019 crew on Monday after waiting in line in Al-Mawasi to gather water at an increasingly rare distribution point. \"I'm tired.\""
