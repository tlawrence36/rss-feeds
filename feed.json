      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders",
      "Superman already has a lot on his shoulders. It seems unfair to add the fate of the summer movie season to his list. But he's not alone \u2014 Marvel Studios is also returning to theaters in a big way with two movies this summer, \u201cThunderbolts\u201d and \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps.\u201d",
      "Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the movie business to a halt, and two years after the strikes, the industry has yet to fully recover. Critics may have complained of superhero fatigue, but after several summers of depleted offerings, it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re a vital part of the mix.",
      "Superheroes alone don't make for a healthy marketplace, however, and this year studios have set a full slate for every kind of moviegoer, with over 40 wide releases spanning genres.",
      "\u201cThis is the summer where all this product that we\u2019ve all been working on for the last few years is finally coming into the marketplace, so I\u2019m very optimistic,\u201d says Joseph Kosinski, who directed \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt.",
      "Summer begins early in Hollywood, on the first weekend in May and that kick-off can make or break that pivotal 123 day corridor that has historically accounted for around 40% of the annual box office.",
      "After the strikes upended the 2024 summer calendar, this year Disney is back in that familiar first weekend spot with \u201cThunderbolts.\" Memorial Day weekend could also be a behemoth with the live action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible \u2013 The Final Reckoning.\" With a new \u201cJurassic World,\u201d a live action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\u201d and the Formula One movie also on the schedule through June and July, the summer season has the potential to be the biggest in the post-COVID era.",
      "There are also family pics (\u201cSmurfs,\u201d \u201cElio\"); action and adventures (\u201cBallerina,\u201d \u201cThe Karate Kid: Legends\u201d); horrors, thrillers and slashers (\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d \u201cM3GAN 2.0\"); romances (\u201cMaterialists,\u201d \u201cJane Austen Wrecked My Life\u201d); dramas (\u201cSorry, Baby,\u201d \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d); a new Wes Anderson movie (\u201cThe Phonecian Scheme\u201d); and comedies (\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d \u201cBride Hard,\u201d \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d).",
      "\u201cDraw me a blueprint of a perfect summer lineup: 2025 is it,\" says Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a fun twist on what a movie like this could be,\u201d says \u201cThunderbolts\u201d director Jake Schreier.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a personal journey for Superman that\u2019s entirely new,\u201d says \u201cSuperman\u201d director James Gunn. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about the robots and the flying dogs and all that stuff. It\u2019s taking a very real person and putting them in the middle of this outrageous situation and outrageous world and playing with that. I think it\u2019s a lot of fun because of that.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s working on an incredibly large scale in terms of world building, but it\u2019s also no different from all of the great comedies and dramas that I\u2019ve done,\u201d says \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d director Matt Shakman. \u201cIn the end, it comes down to character, it comes down to relationships, it comes down to heart and humor.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople say, like, do you feel pressure and the most pressure I feel is from myself as a fan and to Steven Spielberg, to not disappoint him,\" says \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d director Gareth Edwards. \u201cWeirdly what\u2019s great about doing a Jurassic movie is that everybody knows deep down that like half the reason they\u2019re in this business is because of that film and Steven\u2019s work.\u201d",
      "Before the pandemic, all but one summer since 2007 broke the $4 billion mark. Since 2020, only one has: 2023, led by \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The unstable economy might work in the industry\u2019s favor, at least when it comes to moviegoing. Even with increased ticket prices, theatrical movies remain the most affordable entertainment outside of the home and attendance tends to increase during recession years. The annual domestic box office crossed $10 billion for the first time in 2009.",
      "\u201cBy the end of this summer, hopefully people aren\u2019t talking about being in a funk anymore and it feels like we got our mojo back and we\u2019re off to the races,\" Kosinski, who directed the pandemic-era hit \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d says.",

    "story": [
      "The first of three accusers involved in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial has taken the witness stand",
      "NEW YORK -- When Harvey Weinstein' s landmark 2020 #MeToo conviction was overturned, accuser Miriam Haley was frank about her feelings about participating in a retrial: \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to actually go through that again.\u201d",
      "But on Tuesday, Haley became the first of the former movie tycoon\u2019s accusers to take the witness stand as prosecutors seek to convict him again. Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "As Haley started what are expected to be multiple days of testimony, she walked quickly to the witness stand without looking at Weinstein. The ex-studio boss, sitting between his lawyers, looked at her as she passed by and again when prosecutors asked her to identify him from the stand.",
      "Haley told the jury that when she went to meet Weinstein on the sidelines of the 2006 Cannes film festival, all she wanted was work.",
      "But Weinstein commented on her legs, asked for a massage and, when she balked, asked her to give him one, she recalled.",
      "\u201cDid you have any interest whatsoever in the defendant, Harvey Weinstein, romantically or sexually?\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg asked Haley, 48.",
      "\u201cNo, I did not, and I was there to try and find work,\u201d said Haley, who\u2019d been an assistant to another producer.",
      "Her testimony so far closely echoes what she told the prior jury, though she hasn't yet gotten to the July 2006 date when she has said Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her. She recounted earlier interactions with Weinstein that alternated between being personally off-putting and professionally encouraging for her.",
      "Haley said she left the Cannes meeting crying and feeling humiliated. But she accepted when Weinstein arranged a basic assistant job for her on his company's reality show \u201cProject Runway\u201d in June 2006.",
      "After the roughly three-week gig ended and Haley thanked him by email, Weinstein communicated that he'd heard good things about her work and invited her to meet at a Manhattan hotel lobby, she said as prosecutors displayed her 2006 calendar with the meeting noted.",
      "She and Weinstein talked business, and he was \u201cvery respectful and quite charming\u201d and talked about other potential job opportunities, she recalled.",
      "\u201cWere you flirty or suggesting anything sexual between you and the defendant at that meeting?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Haley replied.",
      "She said another meeting in Weinstein's office also went pleasantly and professionally, and so did a ride with him, his assistant and his driver back to her apartment \u2014 and then the Hollywood honcho suddenly suggested she accompany him to Paris fashion shows.",
      "Haley said she had no interest in going but gave a vague response, \u201ctrying to be polite.\u201d They said goodbye.",
      "Yet Weinstein repeatedly asked her to come to Paris with him for fashion shows, even showing up uninvited and barging into her apartment to try to persuade her, she said.",
      "Haley told jurors she again declined, but Weinstein was \u201cinsistent and overwhelming,\u201d so she told him: \u201cI heard about your reputation with women.\u201d",
      "Weinstein took a step back, seeming offended, and quizzed her about what she meant, she recalled. She told jurors she actually hadn't heard much about Weinstein at that point but was just trying to avoid the Paris trip.",
      "Eventually, Weinstein left the apartment and backed off, she said.",
      "Almost two decades later, a series of sexual assault and sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein would energize the #MeToo movement's demands to hold powerful men accountable for misconduct toward women.",
      "Haley, who has also gone by the name Mimi Haleyi, is expected to continue testifying Wednesday.",
      "The retrial is happening because New York's highest court found the original trial was tainted by \u201cegregious\u201d judicial rulings and prejudicial testimony.",
      "The retrial includes charges based on allegations from Haley and another accuser from the original trial, Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor. She alleges that Weinstein raped her in 2013.",
      "He\u2019s also being tried, for the first time, on an allegation of forcing oral sex on former model Kaja Sokola in 2006. Her claim wasn't part of the first trial.",
      "Mann and Sokola also are expected to testify at some point.",
      "Weinstein's attorneys have argued that all three accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting work in show business.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they give permission for their names to be used. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "This story has been corrected to show that Haley is 48, not 47.",

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The main cause of Gene Hackman's death was heart disease, but he was also in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease and likely had not eaten for a long time, according to a new autopsy report.",
      "The report documents the 95-year-old actor\u2019s poor heart health, noting he had experienced congestive heart failure, an aortic valve replacement and an irregular heart beat. He was given a pacemaker in April 2019.",
      "Hackman\u2019s carbon monoxide concentration was less than 5% saturation, which is within the normal range. He tested negative for the hantavirus, which is a rare but potentially fatal disease spread by infected rodent droppings.",
      "Authorities have said Hackman\u2019s wife, Betsy Arakawa, likely died Feb. 11 at home from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Her autopsy report hasn\u2019t yet been released.",
      "A toxicology report says Hackman tested negative for alcohol and intoxicating drugs, but that he had a low concentration of acetone in his system that indicates prolonged fasting.",
      "Hackman appeared to have outlived Arakawa at home by about a week, possibly unaware of his wife's death. Hackman\u2019s pacemaker showed an abnormal heart rhythm on Feb. 18 \u2014 the day he likely died, according to the state's chief medical examiner.",
      "Records released earlier in the investigation showed Arakawa made phone calls and internet searches as she scoured for information on flu-like symptoms and breathing techniques.",
      "Recently released videos outline the scope of the investigation into the deaths of Hackman and Arakawa.",
      "Before they understood how Hackman and Arakawa died, authorities recorded themselves conducting interviews with workers and returning to Hackman\u2019s home to search for more evidence. Detectives searched the home in early March for Arakawa\u2019s laptop and other clues.",

      "The annual AFI Life Achievement Award presentation is always a starry night in Hollywood, but Saturday\u2019s ceremony at the Dolby Theatre brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema to honor Francis Ford Coppola",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Steven Spielberg proclaimed \u201cThe Godfather\u201d the \u201cgreatest American film ever made,\u201d Robert De Niro teasingly bemoaned being cast in the sequel and not the original and Harrison Ford fought back tears reflecting on his role in the 1974 film, \u201cThe Conversation.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all was Francis Ford Coppola, who on Saturday received the AFI Life Achievement Award at a ceremony at Dolby Theatre that brought together legendary stars from a seemingly bygone era of cinema,",
      "A founding AFI trustee, Coppola\u2019s recognition from the organization was a kind of full circle moment for the \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d director.",
      "\u201cWhen I was a kid there was the Oscars and that was it. Now they\u2019re going to have an award show for the best award show,\u201d the 86-year-old said on the red carpet ahead of the show. \u201cBut this is a little different because it\u2019s a personal recognition of the people that you\u2019ve known all your life and your colleagues over many years, so it\u2019s like a homecoming in a way.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou, sir, are peerless. You have taken what came before and redefined the canon of American film,\u201d Spielberg said.",
      "Coppola sat between Spielberg and George Lucas, as actors and fellow filmmakers like Spike Lee, Dustin Hoffman, Al Pacino and Morgan Freeman took turns gushing over the Oscar winner.",
      "\u201cDreamer of dreams on a dime, teller of tales that cost and lost millions. But tonight, (expletive) the bankers and the bank,\u201d Freeman said to laughs and cheers.",
      "Lucas, Coppola\u2019s longtime friend and colleague, presented him with the award. The pair have known each other for decades and cofounded their own production company, American Zoetrope, in 1969.",
      "\u201cYou rounded up a bunch of young film students, gathered us together. We moved to San Francisco, hoping to beat the system. And we did. Like the filmmakers from the dawn of the art form, we had no rules. We wrote them, and you were holding the pen,\u201d Lucas said.",
      "Coppola was mostly stoic throughout the ceremony as Hollywood sang his praises \u2014 until he accepted the award at the end of the night. He beamed as he approached the stage and thanked the room, which was filled with some of his family members as well as multigenerational A-listers.",
      "\u201cNow I understand here, this place that created me, my home, isn\u2019t really a place at all, but you \u2014 friends, colleagues, teachers, playmates, family, neighbors, all the beautiful faces are welcoming me back,\u201d he said. \u201cI am and will always be nothing more than one of you.\u201d",
      "Coppola was the 50th recipient of the award first handed out to John Ford in 1973.",
      "Guests were served wine from the Francis Ford Coppola Winery and after dinner \u2014 true to his Italian heritage \u2014 a trio of cannolis. Actors who have worked with Coppola painted a unified picture of him as a director, reminiscing on how they were invited to participate and educated about film in a way that empowered them.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very professorial. He talks about history and things and even older movies in the scene he\u2019s inspired by,\u201d said \u201cThe Godfather III\u201d star Andy Garcia. \u201cYou go into working with him in a movie, and you go in seeking an associate\u2019s degree and you would walk out with a master\u2019s.\u201d",
      "Coppola last year released his long-in development \u201cMegalopolis,\u201d a Roman epic set in a modern New York. The film drew mixed reviews from critics and flopped with audiences. Coppola, though, has maintained he was compelled to make \u201cMegalopolis\u201d as an artist, not as a businessman. He self-financed the film.",
      "\u201cFor a year in our culture when the importance of the arts is minimized, and our industry is seemingly out in the open that the only metric to judge a film\u2019s success is by how much money it makes, I hang on to individuals like Francis for inspiration, who live through their convictions,\u201d said Adam Driver, who starred in the film.",
      "Last year\u2019s AFI honoree was Nicole Kidman. Other recent recipients include John Williams, Mel Brooks, Denzel Washington and Julie Andrews.",

      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most unforgettable films of the late 1970s and 1980s, as top Hollywood filmmakers like Kubrick, Coppola, Oliver Stone and others grappled with its painful legacy. Few, however, had classic, or even three-dimensional, female characters \u2014 with the notable exception of \u201cComing Home,\u201d which won Jane Fonda an Oscar.",
      "But while these films were almost exclusively about how war dehumanized men \u2014 with female characters mere devices to tell that story \u2014 the opposite was often true of Vietnamese films about the conflict. Many of these were told from a female viewpoint \u2014 the stories of brave and loyal women, for example, left to hold families together.",

An early-career Streep was such a magnetic presence as Linda \u2014 earning an Oscar nomination \u2014 that it disguised a fairly thin role that mainly advanced the men's narrative.",
      "A rare contrast was Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d the same year, in which Fonda and Jon Voight both won Oscars for the tale of a Marine wife embroiled in an intense affair with a wounded veteran at the rehab center where she volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is the only Hollywood film set during the Vietnam War that\u2019s told from the point of view of a female character,\u201d says filmmaker Tony Bui, who also teaches Vietnam War cinema at Columbia University. \u201cThat's really saying something.\u201d",
      "Its tortured journey to the screen is a drama in itself, but 1979's \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d with Martin Sheen as an army captain tasked with assassinating a renegade U.S. colonel (Marlon Brando), is considered a masterpiece of the genre. As in many Hollywood Vietnam films, women are extras in villages, screaming and running from gunfire and deadly explosions \u2014 or killed brutally for no reason at all.",
      "Then there are the Playboy Bunnies, who gyrate to \u201cSuzy Q\u201d as the troops become increasingly frenzied with erotic excitement and eventually storm the stage.",
      "Lan Duong, assistant professor of cinema studies at the University of Southern California, sees Coppola trying to make a connection between sex, warfare and masculinity.",
      "\u201cWith American white women in particular, they\u2019re seen as part of the American mythology around manhood,\u201d Duong says. Full-blooded manhood with raging hormones, she says, is \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
      "In 1986's \u201cPlatoon,\u201d Stone's Oscar-winning depiction of jungle warfare, representation of women comes in a horrific scene in which U.S. troops kills hundreds of innocent villagers, evoking the real-life My Lai massacre. During the slaughter, idealistic soldier Chris (Charlie Sheen) comes upon soldiers raping young women. \u201cShe\u2019s a human being!\u201d he screams. They reply: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in \u2019Nam, man.\u201d",
      "These women are given no voice. They appear \u201conly in relation to the violence inflicted by men,\u201d Bui says.",
      "In Brian de Palma\u2019s \u201cCasualties of War\u201d (1989), the tragic rape victim actually becomes a central character in the plot. This does not mean, however, that we learn much of anything about this Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le).",
      "Based on a real event, the film follows five soldiers whose leader (Sean Penn) devises a sickening plan: The group will kidnap a young girl for \u201crecreation\u201d during a mission.",
      "Only Pvt. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) objects. The four others not only rape the girl, but eventually pump her with bullets. Eriksson takes the case to superiors, who advise him to drop it. But Eriksson persists, and the men earn punishment.",
      "Though important, this brutalized girl is again voiceless. \u201cShe goes from suffering, to suffering more, and then gets killed \u2014 that\u2019s her arc,\u201d says Bui, who includes the movie in a Criterion Channel collection he has curated on Vietnam films.",
      "Kubrick\u2019s memorable 1987 \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d contains two brief, stereotypical scenes involving sex workers. But the most interesting scene involving a female character comes during battle, where a sniper targeting U.S. troops turns out to be a terrified girl in pigtails. As she lies mortally wounded, she begs quietly, \u201cShoot me.\u201d The soldiers oblige.",
      "The stereotypical nature of the sex worker scenes is, for Bui, redeemed somewhat by the character of the sniper (Ngoc Le), whose courage is acknowledged.",
      "In Bui's own \u201cThree Seasons,\u201d a 1999 Vietnamese-American production, sex worker Lan (Diep Bui) is central to the story, an exploration of postwar life in Ho Chi Minh City. A cyclo driver falls in love with Lan and trails her around the city, trying to help her find a better life.",
      "Bui says his research has found that more than half of Vietnamese films about the conflict have female protagonists. One of the most famous, H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d (1974), follows a young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searching for her family in bombed-out Hanoi.",
      "Another, \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes\u201d (1984), tells the story of Duyen (L\u00ea V\u00e2n), a young wife and mother in the rural north whose husband goes to war. Her ailing father-in-law asks frequently why the soldier has not written home. Duyen learns one day that her husband's been dead for a year and enlists a local schoolteacher to help her hide that by forging eloquent letters.",
      "The character is emblematic of the way Vietnamese culture has long portrayed the woman: fierce, loyal and resilient in the face of adversity, argues Duong.",
      "\u201cShe is beautiful. She\u2019s suffering. She\u2019s loyal to the memory of her dead husband,\u201d notes Duong. \u201cIt\u2019s been argued by \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh himself ... that she's a symbol for the nation itself. So it becomes a really rich metaphor for filmmakers.\u201d",
      "The risk, she adds, is that such characters, serving as symbols, can also lack dimension.",
      "Stone is one of the only directors to have explicitly addressed the minimal role of women in his Vietnam works, saying \u201cPlatoon\u201d was deliberately a male-driven narrative.",
      "But with his third and last Vietnam War film, \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d (1993), Stone shifted to the perspective of a real-life Vietnamese woman: Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le), who endures rape and torture as a young woman, then moves to California with her troubled American military husband (Tommy Lee Jones).",
      "\u201cThere is some truth to the criticism of my treatment of women,\u201d Stone said while making the film. \u201cI have a lot to learn about everything, not just women.\u201d",
      "Making his point crystal clear, Stone dedicates the film at the end to his mother, Jacqueline Stone.",

      "Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., amid a shift in priorities and the ousting of leadership at one of the nation\u2019s premier cultural institutions.",
      "Multiple artists and producers involved in the center\u2019s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. And in the wake of the cancellations, Washington\u2019s Capital Pride Alliance has disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,\u201d said June Crenshaw, deputy director of the alliance. \u201cWe are finding another path to the celebration \u2026 but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\u201d",
      "The Kennedy Center\u2019s website still lists Tapestry of Pride on its website with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. There are no other details.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not respond to a request from the AP for comment.",
      "The move comes on the heels of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, with President Donald Trump firing both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who then elected him the new Kennedy Center chairman.",
      "The World Pride event, held every two years, starts in just under a month \u2014 running from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the capital city. But Trump administration policies on transgender rights and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances have sparked concern about what kind of reception attendees will receive.",
      "\u201cI know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,\u201d said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center abruptly canceled within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Roest told the AP he was in the final stages of planning the Kennedy Center performance after months of emails and Zoom calls. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump posted on social media Feb. 7 of the leadership changes and his intention to transform the Kennedy Center\u2019s programming.",
      "Immediately the Kennedy Center became nonresponsive, Roest said. On Feb. 12, he said, he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer stating, \u201cWe are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey went from very eager to host to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that\u2019s not going to stop us.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the cancellation, Roest said he managed to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Crenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be moved to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.",
      "Monica Alford, a veteran event planner with a long history of working with the Kennedy Center, was scheduled to organize an event June 8 as part of Tapestry of Pride, but said she also saw communication abruptly end within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Alford organized the first ever drag brunch on the Kennedy Center rooftop in 2024, and said she regarded the institution \u2014 and its recent expansion known as The Reach \u2014 as \u201cmy home base\u201d and \u201ca safe space for the queer community\u201d",
      "She said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she described as \u201cmeant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.\u201d",
      "She said she mourns the loss of the partnership she nurtured with the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing our community a disservice \u2014 not just the queer community but the entire community,\u201d she said.",
      "Roest said he never received an explanation as to why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center, and he believes most queer artists would make the same choice.",
      "\u201cThere would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it is a hostile performance space.\u201d",

      "Wrexham has sealed promotion to the second tier of English soccer by beating Charlton 3-0",
      "WREXHAM, Wales -- Wrexham fans ignored the warnings. They were always going to.",
      "By the time the final whistle blew on Saturday to confirm promotion to English soccer's second tier, thousands were ready and waiting to storm the home field in celebration.",
      "Flares were lit, red smoke filled the air, Welsh flags were waved proudly and songs sung raucously.",
      "Wrexham was one step from the Premier League and nothing was going to stop this party.",
      "Charlton was beaten 3-0 to ensure Wrexham went up as the third division runner-up behind champion Birmingham, and co-owner Ryan Reynolds reflected on their third promotion in three seasons.",
      "\u201cIt just seemed like an impossible dream,\u201d the movie star said. \u201cWe said five years ago our goal was to make it to the Premier League. There were understandably a lot of laughs, but it feels like a thing that could make it to fruition right now.\u201d",
      "There were warnings of police action for pitch invaders before kickoff. And as the game reached its final moments, an announcement over the loudspeaker told fans it could be stopped if they didn't move back behind barricades.",
      "But everyone inside the club's historic Racecourse Ground knew what was coming, and within seconds of the whistle the field was a sea of red as Wrexham supporters celebrated wildly.",
      "The Welsh soccer team's remarkable rise under Hollywood owners Reynolds and Rob McElhenney has hit a new high \u2014 returning to the second tier for the first time since the 1981-82 campaign.",
      "It means that from next season it will be playing one level below the Premier League, something that was unthinkable just four years ago when it was a struggling non-league team.",
      "Reynolds and McElhenney were part of a full house of nearly 13,000 fans.",
      "\u201cThe stadium and atmosphere is incredible, it\u2019s a massive club and a big project, it will be a special week now,\u201d said striker Sam Smith, who scored two goals in the win.",
      "Who knows what's next for a team that has defied the odds since the actors bought it for $2.5 million in 2021 and turned it into a household name around the world.",
      "\u201cThe owners have come in and done an amazing job. I\u2019m so pleased for them because they deserve it,\u201d manager Phil Parkinson said. \u201cThey\u2019re invested in all the decisions, but they trust us in in our decision making and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve had success over the last three years.\u201d",
      "While celebrations greeted the final whistle, the party began much earlier after promotion rival Wycombe lost to Leyton Orient 1-0.",
      "Wrexham just needed victory then to clinch the second promotion place in League One.",
      "Reynolds posed for selfies with fans outside and served drinks behind the bar in a marquee set up outside the nearby Turf pub, which has earned world renown from the docuseries \u201cWelcome to Wrexham.\u201d",
      "Fans erupted in cheers after the final whistle of Wycombe\u2019s loss, which was shown on a big screen.",
      "Wrexham just needed to finish the job off against fourth-placed Charlton and eased nerves with two goals in the space of three minutes in the first half. Oliver Rathbone\u2019s long shot in the 15th minute was followed by Smith\u2019s volley.",
      "When Smith headed in a third in the 81st the outcome was in no doubt and Wrexham's fans serenaded the players with chants of \u201cWe are going up.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is for those supporters who followed the team in those 15 years in the (non-league) National League in really, really tough times, but stood strong behind their club and they deserve tonight,\u201d Parkinson said.",

      "These 10 films, assembled to mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, range from indelible anti-war classics to Vietnamese portraits of resistance, capturing the vastness of the war\u2019s still-reverberating traumas.",
      "The war was more than a decade in and some eight years from its conclusion when a 25-year-old Martin Scorsese made this six-minute short. In it, a man simply shaves himself before a sink and a mirror. After a few knicks and cuts, he doesn\u2019t stop, continuing until his face is a bloody mess \u2014 a neat but gruesome metaphor to Vietnam.",
      "A young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searches for her family in the bombed-out ruins of Hanoi in H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark of Vietnamese cinema. It\u2019s a work of wartime propaganda (it begins with the intro: \u201chonoring the heroes of Hanoi who defeated the American imperialist B-52 bombing raid\u201d) but also of aching humanity. Set against the December 1972 bombing raids on Hanoi, \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d is cinema made in the very midst of war.",
      "Controversy greeted Peter Davis\u2019 landmark documentary around its release, but time has only proved how soberly clear-eyed it was. Newsreel clips and homefront interviews are contrasted with the horrors on the ground in Vietnam in this penetrating examination of the gulf between American policy and Vietnamese reality. Its title comes from President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s line, said when escalating the war, that \u201cthe ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there.\u201d",
      "It's arguably the preeminent American film about the Vietnam War. No other movie more grandly or tragically charts the American evolution from innocence to disillusionment than Michael Cimino\u2019s devastating epic about working-class friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage) from a Pennsylvania steel town drafted into war. The final sing-along scene to \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d after their lives have irrevocably changed, remains a powerfully poignant gut punch.",

Shot in the Philippines and more faithful to Conrad than to Vietnam, \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d doesn\u2019t so much illuminate the chaos and moral confusion of the war as elevate it to grandiose nightmare.",
      "The 1980s saw a wave of Hollywood films about Vietnam, including \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d \u201cHamburger Hill,\u201d \u201cGood Morning Vietnam,\u201d \u201cCasualties of War\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d Foremost among them is the Oscar best picture-winning \u201cPlatoon,\u201d which Oliver Stone wrote based on his own experiences as an infantryman in Vietnam. Widely acclaimed for its realism, Stone\u2019s film remains among the most intensely vivid and visceral dramatizations of the war.",
      "Stanley Kubrick should be more often thought of as the supreme anti-war moviemaker.

Split between the harrowing boot-camp tyranny of R. Lee Ermey\u2019s drill instructor and the urban violence of the 1968 Tet Offensive, \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d fuses both ends of the war machine.",
      "How former soldiers lived with their experience in Vietnam has been a subject of many fine films, from Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d (1978) to Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d (2020).

      "A former roommate of one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers has testified the woman told her in July 2006 that the then-movie mogul had forcibly performed oral sex on her",
      "NEW YORK -- Hovering in the doorway of her roommate's bedroom one evening in July 2006, TV production assistant Miriam Haley said Harvey Weinstein \u2014 her boss \u2014 had forcibly performed oral sex on her, her then-roommate testified Thursday at the ex-movie mogul's retrial.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Miriam, that sounds like rape. I think you should call a lawyer,\u2019\u201d but a shaken Haley seemed disinclined to do so, recalled the ex-roommate, Elizabeth Entin.",
      "If secondhand, it was the first testimony jurors have gotten so far about any of the alleged sexual assaults at the heart of the retrial, which opened Wednesday. Haley and two other accusers are expected to testify later in the weekslong proceeding.",
      "Weinstein, 73, maintains that he has never sexually assaulted or raped anyone. His lawyers argue that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer in hopes of getting ahead in the entertainment business.",
      "Weinstein was transformed in 2017 from a Hollywood tycoon into the #MeToo movement's archvillain, after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public.",
      "He was convicted in 2020 of raping Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor, and sexually assaulting Haley, who worked on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway.\u201d But New York's highest court overturned his conviction last year, finding that the trial judge had allowed prejudicial testimony.",
      "The reversal led to the retrial, which includes an additional allegation of forcible oral sex on a different woman, former model Kaja Sokola. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "Entin was among the witnesses who are returning to the stand five years after testifying in the landmark #MeToo case. But prosecutors, some defense lawyers and the judge are different \u2014 and so are the contours of the testimony and evidence being elicited.",
      "For instance, this time Entin didn't give any details of what she said Haley told her about the alleged sexual assault.",
      "And Entin wasn't asked about a recollection that made for a memorable and rare light moment at the first trial \u2014 a time when she said Weinstein showed up uninvited and was chased around the women's apartment by Entin's pet Chihuahua.",
      "Farber had indicated he didn't think that having Entin describe the purported episode was fair game for the trial.",
      "In another measure of the looping trajectory of the case, Entin found herself testifying about what she has said and written about the first trial itself. The fashion startup founder and consultant has reflected on the case in a book, on podcasts and some interviews.",
      "Weinstein attorney Jennifer Bonjean confronted her with instances in which Entin referred to her participation in the first trial as her \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d and compared gearing up for testifying to preparing for battle.",
      "Entin responded tensely that being cross-examined was a form of \u201cvery civilized battle.\u201d",
      "The voluble Entin said that her writing style was sometimes \u201cmildly hyperbolic,\u201d but that she'd been describing how she girded herself for a daunting experience.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to be named. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "\u201cGomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\u201d premiered on CBS six weeks after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorized U.S. combat troops in Vietnam, and the daft comedy was among the chief images of the military in American homes through the peak of U.S. involvement in 1969. Naturally, the show about a country rube in the Marine Corps never directly mentioned the war. But most of the real-life Marines who marched in its introduction would soon be fighting in Vietnam. Star Jim Nabors later said watching that intro was difficult, knowing some of those men had died.",
      "It would take \u201cAll in the Family\u201d to bring the war into prime-time discourse. The Norman Lear-created CBS comedy owed its popularity to timely political bickering between cantankerous patriarch Archie Bunker (Carroll O\u2019Connor) and his liberal-minded son-in-law Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic (Rob Reiner). Vietnam was the sole subject of a landmark 1976 episode where a draft-dodging fugitive friend of Michael\u2019s comes to Christmas dinner, and an explosive argument ensues. \u201cWhen the hell are you going to admit that the war was wrong?!\u201d Michael shouts. A friend of Archie\u2019s whose son died in the war shocks him by taking his son-in-law\u2019s side.",
      "Set in the Korean War of the early 1950s, \u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d the CBS dramedy about wisecracking U.S. Army doctors, was among the most popular shows in the country during the Vietnam War\u2019s final years. It was heavy with anti-military, anti-war sentiment, evoking the zeitgeist of a Vietnam-exhausted populace. \u201cWar isn\u2019t Hell,\u201d Hawkeye Pierce, played by Alan Alda, says in a typical line. \u201cThere are no innocent bystanders in Hell, but war is chock full of them.\u201d (The Robert Altman film the show stemmed from deliberately minimized references to Korea to maximize its unspoken commentary on Vietnam.)",
      "Television's first regular portrayal of Vietnam veterans came in the form of a cartoonish crew of daring mercenaries that reflected the era of Reagan and Rambo. NBC\u2019s \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d whose members included a mohawked-and-gold-chained Mr. T and a cigar-chomping George Peppard, were a \u201ccrack commando unit\u201d who were innocent fugitives from military justice and worked as mercenaries pulling off weekly capers. Explosions and jumping cars abounded. In a fourth-season episode, the team returns to Vietnam for a job. Peppard\u2019s Hannibal momentarily struggles with dark war memories before getting back to the lighthearted action.",
      "HBO aired and helped organize a 1987 charity concert dubbed \u201cWelcome Home\u201d that billed itself as the warm celebration Vietnam War veterans never got upon their return. Performers included James Brown, Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Wonder. The July Fourth concert was not a militaristic affair, and had a hate-the-war, love-the-troops vibe. Some of the most anti-war songs of the \u201960s were performed by artists like John Fogerty and Crosby, Stills & Nash. The event would be a harbinger of a wave of cultural nostalgia and reckoning as baby boomers began turning 40 and were in the mood to reflect.",
      "With \u201cTour of Duty,\u201d the Vietnam War finally came to prime time. The CBS series that premiered in 1987 showed actual combat and the young men who fought and died in it. It might have been called \u201cPlatoon: The Series,\u201d after the Vietnam film that had just won best picture at the Oscars. Surprisingly gory and gritty for a network show, it had all the hallmarks of the era\u2019s many Vietnam movies. But executives seeking lower costs and higher ratings \u2014 which never came \u2014 eventually moved production from Hawaii to California and introduced romances and soapy plotlines typical of TV dramas.",
      "And suddenly, there were two Vietnam series on TV. ABC\u2019s \u201cChina Beach\u201d was part-\u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d part-\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d part-\u201cMad Men.\u201d Set in a wartime evacuation hospital \u2014 the title was the Americans\u2019 nickname for My Khe Beach in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng \u2014 it focused on Army medics and civilians. It was festooned with \u201960s songs whose copyrights have kept the series off streaming services. Beloved by critics, \u201cChina Beach\u201d made a star and a best-actress Emmy winner of Dana Delany, but never found a mass audience. With its cancellation, network TV depictions of the war would disappear for years.",
      "\u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d was baby boomer nostalgia in its purest form. The ABC series, narrated by an adult Kevin Arnold (voiced by Daniel Stern, played as a child by Fred Savage), depicts his boyhood feelings and experiences with the backing of sentimental \u201960s songs. The specter of Vietnam dominates its first season, which sees Kevin\u2019s hero \u2014 the big brother of his neighbor and crush Winnie Cooper \u2014 die in the war. In a 2021 reboot, the story shifts to a Black family in Alabama, with narrator Dean Williams\u2019 brother a returning Vietnam vet who faces racism at home.",
      "The NBC miniseries \u201cThe \u201960s\u201d was a roundup of the decade\u2019s cliches that by then had been well-established in movies and TV. The 1999 two-night event was billed as \u201cthe movie event of a generation.\u201d Its subjects were three Chicago siblings who each go on very 1960s journeys. For Jerry O\u2019Connell\u2019s high-school quarterback character, that meant serving in Vietnam. He enlists in a gung-ho moment, but by the show\u2019s second night, he\u2019s back home with an Army jacket and long hair, drinking to bury his trauma. The show drew a big audience at a time when NBC was ratings king.",
      "The time-hopping, tear-jerking NBC family drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d used the Vietnam War to delve into the psyche of Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia), who refused to talk about his experience as a soldier with his wife and kids before his premature death. In dual plotlines that run through its third season, with the emotional themes and folk-acoustic soundtrack that are hallmarks of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Jack is shown enlisting to try to protect his drafted younger brother. Decades later, his son Kevin (Justin Hartley) travels to Vietnam to find out what happened to his father and uncle.",
      "In a docuseries that ran over 10 nights on PBS, the Vietnam War got the same hallowed treatment Ken Burns brought nearly 30 years earlier to the Civil War. Burns and Lynn Novick's \u201cThe Vietnam War\" was not as soft or sentimental as his reputation might have suggested. It was a rare PBS show with a TV-MA rating, and its tone, with a modern soundtrack from composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, matched the messiness of the conflict. The show went to lengths to include a North Vietnamese perspective along with American and South Vietnamese vets and historians.",
      "It took until 2024 before a fictional television show would attempt a Vietnamese perspective of the war\u2019s end and its aftermath, though it brought mixed reactions from Vietnamese American viewers. HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d was based on Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The first two episodes of the black-comic limited series depict a harrowing flight during the fall of Saigon. Actors of Vietnamese descent played most of its main roles, including lead Hoa Xuande. But much of the attention given to it \u2014 and its only Emmy nomination \u2014 went to Robert Downey Jr. for his portrayal of four different white American men.",

      "Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to change the language in the state's abortion laws in an effort to clarify when doctors are allowed to perform an abortion during a medical emergency",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Senate approved changes Tuesday to the state\u2019s strict abortion ban that both Republicans and Democrats say would clarify medical exceptions and has drawn support from women who were told they could not end their pregnancies despite life-threatening complications.",
      "The unanimous passage of the bill in the GOP-controlled Senate \u2014 by a 31-0 vote \u2014 marked a rare moment of bipartisanship on an issue that for years has roiled the state Capitol as Texas Republicans have defended one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive abortion bans and launched criminal investigations into alleged violations.",
      "Under Senate-passed changes, Texas' ban would specify that doctors are allowed to perform an abortion if a patient is experiencing a \u201clife-threatening\u201d condition capable of causing death, and \"not necessarily one actively injuring the patient.\u201d The bill would also require doctors to receive training on the revised law.",
      "If approved by the state House and signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, the revisions would mark the first time Texas lawmakers have modified language in the near-total abortion ban since it took effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe know there are cases where moms who should have been treated were denied treatment,\u201d Republican state Sen. Bryan Hughes said on the floor of the chamber before the vote, urging lawmakers to adopt changes that make the law \"crystal clear.\u201d",
      "Texas' ban would still have no exception in cases of rape or incest and the law would not spell out specific medical exceptions, which Senate Democrats noted even as they said they would support it and predicted it would save lives.",
      "\u201cI will vote for it, but this policy is no less cruel for being made clear,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt said.",
      "Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a similar bill in March that added specific medical exceptions to the state's ban, which also prohibits all abortions except in medical emergencies. Last year, South Dakota released an instructional video for doctors to clarify the state's abortion restrictions.",
      "The Texas bill comes following years of the state's abortion ban successfully navigating court challenges and scrutiny from doctors and abortion rights advocates. The advocates say the state's laws are too vague when defining what is considered a \u201clife-threatening condition.\u201d",
      "Hughes, who is one of the architects of the state's stringent abortion ban, said he introduced the bill to \u201cremove any doubt\u201d that doctors can perform an abortion when the mother's life is at risk.",
      "Texas law currently prohibits all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest, except in instances to save the life of the mother. Physicians can face up to 99 years in prison and be fined up to $100,000 if they perform an illegal abortion.",
      "Several women challenged existing medical exceptions under Texas law as too narrow. They called the new legislation a small step in the right direction and would allow doctors to act more urgently. Kaitlyn Kash, who was denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications, said at a news conference this month that she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the bill.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court in 2024 said that the state's abortion laws were not too vague, ruling against several women who were denied an abortion after experiencing serious pregnancy complications. The Texas Medical Board also declined to list specific medical exceptions allowed under the law.",
      "In March, Texas filed criminal charges against a Houston midwife for allegedly providing illegal abortions, and the state is also suing a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida is poised to ban fluoride in public drinking water, over the concerns of dentists and public health advocates who say the mineral is a safe, effective way to protect people of all ages from developing cavities.",
      "Florida lawmakers gave final approval to the bill Tuesday. The measure now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose administration has advocated against the fluoridation of community water systems, arguing high levels could pose a risk to children\u2019s intellectual development.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water is considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "\u201cAs dentists, we see the direct consequences fluoride removal has on our patients and it\u2019s a real tragedy when policymakers\u2019 decisions hurt vulnerable kids and adults in the long term,\u201d Brett Kessler, president of the American Dental Association, said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cBlindly calling for a ban on fluoridated water hurts people, costs money, and will ultimately harm our economy.\u201d",
      "While Florida's bill doesn't specifically reference fluoride, it will require the mineral and some other additives be removed from water sources across the state, said bill sponsor Republican state Rep. Kaylee Tuck.",
      "\u201cAnything that relates to water quality, removing contaminants, things like that, we're not touching that,\" Tuck said. \"It's anything that has to do with health. So fluoride, vitamins, whatever else it is.\u201d",
      "Utah became the first state to pass a ban last month, approving legislation that bars cities and communities from deciding whether to add the mineral to their water systems.",
      "Fluoride has come under increased scrutiny under the influence of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is setting the gears of government in motion to stop fluoridating water.",
      "Some local officials in Florida have already voted to remove the mineral from their community water systems, ahead of state lawmakers' push to ban fluoride.",
      "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Tuesday she is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the passage of the bill, adding that it disregards \u201cthe overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health.\u201d",
      "Levine Cava said that ending fluoridation, which is a safe and cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay, will have \u201clong-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "The mayor said the decision should be left to local communities.",
      "About one-third of community water systems, serving more than 60% of the U.S. population, fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 analysis by the CDC.",

      "Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska overwhelmingly approved paid sick leave laws last year",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska were asked last year whether they wanted to require employers to provide paid sick leave to their workers. They overwhelmingly said yes.",
      "Now some lawmakers in each of those states are trying to roll back the benefits, citing concerns from businesses about costs.",
      "The efforts mark the latest attempt by legislators to alter laws backed by the voters they represent. In February, for example, Michigan enacted revisions to a paid sick leave law initiated by voters seven years ago, delaying the date when small businesses must comply and allowing a longer period before new employees are eligible.",
      "Though some voters are outraged, some lawmakers contend that citizen activists who crafted the initiatives overlooked the realities of running a business.",
      "Restaurant owner Tim Hart, who employs about two dozen workers at his steakhouse in Hannibal, Missouri, said the paid sick leave requirement imposes a double financial hit because he must pay one person to stay home and another to fill the shift.",
      "\u201cWhen this goes into effect, we very likely won\u2019t survive,\u201d said Hart, who has urged the state Senate to halt the law.",
      "The paid sick leave laws are set to kick in Thursday in Missouri, July 1 in Alaska and Oct. 1 in Nebraska.",
      "McDonald's restaurant worker Richard Eiker is among those who stand to benefit. He signed a petition putting the initiative on the Missouri ballot and traveled recently from Kansas City to the state Capitol to lobby lawmakers to let the law stand.",
      "In 40 years on the job, Eiker has never received paid sick leave \u2014 not even when he was struggling with a kidney stone.",
      "\u201cI just took some pain medication and just went into work anyway and just worked past the pain,\u201d Eiker said. \u201cIt would have been nice to have stayed home.\u201d",
      "Federal law requires many employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for personal or family medical issues. But there is no federal mandate to pay for sick days.",
      "Nonetheless, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, according to the Department of Labor. Part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than their full-time counterparts. And just 58% of employees in the bottom quarter of income earners received paid sick leave, compared with 94% in the top quartile.",
      "Though still discretionary for many employers, the number of states mandating paid sick leave has grown significantly since Connecticut enacted the first such law in 2012. Last year's ballot measures raised the total to 18 states and the District of Columbia. Three additional states require paid leave for any reason, without specifying sickness.",
      "Many paid sick leave laws, including the ones in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska, apply to any employer with at least one worker. But some states exempt the smallest businesses, with cutoffs ranging from five to 25 employees. The number of annual paid sick days also varies.",
      "On Tuesday the state Supreme Court upheld Missouri's paid sick leave law against a challenge from business groups. But efforts to revise it continue.",
      "In March, Republican House members passed legislation to repeal the paid sick leave requirement. That was then blocked by minority-party Democrats in the Senate. So Republicans are pushing an alternative that would delay the law until later this year, exempt smaller businesses and take away workers' ability to sue over alleged violations.",
      "The intent is to \u201cjust make it a little less onerous on employers,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Mike Bernskoetter, a small business owner who is backing the bill.",
      "But many workers already have it tough, Democratic lawmakers said.",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s people living paycheck to paycheck, just missing a little bit of work can really put them behind,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Patty Lewis said.",
      "Legislation pushed by Republican lawmakers in Nebraska state would carve out exceptions from paid sick leave for 14- and-15-year-old employees, temporary and seasonal agricultural workers and businesses with 10 or fewer employees.",
      "The legislation also would strip workers of the ability to sue employers who retaliate against them for using paid sick leave.",
      "Supporters of the revisions say they aim to protect small businesses from higher costs. Opponents say they are essentially gutting the law.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking about just whole swaths of the ballot language being stricken by this,\u201d state Sen. John Cavanaugh said during recent debate. \u201cThat is a huge overstep by this Legislature to say that we know better than the people who voted for this.\u201d",
      "A bill by state Rep. Justin Ruffridge would exempt seasonal workers and businesses with fewer than 50 employees from the sick leave requirement. That could exclude many catering to Alaska's summer tourists.",
      "Ruffridge, a member of the House\u2019s Republican minority, said small business owners should be able to choose whether to spend money on sick leave benefits or other measures to grow their businesses.",
      "Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, which supported the ballot measure, doubts Ruffridge\u2019s bill will gain traction in the final weeks of this year's session.",

      "The Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by strict drinking water standards for forever chemicals set last year",
      "In pain so bad he couldn\u2019t stand, Chris Meek was rushed to the hospital with a life-threatening ruptured gallbladder. When he emerged from surgery, he learned he had kidney cancer that thankfully hadn\u2019t yet spread.",
      "Meek, a social studies teacher in Wilmington, North Carolina, was 47 at the time. But he remained confused for years about why, as someone seemingly not at risk, he had gotten cancer until Emily Donovan, a parent of students at his school, gave a guest talk about high levels of harmful forever chemicals known as PFAS in North Carolina's environment. When Donovan mentioned kidney cancer, the possible cause of Meek's diagnosis finally clicked.",
      "Until then, Meek said, he \u201chad no idea what PFAS was.\u201d",
      "Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency set the first federal drinking water limits for PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, finding they increased the risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers and babies being born with low birth weight.",
      "In a decision with consequences for tens of millions of Americans, the Trump administration is expected to soon say whether it intends to stand by those strict standards and defend the limits against a water utility industry challenge in federal court.",
      "In North Carolina, runoff from a Chemours plant contaminated the Cape Fear River, creating a crisis for cities like Wilmington that use it for drinking water. Amid public outcry, Wilmington effectively eliminated it from tap water.",
      "Other U.S. communities \u2014 often near military bases or industrial sites \u2014 did the same when test results were frightening and public pressure, local leadership or state law forced PFAS-laden wells offline or prompted installation of expensive filtering systems, according to Mark White, drinking water global practice leader at the engineering firm CDM Smith.",
      "The EPA said the PFAS found in North Carolina, often called GenX chemicals, can be toxic to the kidney. While other types of PFAS may raise kidney cancer risk, little research has focused on the link between kidney cancer and GenX, according to Sue Fenton, director of the Center for Human Health and the Environment at North Carolina State University. Chemours said evidence doesn't support arguments that GenX at low levels is a health threat. The company has sharply reduced PFAS discharges.",
      "So far, sampling has found nearly 12% of U.S. water utilities are above the recently set EPA limits, but most aren't above by much. Forcing this group to reduce PFAS more than doubles the rule\u2019s health benefits but roughly triples its costs, the EPA has said.",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s rule set standards for two common types of PFAS at 4 parts per trillion, effectively the lowest level at which they can be reliably detected. Standards for several other PFAS chemicals were set, too, and utilities must meet those levels by 2029.",
      "Manufactured by companies like Chemours and 3M, PFAS were incredibly useful in many applications -\u2013 among them, helping clothes to withstand rain and ensuring that firefighting foam snuffed out flames. But the chemicals also accumulate in the body. As science advanced in recent years, evidence of harm at far lower levels became clearer.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has championed fossil fuels and the rollback of major clean air and water rules. His history with PFAS is more nuanced; during his time as a New York congressman, he supported legislation to regulate forever chemicals in drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an issue that touches people in a very tangible way across the political spectrum, including in Lee Zeldin\u2019s former district,\" said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group.",
      "Zeldin has offered clues about what the EPA could do. The agency estimated the rule would cost about $1.5 billion annually and Zeldin said recently that communities struggling to afford a fix for PFAS that are just above the standard might be handled differently than wealthy places with lots of it.",
      "\u201cWhat we are going to have to be is extremely thoughtful in figuring this out,\u201d he said.",
      "On Monday, the EPA said it will establish an agency lead for PFAS, develop wastewater limits for PFAS manufacturers and investigate sources that pose an immediate danger to drinking water, among other actions.",
      "Soon, the EPA must tell a federal appeals court in Washington whether the rule should stand or be rewritten, although weakening it could be complicated because the Safe Drinking Water Act prevents new rules from being looser than previous ones. The agency could, however, encourage exemptions and deadline extensions, according to Erik Olson, an attorney with the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council supporting the current standards in the court case.",
      "Consider Avondale, Arizona, outside of Phoenix, which produces PFAS results modestly above the limits. Officials have done detailed testing and are planning to enhance water treatment. All told, lowering PFAS may cost Avondale more than $120 million, according to Kirk Beaty, the city\u2019s public utility director.",
      "That\u2019s money a city like Avondale \u201cjust doesn\u2019t have sitting in a back room somewhere,\" Beaty said, adding he\u2019ll defer to federal experts to dictate what\u2019s acceptable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping we\u2019re a little further ahead of everybody else. If the regulation changes, well you know, we may let off the gas a little bit, we may not,\u201d he said, adding that it is hard to justify spending extra money to do more than what\u2019s required when the cost falls on residents.",
      "If the government decides higher amounts of PFAS are acceptable, that could confuse people, especially in areas where the public is already concerned.",
      "\u201cIf we enter into a gray area over what\u2019s healthy and what\u2019s not healthy, then utilities are at risk of being caught up in a debate for which they have no real responsibility nor expertise to decide on,\u201d said Karine Roug\u00e9, CEO for municipal water at Veolia North America, a water operations company.",
      "The American Water Works Association, an industry group, filed the court challenge to the new rule. It agrees that certain PFAS should be regulated but argues the EPA\u2019s standards go too far, underestimate costs and are \u201cneither feasible nor cost-effective.\u201d There are serious consequences for residents' water bills, it says.",
      "The burden of complying will fall heavily on small utilities that can least afford it. Many water providers already struggle to maintain their existing infrastructure, some experts say. On top of everything else, they face new requirements to replace lead pipes. The AWWA wants the EPA to extend the PFAS and lead deadlines by two years.",
      "There is money available to help. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $9 billion for chemicals like PFAS and utilities have won multibillion-dollar settlements against PFAS polluters that help as well.",
      "Meek, who successfully recovered after surgery from cancer and is now 59, is planning to sue over his illness. He once didn\u2019t second-guess using tap water. Now he reaches for bottled water.",
      "Donovan, who introduced Meek to PFAS and helped start Clean Cape Fear, says if the government\u2019s standards are weakened, it\u2019ll relieve pressure on utilities to effectively treat the water.",
      "Previously, \u201cour local utilities could tell us publicly that the water met or exceeded all state and federal guidelines because there weren\u2019t any,\u201d she said.",

      "A woman pleaded not guilty Monday to fatally stabbing a Kansas City, Missouri, paramedic as she was being taken to a hospital in an ambulance.",
      "Shanetta Bossell, 39, was arrested Sunday after trying to drive off in the ambulance as others were tending to paramedic Graham Hoffman's chest wound, according to court records. She has been jailed on $1 million bond on charges of first-degree murder, armed criminal action, assault and resisting arrest. No attorney is listed for her in online court records.",
      "The 29-year-old paramedic had worked for the Kansas City Fire Department for three years and was remembered for his commitment to the job.",
      "\u201cOur community grieves his loss at such a young age with his entire life ahead of him,\u201d Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson said at a news conference Sunday night.",
      "Police spotted Bossell walking along the shoulder of a highway early Sunday, her finger cut and bleeding, according to the probable cause affidavit. She had been freed on bond just two days earlier in a resisting arrest case that Thompson said involved an assault on a law enforcement officer.",
      "While en route to the hospital, the driver heard Hoffman frantically call for help, saying Bossell had a knife. The driver stopped and then rushed to the back. As he flung open the door, he heard Hoffman say, \"She stabbed me in the heart,\u201d the affidavit said.",
      "An officer who was following the ambulance then witnessed Bossell get into the vehicle's cab and attempt to put it into drive, according to the affidavit. The officer ultimately was able to wrestle her to the ground. But during the fray, she bit his arm, and he hit her in the head with his firearm to get her to let go, the affidavit said.",

      "The Vietnam War ended 50 years ago but the disaster unleashed by American use of Agent Orange continues unabated",
      "DA NANG, Vietnam -- The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975, when the South Vietnamese capital of Saigon fell to Communist forces. But millions of people still face daily battles with its chemical legacy.",
      "Nguyen Thanh Hai, 34, is one of millions with disabilities linked to Agent Orange. Born with severe developmental challenges, it's a struggle for him to complete tasks others take for granted: buttoning the blue shirt he wears to a special school in Da Nang, practicing the alphabet, drawing shapes or forming simple sentences.",
      "Hai grew up in Da Nang, the site of a U.S. air base where departing troops left behind huge amounts of Agent Orange that have lingered for decades, leeching into food and water supplies in areas like Hai's village and affecting generations of residents.",
      "Across Vietnam, U.S. forces sprayed sprayed 72 million liters (19 million gallons) of defoliants during the war to strip the enemy's cover. More than half was Agent Orange, a blend of herbicides.",
      "Agent Orange was laced with dioxin, a type of chemical linked to cancer, birth defects and lasting environmental damage. Today, 3 million people, including many children, still suffer serious health issues associated with exposure to it.",
      "Vietnam has spent decades cleaning up the toxic legacy of the war, in part funded by belated U.S. assistance, but the work is far from complete. Now, millions in Vietnam are worried that the U.S. may abandon Agent Orange cleanup as President Donald Trump slashes foreign aid.",
      "When the war ended, the U.S. turned its back on Vietnam, eager to turn the page on a painful chapter in its history.",
      "But Vietnam was left with dozens of dioxin hotspots spread across 58 of its 63 provinces.",
      "Vietnam says the health impacts last generations, threatening the children, grandchildren, and even great-grandchildren of people exposed to the chemicals with health complications ranging from cancer to birth defects that affects the spine and nervous system.",
      "But the science about the human health impact \u2014 both to those exposed to Agent Orange and the generations that follow \u2014 remains unsettled. This is partly because when the two countries finally started working together in 2006, they focused on finding dioxin in the environment and clearing it instead of studying the still-contentious topic of its impact on human health, said Charles Bailey, co-author of the book \u201cFrom Enemies to Partners: Vietnam, the U.S. and Agent Orange.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe science of causality is still incomplete,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "Vietnam identifies Agent Orange victims by checking family history, where they lived, and a list of health problems linked to the poison. And Hai's disabilities were very likely linked to the spraying of the defoliant, added Bailey.",
      "The 34-year-old dreams of becoming a soldier like his grandfather, was unable to leave home for years, waiting alone while his family went out to work. It was only five years ago that he began attending a special school. \u201cI am happy here because I have many friends,\u201d he said. Other students at the school hope to become tailors or makers of incense sticks.",
      "The contamination also denuded Vietnam\u2019s natural defenses. Nearly half of its mangrove trees, which shield shores from strong storms, were destroyed. Much of its tropical forest was irrevocably damaged, while the herbicide also leached the soil of nutrients in some of Vietnam\u2019s most climate-vulnerable areas.",
      "In the decades after the war ended, the recovering country fenced off heavily contaminated sites like Da Nang airport and began providing support to impacted families.",
      "But the U.S. largely ignored growing evidence of health impacts \u2014 including on its own veterans \u2014 until the mid-2000s, when it and began funding cleanup in Vietnam. In 1991, the U.S. recognized that certain diseases could be related to exposure to Agent Orange and made veterans who had them eligible for benefits.",
      "Since 1991, it has spent over $155 million to aid people with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange or littered by unexploded bombs, according to the U.S. State Department. The two countries have also cooperated to recover war dead, with the U.S. aiding Vietnam\u2019s search for its own missing.",
      "Cleaning up Agent Orange is expensive and often dangerous. Heavily polluted soil needs to be unearthed and heated in large ovens to very high temperatures, while less contaminated soil can be buried in secure landfills.",
      "Despite years of work, large sites still need to cleared. In Da Nang, where an air base was contaminated during storage and transportation of Agent Orange, the U.S. completed a $110 million cleanup in 2018 but an area the size of 10 soccer fields still remains heavily contaminated.",
      "Cooperation on war legacy issues also laid a foundation for growing U.S.-Vietnam ties, culminating in 2023 when Vietnam elevated the U.S. to its highest diplomatic status of comprehensive strategic partner.",
      "\u201cThe United States considers Vietnam a key partner in advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific,\u201d former U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in Vietnam in 2023.",
      "But Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to USAID stalled key projects in Vietnam, and while many have resumed, doubts remain about U.S. reliability.",
      "Vietnam now has to negotiate a new reality where the U.S. president says the country can no longer afford to help other countries.",
      "The country can\u2019t handle the toxic chemicals that still persist without help, said Nguyen Van An, the chairman of Association for Victims of Agent Orange in Danang. \u201cWe always believe that the U.S. government and the manufacturers of this toxic chemical must have the responsibility to support the victims,\u201d he said.",
      "He said he hoped that any stoppages to ongoing projects due to shifting politics in Washington would be temporary.",
      "Insufficient data means that experts can't definitely say when the risk to human health will end. But the more urgent problem is if that cleanup efforts are interrupted, the now-exposed contaminated soil could get into waterways and harm more people.",
      "A 10-year project to clear the some 500,000 cubic meters (650,000 cubic yards) of dioxin-contaminated soil \u2014 enough to fill 40,000 trucks \u2014 at Bien Hoa airbase was launched in 2020. It stopped for a week in March and then restarted.",
      "But Bailey, who worked on issues related to the Agent Orange in Vietnam for years, said future USAID funding for the cleanup and a $30 million program for people with disabilities was uncertain.",
      "With federal cuts to USAID, most staffers in Vietnam are expected to be gone by later this year, leaving nobody to administer funding for remediation programs, even if it is not cut itself.",
      "\u201cThis basically leaves a very large mountain of contaminated soil. Only 30% of which has been dealt with and that is less contaminated,\u201d said Bailey.",
      "He added that less than half of the soil at Bien Hoa had been treated and much of the remaining soil was heavily contaminated and needed to be treated in an as-yet unbuilt incinerator.",
      "Tim Rieser, who was retired Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2019s foreign policy aide when the Vermont Democrat secured the original funding for Vietnam War remediation projects and is now a senior advisor to Sen. Peter Welch, said Congress still supports the programs but it would be hard for them to continue without staff.",
      "\"For more than 30 years, the U.S. and Vietnam have worked together to rebuild relations by dealing with the worst legacies of the war, like Agent Orange,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the Trump administration is mindlessly shutting everything down, with no concern for the impact of their actions on relations with an important partner in the Indo-Pacific.\u201d",
      "The U.S. embassy in Hanoi didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Chuck Searcy, an American Vietnam War veteran who has worked on humanitarian programs in the country since 1995, said he worries that trust built over years could erode very rapidly. He pointed out that those who benefit from U.S. funded projects to address war legacies are \u201cinnocent victims.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been victimized twice, once by the war and the consequences that they\u2019ve suffered. And now by having the rug pulled out from under them,\u201d he said.",

      "Colombia's capital has South America\u2019s only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses and now a topic of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which has been taking place since Sunday in Bogota",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- The left arm of Christian Camilo Amaya is tattooed with a skull pierced by a syringe, which he says represents the use of cocaine and heroin. He frequently shot up on streets of Bogota, but he has recently switched to South America's only supervised room for drug use, aimed at reducing harm and preventing overdoses.",
      "Non-profit organization Accion Tecnica Social runs the supervised room named Cambie (or Change in English) in Colombia's capital. Since it opened in June 2023, 14 users had their overdoses treated with injections of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses. The last such case was a year ago.",
      "Amaya often carries a black plastic bag with more than a dozen used syringes, which he puts in a red container for biological waste, as protocols for using the room dictate. He denies being addicted to heroin, but argues the supervised room gives him syringes and training on hygienic injections and overdose prevention.",
      "\u201cI know what substances do to me, so I know I shouldn\u2019t be a frequent user for that very reason, to avoid becoming addicted,\u201d Amaya told The Associated Press in the unmarked drug use room in one of the city\u2019s impoverished neighborhoods.",
      "The initiative is one of the topics of the International Conference on Harm Reduction, which started Sunday in Bogota. It is the first time the conference has been held in Latin America in the past three decades, as the leftist administration of President Gustavo Petro pushes for a revision in the international drug control system of the United Nations.",
      "The supervised consumption room currently has 87 registered users, 26% of whom are Venezuelan migrants, who come to inject themselves or receive syringes, food, guidance on lower-risk injection techniques, or overdose management.",
      "Of the users who come to the room, 91% use heroin, 7% inject cocaine, and less than 2% use speedballs, a mixture of cocaine and heroin. Official data on heroin use in Colombia is scarce.",
      "The project was born in 2022 when organizers started contacting users directly to identify their needs. It received technical advice from other countries, especially Mexico.",
      "For David Moreno, who works at Cambie, the most difficult part of reversing an overdose is not injecting the naloxone but avoiding a follow-up overdose.",
      "\u201cOnce I had a user who would get very violent when she came back from an overdose. She would start hurting herself, then she would take off my jacket and tie it, and I\u2019d have to restrain her,\u201d said Moreno.",
      "\u201cWhen it happens, I am calm. But when the user leaves... Wow, my adrenaline rushes.\u201d",
      "Sam Rivera, the executive-director of OnPoint, a nonprofit organization in New York City that operates supervised injection centers, toured the small, nearly 65-foot room with three patient cubicles before AP's visit.",
      "\u201cI look at it as a mini version of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Rivera said. He argues the initiative is also good for public security.",
      "\u201cI always tell people to come visit an overdose prevention center. When you hear about it, it sounds dangerous or it sounds bad because it sounds like you\u2019re enabling people to use,\" he added. \u201cThese are people who are going to use. So instead of using outside, in danger, leaving these supplies in the street, everything happens inside, everything stays inside.\u201d",

      "U.S. health officials are pushing to get artificial colors out of the nation's food supply",
      "ST. LOUIS -- As pressure grows to get artificial colors out of the U.S. food supply, the shift may well start at Abby Tampow\u2019s laboratory desk.",
      "On an April afternoon, the scientist hovered over tiny dishes of red dye, each a slightly different ruby hue. Her task? To match the synthetic shade used for years in a commercial bottled raspberry vinaigrette \u2014 but by using only natural ingredients.",
      "\u201cWith this red, it needs a little more orange,\u201d Tampow said, mixing a slurry of purplish black carrot juice with a bit of beta-carotene, an orange-red color made from algae.",
      "Tampow is part of the team at Sensient Technologies Corp., one of the world\u2019s largest dyemakers, that is rushing to help the salad dressing manufacturer \u2014 along with thousands of other American businesses \u2014 meet demands to overhaul colors used to brighten products from cereals to sports drinks.",
      "\u201cMost of our customers have decided that this is finally the time when they\u2019re going to make that switch to a natural color,\u201d said Dave Gebhardt, Sensient\u2019s senior technical director. He joined a recent tour of the Sensient Colors factory in a north St. Louis neighborhood.",
      "Last week, U.S. health officials announced plans to persuade food companies to voluntarily eliminate petroleum-based artificial dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. called them \u201cpoisonous compounds\u201d that endanger children\u2019s health and development, citing limited evidence of potential health risks.",
      "The federal push follows a flurry of state laws and a January decision to ban the artificial dye known as Red 3 \u2014 found in cakes, candies and some medications \u2014 because of cancer risks in lab animals. Social media influencers and ordinary consumers have ramped up calls for artificial colors to be removed from foods.",
      "The FDA allows about three dozen color additives, including eight remaining synthetic dyes. But making the change from the petroleum-based dyes to colors derived from vegetables, fruits, flowers and even insects won\u2019t be easy, fast or cheap, said Monica Giusti, an Ohio State University food color expert.",
      "\u201cStudy after study has shown that if all companies were to remove synthetic colors from their formulations, the supply of the natural alternatives would not be enough,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cWe are not really ready.\u201d",
      "It can take six months to a year to convert a single product from a synthetic dye to a natural one. And it could require three to four years to build up the supply of botanical products necessary for an industrywide shift, Sensient officials said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s 150 million pounds of beet juice sitting around waiting on the off chance the whole market may convert,\u201d said Paul Manning, the company's chief executive. \u201cTens of millions of pounds of these products need to be grown, pulled out of the ground, extracted.\u201d",
      "To make natural dyes, Sensient works with farmers and producers around the world to harvest the raw materials, which typically arrive at the plant as bulk concentrates. They\u2019re processed and blended into liquids, granules or powders and then sent to food companies to be added to final products.",
      "Natural dyes are harder to make and use than artificial colors. They are less consistent in color, less stable and subject to changes related to acidity, heat and light, Manning said. Blue is especially difficult. There aren't many natural sources of the color and those that exist can be hard to maintain during processing.",
      "Also, a natural color costs about 10 times more to make than the synthetic version, Manning estimated.",
      "\u201cHow do you get that same vividness, that same performance, that same level of safety in that product as you would in a synthetic product?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complexity associated with that.\u201d",
      "Companies have long used the Red 3 synthetic dye to create what Sensient officials describe as \u201cthe Barbie pink.\u201d",
      "To create that color with a natural source might require the use of cochineal, an insect about the size of a peppercorn.",
      "The female insects release a vibrant red pigment, carminic acid, in their bodies and eggs. The bugs live only on prickly pear cactuses in Peru and elsewhere. About 70,000 cochineal insects are needed to produce 1 kilogram, about 2.2 pounds, of dye.",
      "\u201cIt's interesting how the most exotic colors are found in the most exotic places,\u201d said Norb Norbrega, who travels the world scouting new hues for Sensient.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. About 1 in 5 food products in the U.S. contains added colors, whether natural or synthetic, Manning estimated. Many contain multiple colors.",
      "FDA requires a sample of each batch of synthetic colors to be submitted for testing and certification. Color additives derived from plant, animal or mineral sources are exempt, but have been evaluated by the agency.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that the approved dyes are safe when used according to regulations and that \u201cmost children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "But critics note that added colors are a key component of ultraprocessed foods, which account for more than 70% of the U.S. diet and have been associated with a host of chronic health problems, including heart disease, diabetes and obesity.",
      "\u201cI am all for getting artificial food dyes out of the food supply,\u201d said Marion Nestle, a food policy expert. \u201cThey are strictly cosmetic, have no health or safety purpose, are markers of ultraprocessed foods and may be harmful to some children.\u201d",
      "Color is powerful driver of consumer behavior and changes can backfire, Giusti noted. In 2016, food giant General Mills removed artificial dyes from Trix cereal after requests from consumers, switching to natural sources including turmeric, strawberries and radishes.",
      "But the cereal lost its neon colors, resulting in more muted hues \u2014 and a consumer backlash. Trix fans said they missed the bright colors and familiar taste of the cereal. In 2017, the company switched back.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s a product you already love, that you\u2019re used to consuming, and it changes slightly, then it may not really be the same experience,\u201d Giusti said. \u201cAnnouncing a regulatory change is one step, but then the implementation is another thing.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, the health secretary, said U.S. officials have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d with food companies to phase out artificial colors. Industry officials told The Associated Press that there is no formal agreement.",
      "However, several companies have said they plan to accelerate a shift to natural colors in some of their products.",
      "PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said most of its products are already free of artificial colors, and that its Lays and Tostitos brands will phase them out by the end of this year. He said the company plans to phase out artificial colors \u2014 or at least offer consumers a natural alternative \u2014 over the next few years.",
      "Representatives for General Mills said they\u2019re \u201ccommitted to continuing the conversation\u201d with the administration. WK Kellogg officials said they are reformulating cereals used in the nation\u2019s school lunch programs to eliminate the artificial dyes and will halt any new products containing them starting next January.",
      "Sensient officials wouldn\u2019t confirm which companies are seeking help making the switch, but they said they\u2019re ready for the surge.",
      "\u201cNow that there\u2019s a date, there\u2019s the timeline,\u201d Manning said. \u201cIt certainly requires action.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Reeling from drug overdose deaths and scenes of people smoking fentanyl on sidewalks, San Francisco moved closer Thursday to adopting a \u201crecovery first\u201d drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal, a proposal that has prompted heated debate in the city that pioneered harm reduction.",
      "Opponents of Supervisor Matt Dorsey's proposal say its emphasis on stopping drug use alienates those who are not ready to quit, while proponents say the city has been far too permissive and making drug use safer does not help break the cycle of addiction.",

      "\u201cNo one dies from harm reduction,\u201d Patt Denning said. \u201cPeople die from conventional abstinence-based treatments because they\u2019re either left out or kicked out if they don\u2019t comply with abstinence.\u201d",
      "Brendan Harris, who said he has been clean for six years, countered that harm reduction tactics cannot go on forever and people need a firm if compassionate push into treatment.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep enabling drugs over and over again,\u201d he said.",
      "In recent years San Francisco's public health department advised people who use drugs to do so with friends to try to prevent overdose deaths. Critics said that sent the wrong message.",
      "Mayor Daniel Lurie, who took office in January, has vowed to solve the city's fentanyl crisis. Last year more than 600 people died from accidental overdoses.",
      "He ordered city-funded nonprofits to offer treatment or counseling options before giving out certain paraphernalia such as foil and pipes, and they will no longer be allowed to distribute those items in parks and on sidewalks.",
      "As amended, Dorsey's proposal states that the \u201clong-term remission of substance use disorders for individuals, with the help of fully supported and staffed evidence-based recovery and behavioral health services, shall be the primary goal.\u201d",
      "It also defines recovery as \u201cthe process by which an individual suffering from substance use disorder strives to make positive changes that become part of a voluntarily adopted healthy lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Dorsey said aspiring to live a healthy life free from illicit drug use should not be a controversial goal, and abstention can mean receiving methadone as part of a medication assisted treatment program. San Francisco offers an array of services to help people addicted to drugs, but many residents only see the free foil and pipes, he said.",
      "\u201cWe're losing the battle on harm reduction when people think that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said after the hearing.",
      "The San Francisco Marin Medical Society, which represents more than 3,500 physicians, proposed the amendments.",
      "The full Board of Supervisors votes on the proposal next month. It is expected to pass, with seven of the 11 members sponsoring or cosponsoring.",

      "The Agriculture Department says it is withdrawing a plan to limit salmonella bacteria in poultry products",
      "The Agriculture Department will not require poultry companies to limit salmonella bacteria in their products, halting a Biden Administration effort to prevent food poisoning from contaminated meat.",
      "The department on Thursday said it was withdrawing a rule proposed in August after three years of development. Officials with the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service cited feedback from more than 7,000 public comments and said they would \u201cevaluate whether it should update\u201d current salmonella regulations.",
      "The rule would have required poultry companies to keep levels of salmonella bacteria under a certain threshold and test for the presence of six strains most associated with illness, including three found in turkey and three in chicken. If the levels exceeded the standard or any of those strains were found, the poultry couldn\u2019t be sold and would be subject to recall, the proposal had said.",
      "The plan aimed to reduce an estimated 125,000 salmonella infections from chicken and 43,000 from turkey each year, according to USDA. Overall, salmonella causes 1.35 million infections a year, most through food, and about 420 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The withdrawal drew praise from the National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, which said the proposed rule was legally unsound, misinterpreted science, would have increased costs and create more food waste, all \u201cwith no meaningful impact on public health.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to further reducing salmonella and fully support food safety regulations and policies that are based on sound science,\u201d said Ashley Peterson, the group's senior vice president of science and regulatory affairs.",
      "But the move drew swift criticism from food safety advocates, including Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who helped draft the plan.",
      "The withdrawal \"sends the clear message that the Make America Healthy Again initiative does not care about the thousands of people who get sick from preventable foodborne salmonella infections linked to poultry,\" Eskin said in a statement.",
      "The proposed rule had been regarded as a food safety victory similar to a 1994 decision to ban certain strains of dangerous E. coli bacteria from ground beef after deadly outbreaks, said Sarah Sorscher, of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Shipping more salmonella to restaurants and grocery stores is certain to make Americans sicker,\u201d Sorscher said.",
      "Earlier this month, the USDA said it would delay by six months the enforcement of a final rule regulating salmonella levels in certain breaded and stuffed raw chicken products. Enforcement, which was set for May 1, now begins Nov. 3.",
      "That covers foods such as frozen chicken cordon bleu and chicken Kiev dishes that appear to be fully cooked but are only heat-treated to set the batter or coating. Such products have been linked to at least 14 salmonella outbreaks and at least 200 illnesses since 1998, according to the CDC.",

      "With the world awash in stress and anxiety, nature can be the perfect spring antidote",
      "HALLE, Belgium -- Gilles Gui was looking for the magical purple bluebells that raise their heads each spring under the budding beech leaves of the Hallerbos forest, an annual explosion of color that draws crowds from around the world.",
      "And in these times full of stress and anxiety about wars, economic threats and other tensions, he found something else too: a sense of tranquility.",
      "\u201cI notice that there\u2019s a lot of silence in my head when I\u2019m done,\u201d Gui said. \u201cYeah, it helps me keep some peace in my mind, really just take my mind away from everything that\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "Spending time in nature, experts have long said, can be a balm in troubled times.",
      "\u201cFrom a stroll through a city park to a day spent hiking in the wilderness, exposure to nature has been linked to a host of benefits, including improved attention, lower stress, better mood, reduced risk of psychiatric disorders, and even upticks in empathy and cooperation,\u201d a 2020 article of the American Psychological Association said.",
      "\u201cThese are extraordinary times,\u201d said Ignace Glorieux, a sociology professor at Brussels University, adding that the under-30 generation in particular is under pressure.",
      "\u201cThis is also the generation maybe that suffered most from the COVID crisis,\u201d Glorieux said. \u201cAnd now they come into a situation where there\u2019s a lot of international uncertainty. So especially this group, maybe more than (the older) generation, is suffering from that and feels very uncertain about their future.\u201d",
      "Gui, 26, knows what Glorieux is talking about. \u201cI do know of people my age who are worried and also with financial situations going on, who try to keep level heads, but it\u2019s very hard for them,\u201d he said.",
      "During the pandemic, the bluebell woods were closed off for fear that throngs of people would make it a hive of transmission instead of a haven of peace. Restrictions kept some parks under seal and mandated masks in some others.",
      "\u201cIt was a difficult period for everyone,\u201d said Mark Demesmaeker, a former member of the European Parliament, gardening enthusiast and city councilor in Halle, where he has walked the woods for decades. Now, at least, nature is there to welcome those with anxious minds.",
      "\u201cThese bluebells \u2014 but in other times of year as well, walking here, the forest valleys, the wildlife, the forest streams \u2014 you know, they work into your mind all year round. And it\u2019s really a big green hug that you get here,\u201d Demesmaeker said.",
      "That hug from nature is just about everywhere right now. Japan is awash in a sea of cherry blossoms, which mesmerize people around the world. Bluebell season also coincides with the prime tulip season in the Netherlands. The renowned Keukenhof garden there has become a playground for influencers and those seeking that ultimate selfie.",
      "The Keukenhof and the Dutch tourism board suggest good spots to \u201cmake your image come alive.\u201d",
      "To Glorieux, that's where 21st-century humans push it too far.",
      "\u201cWe have to be busy all the time, even in our leisure time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to perform.\"",
      "Instead, he advised, \u201cFocus! If you go out walking, focus on walking. If you go out jogging, focus only on jogging.\u201d",
      "Such advice was not wasted on Philippe Thiry, 64, a southern Belgian recently retired and ready to embrace the rest of his life. He had no phone as he set off in the sunshine to look for bluebells.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to use it here because I\u2019m here just to relax,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, just to see the flowers and to see, to listen to the birds.\u201d",

      "CAIRO -- The World Food Program and the United Nations refugee agency will slash jobs because of funding cuts, mainly from the United States, officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday, warning the reductions will severely affect aid programs worldwide.",
      "The WFP, also a United Nations organization, is expected to cut up to 30% of its staff. The head of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it would downsize its headquarters and regional offices to reduce costs by 30% and cut senior-level positions by 50%.",

      "The cuts to the U.N. agencies underscore the impact of President Donald Trump's decision to pull back the U.S. from its position as the world's single largest aid donor. Trump has given billionaire ally Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency power to redo the scale of the federal government, with a focus on slashing foreign assistance. Even before the administration's move, many donor nations had reduced humanitarian spending, and U.N. agencies struggled to reach funding goals.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was \u201cdeeply troubled by the drastic funding reduction.\"",
      "\u201cThe heads of our humanitarian agencies are being forced to take impossibly painful decisions as budget cuts have an immediate and often deadly impact on the world\u2019s most vulnerable,\u201d Dujarric said in a statement to The AP. \u201cWe understand the pressures on national budgets faced by governments, but these cuts come at a time when military spending again hits record levels.\"",
      "The WFP, the world\u2019s largest humanitarian organization, received 46% of its funding from the United States in 2024.",
      "Asked about the planned cuts, the organization said in a statement that \"in this challenging donor environment, WFP will prioritize its limited resources on vital programs that bring urgently needed food assistance to the 343 million people struggling with hunger and increasingly facing starvation.\u201d",
      "The internal memo said personnel cuts will \u201cimpact all geographies, divisions and levels\u201d in the agency. It suggested further downsizing may be needed and said the agency will review its \u201cportfolio of programs.\u201d",
      "The U.N.'s top refugee agency provides help to some 43.7 million refugees worldwide, along with others among the 122 million people driven from their homes by conflicts and natural disasters.",
      "It said a statement that the agency will \u201chave to significantly reduce our workforce,\u201d including downsizing the headquarters and regional offices. UNHCR said some country offices will be closed, but it did not give an immediate figure of how many staff will be cut.",
      "\u201cThe impact of this funding crunch on refugees\u2019 lives is already devastating and will get far worse,\u201d the agency said. Programs providing food, clean water, medicines, emergency shelter and other services \u201cwill reduce or stop.\u201d",
      "For example, it said, reduced funding will cut access to clean water for at least half a million displaced people in Sudan, increasing the risk of cholera and other disease outbreaks.",
      "It also will hurt efforts to house and provide schooling for refugees from Sudan in South Sudan, Chad and Uganda. It warned that the lack of facilities in host countries will push more refugees to attempt dangerous crossings to Europe.",
      "In the April 23 email to staff, the UNHCR chief said the headquarters and regional offices will be downsized to cut costs by 30%. It said senior-level positions will be capped to bring a 50% reduction.",

      "Canada\u2019s Liberals are celebrating election victory in a stunning turn of fortune",
      "TORONTO -- As Canada\u2019s Liberals celebrated election victory in a stunning turn of fortune, the country would not know until later Tuesday whether the party of Prime Minister Mark Carney would have an outright majority or need help in Parliament.",
      "Populist Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre \u2014 in the lead until U.S. President Donald Trump took aim at Canada with a trade war and annexation threats \u2014 was voted out of his Parliament seat in Monday's election.",
      "That capped a swift decline in fortunes for the firebrand Poilievre, who a few months ago appeared to be a shoo-in to become Canada\u2019s next prime minister and shepherd the Conservatives back into power for the first time in a decade.",
      "Poilievre, a career politician, campaigned with Trump-like bravado, taking a page from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president by adopting the slogan \u201cCanada First.\u201d But his similarities to Trump may have ultimately cost him and his party.",
      "The Liberals were projected to win more of Parliament\u2019s 343 seats than the Conservatives. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear if they would win an outright majority \u2014 at least 172 seats \u2014 or would need to rely on a smaller party to pass legislation.",
      "Elections Canada said it decided to pause counting of special ballots \u2014 cast by voters who are away from their districts during the election \u2014 until later Tuesday. The Liberals were leading or elected in 168 seats when counting was paused, four short of a majority. Elections Canada estimated that uncounted votes could affect the result in about a dozen districts.",
      "Canadians won\u2019t know until later in the day whether Carney\u2019s Liberals have won a minority or majority mandate.",
      "In a victory speech, Carney stressed unity in the face of Washington\u2019s threats. He said the mutually beneficial system Canada and the U.S. had shared since World War II had ended.",
      "\u201cWe are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,\u201d Carney added. \u201cThese are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never ... ever happen. But we also must recognize the reality that our world has fundamentally changed.\u201d",
      "Poilievre hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity declined toward the end of his decade in power as food and housing prices rose.",
      "But Trump attacked, Trudeau resigned and Carney, a two-time central banker, became the Liberal Party\u2019s leader and prime minister.",
      "In a concession speech before the race call on his own seat, Poilievre vowed to keep fighting for Canadians.",
      "\u201cWe are cognizant of the fact that we didn\u2019t get over the finish line yet,\u201d Poilievre said. \u201cWe know that change is needed, but change is hard to come by. It takes time. It takes work. And that\u2019s why we have to learn the lessons of tonight.\u201d",
      "McGill University political science professor Daniel B\u00e9land said nothing prevents Poilievre from remaining the Conservative leader without a seat but, if he decides to stay, he would need to run in another district \u2014 perhaps by asking a Conservative member of Parliament from a safe Conservative district to resign.",
      "\u201cStill, losing your seat when some people within your own party think you\u2019re the main reason why it failed to win is a clear issue for Poilievre,\u201d B\u00e9land said.",
      "\"Moreover, not having the leader of the official opposition in the House of Commons when Parliament sits again would obviously be a problem for the Conservatives, especially if we do end up with a minority Parliament.\u201d",
      "Even with Canadians grappling with deadly weekend attack at a Vancouver street festival, Trump was trolling them on election day, asserting he was on their ballot and erroneously claiming that the U.S. subsidizes Canada, writing, \u201cIt makes no sense unless Canada is a State!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s truculence has infuriated Canadians, leading many to cancel U.S. vacations, refuse to buy American goods and possibly even vote early. A record 7.3 million Canadians cast ballots before election day.",
      "Reid Warren, a Toronto resident, said he voted Liberal because Poilievre \u201csounds like mini-Trump to me.\u201d He said Trump\u2019s tariffs are a worry.",
      "\u201cCanadians coming together from, you know, all the shade being thrown from the States is great, but it\u2019s definitely created some turmoil, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said.",
      "Foreign policy hasn\u2019t dominated a Canadian election this much since 1988, when, ironically, free trade with the United States was the prevailing issue.",
      "Carney and the Liberals have daunting challenges ahead.",
      "If they don\u2019t win a majority in Parliament, the Liberals might need rely on a smaller party. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which looked set to finish third, is a separatist party from French-speaking Quebec that seeks independence. Trudeau\u2019s Liberals relied on the New Democrats to remain in power for four years, but the progressive party fared poorly on Monday and its leader, Jagmeet Singh, said he was stepping down after eight years in charge.",
      "\u201cIt appears the Liberals will not attain a majority, but the (New Democrats) will prop them up as before. I do not expect any formal deal between the parties,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.",
      "In addition to the trade war with the U.S. and frosty relationship with Trump, Canada is dealing with a cost-of-living crisis. And more than 75% of its exports go to the U.S., so Trump\u2019s tariffs threat and his desire to get North American automakers to move Canada\u2019s production south could severely damage the economy.",
      "Carney has vowed that every dollar the government collects from counter-tariffs on U.S. goods will go toward Canadian workers who are adversely affected. He also said he plans to offer a middle-class tax cut, return immigration to sustainable levels and increase funding to Canada\u2019s public broadcaster.",

While he initially became a close adviser to Pope Francis, Becciu\u2019s subsequent downfall at the hands of Francis might suggest he would vote for someone keen to undo some of Francis\u2019 reforms.",
      "At 76, Becciu is under the age limit of 80 and technically eligible to vote, but the Vatican\u2019s official statistics list him as a \u201cnon-elector.\u201d",
      "The Vatican document regulating a conclave, known by its Latin name Universi Dominici Gregis, lays out the criteria for electors, making clear that 80 cardinals under 80 have the right to elect the pope, except those who have been \u201ccanonically deposed or who with the consent of the Roman Pontiff have renounced the cardinalate.\u201d It adds that after a pope has died, \u201cthe College of Cardinals cannot readmit or rehabilitate them.\u201d",
      "There has never been any clarity on what exactly Becciu renounced or how: The one-line statement issued by the Vatican press office on Sept. 24, 2020, said merely that Francis had accepted Becciu\u2019s resignation as prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints \u201cand his rights connected to the cardinalate.\u201d There is no indication he has been sanctioned canonically.",
      "After he forced Becciu\u2019s resignation, Francis visited Becciu on occasions and allowed him to participate in the life of the Vatican. But Francis also changed Vatican law to allow the city state\u2019s criminal tribunal to prosecute him.",
      "Italian daily Domani reported last week that during the initial pre-conclave discussions, Becciu was presented with two letters signed by Francis before he died indicating he should not participate in the conclave. Becciu's reference of Francis' will in his statement Tuesday suggests that the letters were the tipping point that convinced him to withdraw from the vote.",
      "Questions, meanwhile, have continued to swirl about the integrity of the trial that convicted Becciu and eight others. During the proceedings, the court heard that Francis intervened on several occasions on behalf of the prosecutors and that the prosecution\u2019s prime witness against Becciu was coached and manipulated by outsiders.",
      "The appeal is scheduled to begin in September.",

      "Cardinals have decided the conclave to elect a successor to Pope Francis will begin May 7",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 A conclave is the centuries-old election of a pope that derives its name from the Italian \u201ccon clave\u201d (with a key) to underscore that cardinals are sequestered until they find a winner.",
      "Cardinals have no contact with the outside world after the master of liturgical ceremonies utters the words \u201cExtra Omnes\u201d the Latin phrase for \u201call out,\u201d to ask all those present except the cardinal electors to leave the Sistine Chapel to begin the voting process.",
      "In between votes, the cardinals will be staying at the Domus Santa Marta hotel in Vatican City and possibly another nearby Vatican residence, since there are more cardinal electors than Santa Marta hotel rooms.",
      "The conclave begins May 7, in the afternoon.",
      "The day begins with Mass celebrated in the morning by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.",
      "In the afternoon, the cardinals process into the Sistine Chapel and take their seats. A priest delivers a meditation and the cardinals take an oath. After the \u201cExtra Omnes,\u201d the conclave begins.",
      "Unless there are any outstanding questions or problems, cardinals take a single vote the afternoon of May 7, seeking a two-thirds majority. If they don't find a winner on the first ballot, they retire for the evening and return to the Sistine Chapel the following morning.",
      "They can take up to two votes each morning, and two each afternoon until they have a winner.",
      "Only cardinals under age 80 are eligible to vote. Current regulations notionally limit the number of electors to 120, but popes often exceeded that ceiling and today there are 135 who are eligible.",
      "Those cardinals who are over 80 can\u2019t vote but can participate in pre-conclave meetings, known as general congregations, in which church problems are discussed. It was in these meetings in 2013 that then-Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio spoke about the need for the church to go to the \u201cexistential peripheries\u201d to find those who suffer \u2014 an off-the-cuff speech that helped his election.",
      "St. John Paul II rewrote the regulations on papal elections in a 1996 document that remains largely in force today, though Pope Benedict XVI amended it twice before he resigned.",
      "Francis didn't introduce any changes into the conclave itself, though his influence will surely be felt given he named 108 of the 135 cardinal-electors who are eligible to vote.",
      "Benedict's most notable change to the original 1996 document was to exclude the possibility that a pope could be elected by a simple majority if voting was stalemated. Benedict decreed that a two-thirds majority is always needed, no matter how long it takes. He did so to prevent cardinals from holding out for the 12 days foreseen by John Paul and then pushing through a candidate with a slim majority.",
      "If the conclave lasts that long, the top two vote-getters go to a runoff, with a two-thirds majority required to win. Neither of the top two candidates casts a ballot in the runoff.",
      "Any baptized Catholic male is eligible to be pope, but since 1378, only cardinals have been selected. Cardinals over age 80 can be elected pope, even if they can't be in the room to cast a ballot.",
      "Francis and popes before him have upheld the ban on ordaining women as priests, which precludes them from being pope. Under Catholic doctrine, the priesthood is reserved for men because Christ chose only men as his 12 apostles. The teaching is considered divinely inspired and infallible.",
      "Benedict tightened the oath of secrecy in the conclave, making clear that anyone who reveals what went on inside faces automatic excommunication.",
      "In John Paul\u2019s rules, excommunication was always a possibility, but Benedict revised the oath that liturgical assistants and secretaries take to make it explicit, saying they must observe \u201cabsolute and perpetual secrecy\u201d and explicitly refrain from using any audio or video recording devices.",
      "They now declare: \u201cI take this oath fully aware that an infraction thereof will incur the penalty of automatic excommunication reserved to the Apostolic See. So help me God and these Holy Gospels, which I touch with my hand.\u201d",
      "After the ballots are pierced, they are burned in a cylindrical stove at the end of the voting session. Black smoke from the Sistine Chapel chimney means no decision; white smoke signals the cardinals have chosen a pope and that he has accepted.",
      "Chemical cartridges are added to ensure there is no confusion over the color. To produce black smoke, a cartridge containing potassium perchlorate, anthracene \u2014 the component of coal tar \u2014 and sulfur is burned with the ballots. For white smoke, a cartridge of potassium chlorate, lactose and chloroform resin is burned with the ballots.",
      "Bells also are rung to signal the election of a pope, for further clarity.",
      "The new pope is introduced from the loggia overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square with the words, \u201cHabemus Papam!\u201d (\u201cWe have a pope!\u201d) and his chosen papal name. The new pope then emerges and gives his first blessing.",

      "LONDON -- President Donald Trump is pushing Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the war, threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult \u2014 and causing alarm bells in Europe about how to fill the gap.",
      "Ukraine's European allies view the war as fundamental to the continent's security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily \u2014 regardless of whether Trump pulls out.",
      "Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of prolonging the \u201ckilling field\u201d by pushing back on his demand that Ukraine hand over occupied Crimea to Moscow.",
      "Trump\u2019s land-for-peace plan would mark a significant shift in the post-World War II order, ripping up conventions that have long held that borders should not be redrawn by force.",
      "\u201cIt took a World War to roll back de jure annexations and 60 million people died,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, referring to the pre-war annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany.",
      "\u201cEuropeans will not accept it\" and Ukraine will not either, he said.",
      "Diplomats and experts described various scenarios if the U.S. decides to walk. They range from the U.S. ceasing direct aid to Ukraine \u2014 but allowing European nations to pass on critical American intelligence and weapons to Kyiv \u2014 to Trump banning transfers of any American technology, including components or software in European weapons.",
      "Any withdrawal of U.S. military aid to Ukraine could create serious difficulties for Europe, analysts and diplomats told The Associated Press. Kyiv's ability to keep fighting would depend on European political will to muster money and weapons \u2014 and how quickly the gaps left by Washington can be filled.",
      "If it were easy, Europe would \u201calready be doing things without America,\u201d said a European diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.",
      "No new U.S. aid package for Ukraine has been approved since Trump came into office, even as European nations have collectively provided Ukraine with more aid than Washington, according to the Keil Institute.",
      "Europe has contributed around $157 billion, some $26 billion more than the U.S., although Washington slightly outpaces Europe when it comes to military aid, the Germany-based institute said.",
      "It will be hard, but there are ways Europe can find cash to fund Ukraine \u2014 including seizing frozen Russian assets \u2014 but \u201cmoney isn't what you shoot bullets with,\u201d Heisbourg said.",
      "Europe\u2019s \"big mistake\" was undertaking major military downsizing following the Cold War and thinking \u201cthis war started in February 2022 and not in February 2014,\u201d when Moscow invaded and then annexed Crimea, said Thomas Gomart, director of IFRI, a French international affairs think tank.",
      "Europeans are scrambling to acquire weapons for themselves and for Ukraine, while confronting constraints on production capacity, a fragmented defense industry and a decades-long reliance on the U.S.",
      "Some extra production capacity could come from Ukraine, which has ramped up manufacturing of ammunition and drones since Russia's invasion. Much harder to replace, experts said, are advanced American weapons, including air defenses.",
      "Russia has attacked Ukraine almost nightly since Putin\u2019s forces invaded in February 2022, flooding the skies with missiles and drones, including dummy attack drones to exhaust Ukraine's limited air defenses. In April, at least 57 people were killed in multiple strikes.",
      "The death toll from the Russian attacks would \u201cinevitably\u201d be higher without the American Patriot air-defense missile systems protecting Ukraine's skies, said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "The Patriots can track and intercept Russian missiles, including the hypersonic Kinzhal, which Putin has boasted was unstoppable. Kyiv uses them to protect critical infrastructure, including the country's energy grid.",
      "Earlier this month, Zelenskyy asked to buy 10 Patriots, a request Trump dismissed. \u201cYou don\u2019t start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" he said, a day after a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy killed 35 people.",
      "France and Italy have given Ukraine their Aster SAMP/T air-defense system but the issue is not \u201cquality, it\u2019s quantity,\u201d Barrie said, pointing to the larger U.S. defense industrial base and greater U.S. stockpiles.",
      "Although Trump criticized Putin over the weekend for his missile strikes and suggested imposing more sanctions on Russia, for Europe it remains a wait-and-see game.",
      "The whiplash of Trump's aggressive foreign policy means nothing is off the cards, experts said.",
      "A worst-case scenario could see a ban on American weapons exports and transfers to Ukraine, which would bar European nations from buying U.S. weapons to give to Kyiv or transferring weapons with American components or software, Barrie said.",
      "That could mean countries, including Germany, that have already given American Patriots to Ukraine would be prohibited from doing so. Such a move would seriously hamper Europe's ability to support Kyiv and mark a fundamental shift in America's relationship with its allies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the U.S. to cease to be an ally, it is another for the U.S. to be an enemy,\u201d Heisbourg said, noting that such a step could also damage the U.S. defense sector if weapons purchases were perceived to be unusable on Trump\u2019s political order.",
      "In March, the Trump administration suspended intelligence sharing with Ukraine in a bid to force Zelenskyy to accept a truce with Russia. The about weeklong suspension impacted Ukraine's ability to track and target Russian troops, tanks and ships.",
      "There are certain capabilities, including \u201chigher-end\u201d surveillance and reconnaissance using satellites that \u201conly the United States can provide,\u201d said Matthew Kroenig, vice president of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security in Washington.",
      "While the extent of intelligence sharing between the U.S. and Ukraine is not known, experts said it likely shows Kyiv near real-time buildup of Russian troop deployments and helps target long-range strikes.",
      "Ukraine's allies do not have as much satellite capability as the U.S. but could launch more, or Ukraine could use commercial systems if Trump cuts off intelligence again, experts said. The latter would likely have to come from a European provider \u2014 in March, the American satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies confirmed it temporarily suspended access to unclassified satellite images following the administration's decision to pull intelligence sharing.",
      "Ukraine also needs an alternative to Elon Musk's satellite network Starlink, which is critical for Ukrainian defensive and civilian communications. European defense companies are discussing creating a satellite alliance but don't currently have an alternative on the same scale.",
      "If Trump walks away, or if Kyiv rejects a deal and keeps fighting with European support, it won\u2019t necessarily mean \"the collapse of Ukraine\" although more people will almost certainly die if the U.S. pulls its air defenses and intelligence-sharing capabilities, Heisbourg said.",
      "Trump has jolted European leaders into awareness that they need to take responsibility for their own defense, regardless of who occupies the White House, experts said.",
      "That means European nations need to invest more in defense, work together to scale up military production and build trust to share intelligence.",
      "\u201cThis issue is not a question about the next two months or the next two years. This issue is about the next two decades,\u201d Gomart said.",

      "Four former Hong Kong lawmakers have been released after spending more than four years in prison for their conviction under a Beijing-imposed law that crushed a once-thriving pro-democracy movement",
      "HONG KONG -- Four former Hong Kong lawmakers were freed from prison on Tuesday, having served more than four years for their conviction under a Beijing-imposed law that crushed a once-thriving pro-democracy movement.",
      "Claudia Mo, Jeremy Tam, Kwok Ka-ki and Gary Fan were among 47 activists arrested in 2021 for their roles in an unofficial primary election. They were the first of the convicted activists to reunite with their families and friends following years of separation.",
      "Only vehicles involved in the release operation were seen leaving the three prisons in the remote areas of the Asian financial hub under tight security. The curtains of the vehicles were down. Reporters who waited for hours outside the prisons where they were held were unable to see them in person around the facilities.",
      "An Associated Press reporter saw Mo's husband, Philip Bowring, waiting for the activist to return home at their residence before being escorted by police out of the area where they live.",
      "In a video posted by local online media HK01, Fan, when asked by a reporter about his feelings, thanked Hong Kongers and the media for their concern. He added he was going to reunite with his family.",
      "The 2020 unofficial primary drew 610,000 voters, and its winners had been expected to advance to the official legislative election. Authorities postponed that, however, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "During the trial, prosecutors said the activists aimed to paralyze Hong Kong\u2019s government and force the city\u2019s leader to resign by aiming to win a legislative majority and using it to block government budgets indiscriminately. The judges said in their verdict last year that the activists\u2019 plans to effect change through the unofficial primary would have undermined the government\u2019s authority and created a constitutional crisis.",
      "Only two of the 47 original defendants were acquitted. The remaining activists received prison terms ranging from four years and two months to 10 years on a charge of conspiracy to commit subversion. Mo, Tam, Kwok and Fan, who got the shortest terms, had their sentences reduced after pleading guilty.",
      "Regardless of their term length, years of separation have pained the activists and their families. The case involved democracy advocates across the spectrum. They include legal scholar Benny Tai, who got a 10-year prison term, and former student leader Joshua Wong, who has to serve four years and eight months.",
      "Fourteen of the convicted activists would appeal their cases. The government lawyers would also appeal the acquittal of one activist.",
      "Critics said their convictions illustrated how authorities crushed dissent following massive anti-government protests in 2019, alongside media crackdowns and reduced public choice in elections. The drastic political changes reflect that the Western-style civil liberties Beijing promised to retain in the former British colony for 50 years when it returned to China in 1997 were shrinking, they said.",
      "Beijing and Hong Kong governments insisted the national security law was necessary for the city\u2019s stability. China defended the judicial decisions, despite criticism from foreign governments.",

      "The climber was identified only as a 27-year-old Chinese student living in Japan. He made an emergency call on April 22 and was airlifted after developing symptoms of altitude sickness, police said, adding that his climbing irons also were damaged.",
      "On Saturday, he returned to the mountain's Fujinomiya trail about 3,000 meters (nearly 10,000 feet) above sea level to look for his cell phone and other belongings left behind, Shizuoka prefectural police said.

      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- China struck a defiant stance on Tuesday in response to American concerns about Beijing's efforts to expand its influence in the resource-rich South American nation of Chile, escalating tensions over a Chinese astronomical venture in Chile\u2019s arid north.",
      "At a press conference Tuesday in Chile's capital of Santiago, China's ambassador to Chile, Niu Qingbao, lambasted the United States for \u201cinterfering in Chile\u2019s sovereign right to independently choose its partners\u201d and spreading \"disinformation about the project.\u201d",
      "The astronomy project stems from a 2023 agreement between China's state-run National Astronomical Observatory and Chile's Catholic University of the North to work on a powerful space observatory in the country's vast northern Atacama Desert. The proposed high-resolution telescope would be able to observe near-Earth objects, which are classified as asteroids or comets.",
      "But the project quickly became entangled in China's spiraling rivalry with the Trump administration.",
      "Worries in Washington have mounted over China's clout on America's doorstep, as Beijing builds infrastructure, boosts investment in agriculture, energy, mining and other sectors across Latin America and displaces the U.S. as the region's biggest trading partner.",
      "During his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this month, Brandon Judd, Trump\u2019s nominee for U.S. ambassador to Chile, raised alarm about China's growing footprint in one of Latin America\u2019s most prosperous and stable countries. As ambassador, he said he would seek to persuade Chile that \u201cwe are the better trade partner.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are the better partner in everything, whether it\u2019s Antarctica, fisheries, marine conservation \u2014 in all of the areas that are very important to Chile,\u201d Judd told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \"We will continue to strengthen our ties to Chile and limit China\u2019s access to all of the resources that Chile might have available.\u201d",
      "In grilling Judd, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire described China's planned telescope in Chile \u2014 as well as its space mission control station already operating in neighboring Argentina \u2014 as markers for Beijing\u2019s global power ambitions.",
      "\u201cChina is increasing its influence throughout Latin America, throughout Africa, throughout the world, at a time when the United States is pulling back,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cThat is not in our security interest.\u201d",
      "As U.S. concern grew, the Chilean government announced it was suspending the project for review. \u201cIts scope remains to be clarified,\u201d the Chilean Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Although China denies that the project has any military purpose, American officials have raised fears about the potential of such space observatories to increase China\u2019s intelligence-gathering capabilities.",
      "Ambassador Niu dismissed those fears on Tuesday, saying, \u201cChina has no interest in geopolitics.\" He accused the U.S. of provoking tensions by \u201cdefaming Chinese projects by invoking geopolitical arguments.\u201d",
      "He claimed the proposed observatory was \u201cof the same nature\u201d as the many other telescopes in northern Chile, including an American-funded telescope known as the Rubin Observatory coming into operation later this year.",
      "\u201cWe are closely monitoring the developments of the incident and hope that the Chilean side can eliminate U.S. interference and approve the implementation of the project as soon as possible,\u201d Niu said.",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ambassador's remarks.",
      "Chile's government spokesperson, Ais\u00e9n Etcheverry, said authorities were talking with both the private Catholic university in the country's north and the Chinese National Astronomical Observatory \u201cto understand whether this astronomical project falls within Chile\u2019s institutional framework.\u201d",
      "The U.S., the European Union, Australia and a range of other countries operate observatories in Chile\u2019s Atacama Desert. The region's geography \u2014 bone-dry and high-altitude, with steady air and the cloud-blocking Andes Mountains to the east \u2014 produces exceptionally clear conditions that have made it a major hub for global astronomy.",

      "\u201cNational reconciliation does not mean forgetting the history or erasing differences, but accepting different perspectives in tolerance and respect, to work towards a greater goal: building a peaceful, unified, powerful, civilized and prosperous Vietnam,\u201d Communist Party general secretary To Lam said in an article published on a government website.",
      "He said that the war had historical roots and had resulted in divisions in the country, but now Vietnam was armed with \u201clessons of its past.\u201d",
      "The emphasis on reconciliation and not, like previous years, on military victory reflected how Vietnam was approaching the changing tides of the global economy and geopolitics today, said Nguyen Khac Giang, an analyst at Singapore\u2019s ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute. He added that the Vietnam War remains central to how the Communist Party framed its legitimacy, not just as a military triumph but also as a symbol of national unity. But To Lam\u2019s comments underlined that the reconciliation remains unfinished.",
      "\u201cThe war still defines Vietnam\u2019s unity, and its unresolved divides,\u201d Giang said.",
      "Pham Ngoc Son is a 69-year-old veteran who was an army truck driver bringing troops and supplies from the north to the south through the Ho Chi Minh trail \u2014 the secret route used by North Vietnam. He's on a weeklong tour of the city, which he remembers entering as a part of the northern troops that took over.",
      "He said he cherished those memories and couldn't describe the joy he felt at that moment. But now there was \u201donly space for peace and friendship\" between the U.S. and Vietnam.",
      "\u201cThe war is over a long time ago,\" he said.",
      "Nguyen Thi Hue, a resident of Ho Chi Minh city, agreed.",
      "\u201cThe war has ended and we shake hands (with the former enemy) for development. Now it\u2019s time for peace. Peace is the dream that everyone in the world wants,\u201d Hue said.",
      "This year also marks the 30-year anniversary of diplomatic ties between Vietnam and the United States. In 2023, Vietnam upgraded its relations with the U.S. to that of a comprehensive strategic partner, the highest diplomatic status it gives to any country and the same level of relations as China and Russia.",
      "Vietnamese officials insist that this relationship has been built on a bedrock of trust intrinsically linked to U.S. efforts to address war legacies such as Agent Orange and unexploded bombs in the countryside that still threaten lives. The future of those projects is now at risk because of the Trump administration\u2019s broad cuts to USAID. Moreover, the export-dependent country is vulnerable in a global economy made fragile by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans.",
      "About 13,000 people, including troops, militias, veterans and local citizens, were expected to take part in the parade. And, apart from China, troops from Laos and Cambodia also were due to attend the parade, which will march on the main boulevard leading to the Independence Palace before branching out through the streets in the city. The route will also pass the U.S. Consulate in the city.",
      "Meanwhile, a video of Chinese troops singing the iconic \u201cAs If Uncle Ho Were With Us on Victory Day\u201d during an earlier rehearsal was shared widely on social media. Chinese leader Xi Jinping had visited Vietnam earlier in the month in a bid to present the country as a force for stability in contrast with Trump.",
      "Close ties with Washington helped Vietnam balance its relations with its much larger and more powerful neighbor China, said Huong Le-Thu of the International Crisis Group think tank. Vietnam is among the countries involved in maritime disputes related to the South China Sea.",
      "But the Trump administration\u2019s focus on tariffs \u2014 Vietnam was slammed with reciprocal tariffs of 46%, one of the highest \u2014 puts a \u201cbig question mark\u201d on what the U.S. wants to achieve in Asia, she said. Focus on economic and not strategic competition may mean that Vietnam and other countries in Southeast Asia become less important for the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt really will be shaping up (on) how the new administration sees the strategic picture in the Indo-Pacific and where countries like Vietnam would fit in,\u201d she said.",

      "Prosecutors say the founder and former CEO of the failed cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network should face 20 years behind bars for telling lies and engaging in self-dealing that cost customers billions of dollars in losses",
      "NEW YORK -- The founder and former CEO of the failed cryptocurrency lending platform Celsius Network should face 20 years behind bars for lying and self-dealing that cost customers billions of dollars in losses, prosecutors told a judge Tuesday.",
      "Alexander Mashinsky, 59, told thousands of customers that their money was safe and secure, leading to investors pouring over $20 billion into Celsius by 2021, they wrote in a submission ahead of a scheduled May 8 sentencing in Manhattan federal court.",
      "\u201cThey were not,\u201d prosecutors said, noting that Celsius declared bankruptcy in 2022 and acknowledged that it could not return to customers what they had invested.",
      "Prosecutors said Mashinsky fabricated Celsius' profitability and put customers' funds at the mercy of uncollateralized loans and undisclosed market bets. Meanwhile the company advertised itself as a modern-day bank where people could deposit crypto assets safely and earn interest.",
      "\u201cMashinsky\u2019s conduct made him rich,\u201d they wrote.",
      "In their own submission to the judge, defense lawyers said their client should face no more than a year and a day in prison after pleading guilty in December to federal fraud charges. In doing so he admitted to misleading customers between 2018 and 2022.",
      "The defense blamed the collapse of Celsius on a \u201ccataclysmic downturn\u201d of cryptocurrency markets in May and June of 2022.",
      "\u201cHis actions were never predatory, exploitative or venal. He never acted with the intent to hurt anyone. He never stole money or scurried away with anyone\u2019s assets. And he has never been driven by greed, cruelty, or avarice,\u201d the lawyers said.",
      "They also noted that Mashinsky had a difficult early life in a small Ukrainian town in the former Soviet Union, which his family fled when he was 7. They moved to Israel, where Mashinsky served for three years in the Israeli Defense Forces as a fighter pilot.",
      "\u201cThis case is not about an arrogant, greedy swindler who thought he could get away with stealing people\u2019s hard-earned money to satisfy his own hedonistic pleasures. Nor is it about a sham company that was exposed as a house of cards when it went bankrupt. Those are posthoc, shallow and dehumanizing tropes that do not apply here,\u201d the defense said.",
      "The lawyers described Mashinsky as a devoted father to six children who deserves leniency in part because his crimes arose from \u201cotherwise legitimate efforts that have crossed over into criminality as a result of unexpected difficulties.\u201d",
      "At his plea, Mashinsky admitted illegally manipulating the price of Celsius\u2019 proprietary crypto token while secretly selling his own tokens at inflated prices to pocket about $48 million.",
      "In court, he admitted that in 2021 he publicly suggested there was regulatory consent for the company\u2019s moves because he knew that customers \u201cwould find false comfort\u201d with that.",
      "He said that in 2019, he was selling crypto tokens even though he told the public that he was not, knowing customers also would draw false comfort from that.",
      "An indictment alleged that Mashinsky promoted Celsius through media interviews, his social media accounts and Celsius\u2019 website, along with a weekly \u201cAsk Mashinsky Anything\u201d session broadcast that was posted to Celsius\u2019 website and a YouTube channel.",

      "The recall covers certain Cadillac Escalades and Escalade ESVs; Chevrolet Silverado 1500s, Suburbans and Tahoes; as well as GMC Sierra 1500s, Yukons and Yukon XLs between model years 2021 and 2024.",
      "According to recall documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, these vehicles share a gas engine that may have connecting rod or crankshaft component problems, due to supplier manufacturing or quality issues. This can lead to engine damage, and potentially failure, while driving \u2014 increasing crash risks.",
      "Prior to failure, NHSTA documents warn, impacted drivers may be alerted of these issues through loud knocking or banging noises, the check engine light turning on and/or other driving performance issues, such as reduced propulsion.",

      "In all, about 597,630 vehicles are covered by the recall, per a notice dated April 24. But the company estimates that just 3% have the defect.",
      "When asked why owner notification wouldn't start until June 9, GM maintained that it was \u201ccommon to require time\u201d to both confirm mailing lists for registered owners and ensure that dealers are prepared. The Detroit-based auto company added that it was continuing to increase engine production, but felt confident about having \u201csufficient supply to service this recall campaign\" \u2014 noting that it only expects a small percentage to need replacements.",

      "WASHINGTON -- As part of their big tax bill, Republicans in Congress are pumping billions of dollars into President Donald Trump's mass deportation and border security plan with nearly 20,000 new officers, stark new $1,000 in fees on migrants seeking asylum and $46.5 billion for a long-sought border wall.",
      "Tuesday launched the first of back-to-back public hearings as House Republicans roll out the fine print of what Trump calls his \u201c big, beautiful bill \u201d \u2014 which is focused on $5 trillion in tax breaks and up to $2 trillion in slashed domestic spending. But it also pours some $300 billion to beef up the Pentagon and border security as the Trump administration says it's running out of money for deportations.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson is pushing to have the bill wrapped up by Memorial Day and then send it to the Senate, which is drafting its own version.",

      "As Trump rounds his 100th day in office, the GOP's stiff immigration provisions come as Americans are showing unease with the president's approach, with just half saying he's focused on the right priorities. The White House is battling high-profile court cases after it mistakenly deported a Maryland man to El Salvador and, over the weekend, Trump's team rounded up countless immigrants, including foreign-born parents who were deported with their American-born toddlers and small children in tow.",
      "Democrats are fighting back in the House and Senate, and the halls of public opinion, but as the minority party in Congress, they have little ability to stop the forward march of the package.",
      "Instead, they used Tuesday's hearings to try to shame Republicans into rethinking their approach.",

      "There's also $4 billion to hire an additional 3,000 new Border Patrol agents as well as 5,000 new customs officers, and $2.1 billion for signing and retention bonuses.",
      "Democrats kept the committee in session for hours, submitting some three dozen amendments to change the package. They all failed.",
      "Among the first Democratic amendments offered was from Rep. Troy Carter of Louisiana to prohibit the use of funding to deport American children. Another from Rep. Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island would stop the money from being used to send Americans to foreign prisons.",

      "For the first time, the U.S. under the legislation would impose a $1,000 fee on migrants seeking asylum \u2014 something the nation has never done.",
      "Experts said the new fee on asylum seekers would put the U.S. on par with a few others, including Australia and Iran.",
      "And that's not all. The Judiciary Committee is expected to meet Wednesday on its $110 billion section of the package.",
      "There would be new fees on various other legal paths to entry, including a $3,500 fee for those sponsoring unaccompanied children to enter the U.S., a $2,500 penalty if sponsors of unaccompanied children skip court appearances and a $1,000 fee for individuals paroled into the U.S.",
      "Overall, the plan is to remove 1 million immigrants annually and house 100,000 people in detention centers. It calls for 10,000 more Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and investigators.",
      "Meanwhile, the House Armed Services Committee started drilling down Tuesday into its section of the package, with some $100 billion in new spending, including some $5 billion for border security.",
      "But the hearing became tangled by questions from Democrats over funding for Ukraine, Trump's plan for a big military parade and calls for Hegseth to be fired or resign.",
      "Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., a veteran herself, offered an amendment that would prohibit the provisions from going into effect until Hegseth \"is no longer Secretary of Defense.\"",

Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a combat veteran, had an amendment to prevent money on Trump's parade, which is planned for June in Washington, saying there shouldn't be a military parade for a \u201cdraft dodger,\u201d a reference to Trump's medical deferral from Vietnam War-era service.",

And some elements of our plan will move faster than others,\u201d Starbucks Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol said in a video message to employees. \u201cWe have a lot of work ahead, but we are on the right track and moving quickly.\u201d",
      "The Seattle coffee giant said Tuesday that its quarterly revenue rose 2% to $8.76 billion in the January-March period. That was short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations of $8.83 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",

A four-minute service time was one of the first goals Niccol set when he joined Starbucks. Niccol said the program will be rolled out to 3,000 stores by the end of this fiscal year.",
      "Niccol said Starbucks is also boosting staffing and allowing employees to pick up extra shifts at nearby stores. He said in recent years, Starbucks had cut staffing and hoped that automated systems would pick up the slack. But it led to long wait times and employee burnout.",
      "\u201cWhat we're discovering is the equipment doesn\u2019t solve the customer experience that we need to provide, but rather staffing the stores and deploying with this technology behind it does,\u201d Niccol said Tuesday during a conference call with investors.",
      "But those efforts have been costly. Starbucks said its net income dropped 50% to $384 million in its fiscal second quarter. Adjusted earnings fell nearly 40% to 41 cents per share. That was lower than the 49-cent per share profit Wall Street forecast.",
      "Niccol said Starbucks plans to stick with its promise not to raise prices this fiscal year, despite increased costs from tariffs.",
      "Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said the company sources coffee from 28 different countries, mostly in Latin America. Starbucks' biggest exposure to tariffs, however, is with merchandise and beverage ingredients sourced from China. Smith said Starbucks is now shifting that production to local suppliers.",
      "Starbucks said its same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 1% globally. That was slightly worse than the 0.8% drop analysts forecast.",
      "While international same-store sales increased 2% \u2014 and store traffic improved in China \u2014 U.S. same-store sales fell 2%.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Tuesday confirmed former Sen. David Perdue as ambassador to China, just as the U.S. and China are locked in a tariff showdown that threatens to redefine diplomatic relations between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "Perdue, a Republican who served one term as a U.S. senator from Georgia, was confirmed 67-29 with some Democratic support. At his confirmation hearing this month, the former business executive called the U.S. relationship with China the \u201cmost consequential diplomatic challenge of the 21st century.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur approach to China should be nuanced, nonpartisan and strategic,\u201d Perdue said.",
      "President Donald Trump, who selected Perdue in December, slapped 145% tariffs on Chinese goods this month, and Beijing retaliated by charging 125% tariffs on U.S. products, with no sign for any immediate climbdown.",
      "While the Trump administration appears to be betting that the high tariffs will not be sustainable for the Chinese economy and will bring Beijing to the negotiating table, the Chinese leadership has vowed to \u201cfight to the end.\u201d China is readjusting domestic policies to expand the domestic market and reduce reliance on the U.S.",
      "\u201cNo matter how the global situation changes, we will anchor our development goals, maintain our strategic focus and concentrate efforts on doing our own work,\u201d said Zhao Chenxin, vice chairman of China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission.",
      "Perdue will arrive in a China that is increasingly challenging U.S. global dominance. Chinese forces are more assertive in the Taiwan Strait as well as in the South China Sea, and the country has risen to be a near-peer competitor in areas such as artificial intelligence and humanoid robots.",
      "The Trump administration is set to get tougher on tech competition, while seeking ways to prevent any military confrontation with Beijing, though there has been a mutual distrust, especially over flashpoints such as the future of the self-governed island of Taiwan.",
      "Yun Sun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center, said Perdue\u2019s confirmation is timely because \u201ccredible points of contact\u201d are essential to stabilizing the two countries\u2019 relationship amid the tariff war.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Perdue's confirmation.",
      "Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, said ahead of the vote that Perdue\u2019s nomination was \u201ccertainly one of the most important appointments that will come across this floor.\u201d",
      "Perdue lost his Senate seat to Democrat Jon Ossoff four years ago and ran unsuccessfully in a 2022 primary against Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. Perdue pushed Trump\u2019s false claims of electoral fraud in the 2020 election during his failed bid for governor.",
      "Before launching his political career, Perdue held a string of top executive positions, including at Sara Lee, Reebok and Dollar General.",
      "As a business executive, Perdue has lived in Hong Kong and touted his global perspective. He\u2019s been criticized for having outsourced jobs to China but embraced Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d strategy during his confirmation hearing, vowing to help \u201censure our own national and economic security remains uncompromised.\u201d",
      "At the hearing, Perdue also said Washington and Beijing should \u201cseek areas where our interests align to develop a better and safer working relationship.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s new uncertainty about updated COVID-19 shots this fall after the Trump administration\u2019s handling of a shot from Novavax",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration's effort to impose new requirements on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine \u2014 the nation's only traditional protein-based option for the coronavirus \u2014 is sowing uncertainty about updates to other vaccines, too.",
      "Novavax said Monday that the Food and Drug Administration was asking the company to run a new clinical trial of its vaccine after the agency grants full approval. The company said it had responded and that it believed its shot remains \u201capprovable.\u201d",
      "But a weekend post on social media by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary suggested the prospect of needing a new trial before the shots' yearly strain update \u2014 something unlikely to be possible before fall. That's raised questions about whether other vaccines will be caught in the turmoil.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think because there\u2019s a strain change that this is a new product,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief. If that\u2019s the new policy, \u201cyou\u2019d always be doing clinical trials and you\u2019d never have a vaccine that was up to date.\u201d",
      "The unusual move at FDA come shortly after the agency's longtime vaccine chief was forced out over disagreements with Makary's boss, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Kennedy won Senate confirmation to his job, in part, by promising not to change the nation\u2019s vaccine schedule. Since taking office, he\u2019s promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d children\u2019s shots, canceled meetings of expert vaccine advisers and directed officials to look again for connections between vaccines and autism, a link long-ago debunked.",
      "The Novavax vaccine, which originally showed effectiveness in a nearly 30,000-person clinical trial, is still being sold under emergency use authorization in the U.S. The nation's other two options, mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna, have earned full FDA approval for certain age groups.",
      "Because the coronavirus continually mutates, manufacturers follow instructions from FDA to make one change each year to their recipe \u2014 which strain to target \u2014 just like flu vaccines.",
      "The FDA was on track to grant Novavax full approval by its April 1 target date, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential agency matters. But Trump appointees directed FDA scientists to pause their decision, according to one of the people. Since that highly unusual move, Novavax and the agency have been discussing additional requirements for approval.",
      "In his weekend tweet, FDA's Makary referred to the Novavax vaccine as \u201ca new product,\u201d presumably because it had been updated to match last year's common coronavirus strain.",
      "\u201cNew products require new clinical studies,\u201d Makary added.",
      "An administration spokesman didn't respond to specific questions about Pfizer and Moderna but suggested all COVID-19 vaccines could face stricter requirements.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now been years since COVID has presented the threat it once did, and the urgency to rush approval of boosters without normal oversight no longer exists,\u201d said Andrew Nixon, a Health and Human Services spokesman, in a statement.",
      "The FDA had been treating the annual COVID-19 strain updates exactly as it's done for decades with flu vaccines \u2014 not as new products, but existing ones that are merely adjusted to protect against the latest strains, said Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Offit said the companies still must perform tests in small numbers of people that show these updated vaccines produce levels of virus-fighting antibodies known to be protective, and they're closely monitored for safety.",
      "Nixon, the HHS spokesman, suggested the policy might not apply to the flu shot, \u201cwhich has been tried and tested for more than 80 years.\u201d",
      "Under federal law, the FDA is required to follow established procedures when issuing requirements to drugmakers for approval. If the agency skips certain steps or imposes additional requirements for political reasons, experts say, it could be sued by drugmakers \u2014 or even patients, such as those who prefer the Novavax vaccine over its competitors because of an allergy or some other reason.",
      "In addition to large clinical trials conducted before all three COVID-19 vaccines were cleared for use, there's data on real-world use, said former Health Secretary Xavier Becerra, who oversaw COVID-19 vaccine policy during the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cAt the point where I had left, we had put some 700 million COVID vaccines into the arms of Americans,\u201d he said. \"That\u2019s a pretty good size clinical trial.\"",

      "The Trump administration raised tariffs on goods from China to 145% in early April",
      "NEW YORK -- Major orders canceled. Containers of products left stranded overseas. No roadmap for what comes next.",
      "The Trump administration raised tariffs on goods from China to 145% in early April. Since then, small business owners who depend on imports from China to survive have become increasingly desperate as they eye dwindling inventory and skyrocketing invoices.",
      "President Donald Trump seemed to back down somewhat last week when he said he expected the tariffs to come down \u201csubstantially.\u201d That helped set off a rally in the stock market. But for small businesses that operate on razor-thin margins, the back and forth is causing massive upheaval. Some say they could be just months from going out of business altogether.",
      "Game makers are particularly susceptible to the tariffs since the majority of games and toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, according to The Toy Association.",
      "WS Game Co., based in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, is a family-owned business that licenses Hasbro board games like Monopoly, Candy Land and Scrabble and creates deluxe versions of them. Its most popular line of games come in boxes that look like vintage books and sell for $40.",
      "The company\u2019s games were featured in Oprah\u2019s Favorite Things list in 2024 and sold in 14,000 stores in North America, from big national chains to mom-and-pop stores, said owner Jonathan Silva, whose father founded the company in 2000.",
      "All of WS Game\u2019s production is done in China. The tariffs have brought the past 25 years of healthy growth to a screeching halt.",
      "Over the past three weeks, WS Game has had three containers of finished games, worth $500,000, stranded in China. It lost orders from three of the largest U.S. retailers totaling $16 million in business. And there\u2019s not much Silva can do about it.",
      "\u201cAs a small business, we don\u2019t have the runway or the capabilities to move manufacturing on a whim,\u201d said Silva, who has 22 employees. He said the tariffs have \u201cdisrupted our business and put us on the verge of insolvency\u201d and estimates he has about a four-month runway to stay afloat if nothing changes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really hoping that cooler heads prevail,\u201d he said.",
      "Jeremy Rice co-owns House, a home-d\u00e9cor shop in Lexington, Kentucky, that specializes in artificial flower arrangements for the home. About 90% of the flowers his business uses are made in China.",
      "Rice uses dozens of vendors. The largest are absorbing some of the cost of the tariffs and passing on the rest. One vendor is raising prices by 20% and another 25%. But Rice is expecting smaller vendors to increase prices by much higher percentages.",
      "House offers mid-range artificial flowers. A large hydrangea head will retail for $10 to $16, for example. China is the only place that manufacturers higher quality silk flowers. It would take a vendor years to open a factory in a different country or move production somewhere else, Rice said.",
      "Rice ordered his holiday d\u00e9cor early this year. But even after stocking up ahead of the tariffs, he only has enough everyday floral inventory in to last two to three months.",
      "\u201cAfter that, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Rice is concerned that the trade war will wipe out a bunch of mom-and-pop stores, similar to what happened in the Great Recession and the pandemic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to turn, there\u2019s nothing to do,\u201d he said.",
      "A tea shop in a Michigan college town is also caught in the middle of the ongoing tariff fight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically just put a big pit in my stomach,\u201d said Lisa McDonald, owner of TeaHaus, located in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan. McDonald has owned TeaHaus for nearly 18 years and sells tea to customers across the U.S.",
      "Americans drank about 86 billion servings of tea in 2024, according to the Tea Association of the U.S.A.. Almost all of that is imported since tea isn\u2019t grown in the U.S. at scale, due to factors ranging from climate to cost.",
      "McDonald imports loose-leaf tea from China, India, Kenya, Sri Lanka and other countries. She says her customer base is \u201cfrom all over the U.S. and the world.\" But she worries there is a limit to what they\u2019ll spend. Her premium teas can cost up to $33 for a 50-gram bag.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I can charge $75 for a 50-gram bag of tea, no matter how amazing that tea is,\u201d she said.",
      "McDonald understands Trump\u2019s rationale for wanting to use tariffs to spur U.S. manufacturing but says it doesn\u2019t apply to the tea industry.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t grow tea in the U.S. to the extent that we need. We can\u2019t just flip the industry and \u2018make tea great again\u2019 in America. It just can\u2019t happen,\u201d she said.",
      "Jim Umlauf\u2019s business, 4Knines, based in Oklahoma City, makes vehicle seat covers and cargo liners for dog owners and others. To do so, he needs raw materials such as fabric, coatings and components from China.",
      "Umlauf has explored manufacturing in countries other than China since 2018, when Trump first instituted a 25% tariff on goods from China, but has run into complications. In the meantime, 4Knines absorbs the extra cost, which Umlauf says has limited its growth and squeezed its margins.",
      "Now, the new tariffs make it nearly impossible to do business. The demand is there, but the company can\u2019t afford to bring over more products.",
      "\u201cWe only have a limited amount of inventory left, and without some relief, we\u2019ll run out soon,\u201d Umlauf said.",
      "As a small business owner who has worked hard to develop a high-quality brand, create jobs and contribute to the community, Umlauf is frustrated. He has tried to contact the White House and other decision-makers to ask for small business support. But he's gotten zero response.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for policymakers to consider the full impact of trade policies not just on stock prices or global competitiveness, but on the real people running small businesses,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "A Texas judge has thrown out a federal rule that would have capped credit card late fees at $8",
      "NEW YORK -- A Texas judge earlier this month threw out a federal rule that would have capped credit card late fees at $8.",
      "The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau finalized the rule last year as part of the Biden administration's efforts to do away with what it called junk fees. It was paused by the courts before it could take effect.",
      "At the time, the CFPB estimated that American families would have saved more than $10 billion in late fees annually had the fees been capped at $8, significantly less than the $32 average.",
      "Banks and industry groups argued that the rule didn't allow card issuers to charge fees high enough to deter late payments and discourage repeat violations.",
      "The Texas judge's ruling earlier this month came a day after a collection of major industry groups and the CFPB under President Donald Trump announced that they had reached an agreement to throw out the rule.",
      "Here's what to know about credit card late fees:",
      "The average late fee for major issuers has steadily ticked up since the 2010s, going from $23 at the end of 2010 to $32 in 2022, according to the CFPB. WalletHub, which tracks financial data, found the average late fee in 2025 to be $30.50, with the maximum $41.",
      "A September 2023 Consumer Reports study estimated that 1 in 5 American adults, or about 52 million people, paid a credit card late fee in the previous year. People with lower incomes pay proportionately bigger fees, according to the CFPB, with the highest burden falling on communities of color and those living paycheck to paycheck.",
      "Enrolling in auto-pay for your credit cards can help you avoid making late payments, and there are some credit cards that don't charge late fees at all (though it's important to note that these cards may have other fee or penalty structures, or higher interest rates.)",
      "Citi Simplicity and the Apple card do not currently charge late fees, and Discover offers a card that will automatically waive the first late fee.",
      "It's also possible to appeal credit card late fees charged by your credit card company by calling them directly. The companies will often reverse the fees, especially if it's your first late payment.",
      "You may also want to consider making payments on your credit card balances during the month. That means you'll have paid more of the balance by the time the amount comes due, and keeping your balance low relative to your credit limit can improve your credit score.",
      "If you're having trouble making ends meet, you can ask your credit issuers about hardship programs. These are typically available to people affected by job loss, illness or medical conditions, natural disasters, or other emergencies.",
      "Concerned that credit card companies were building a business model based on high penalties, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (CARD Act), which banned the companies from charging excessive late fees and established clearer disclosures and consumer protections.",
      "In 2010, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors voted to issue a regulation implementing the CARD Act, which said that banks could only charge fees to recover costs associated with late payment.",
      "However, the rule included an \u201cimmunity provision\u201d that let some banks charge $25 for the first late payment and $35 for subsequent late payments, adjusted for inflation each year. Those amounts subsequently grew to $30 and $41.",
      "After a review of market data, the CFPB finalized a rule that would have capped late fees at $8 and ended automatic inflation adjustments. Based on records analyzed by the CFPB, a late fee of $8 would be sufficient for card issuers, on average, to cover collection costs incurred as a result of late payments.",
      "Industry groups, including the Consumer Bankers Association, American Bankers Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and others, said they welcomed the court's decision eliminating the cap.",
      "The groups said that the rule would have led to higher interest rates and reduced credit access for card holders. The groups also said the rule would have \u201creduced important incentives for consumers to manage their finances.\u201d",
      "The CFPB has estimated that banks bring in roughly $14 billion in credit card late fees a year.",
      "Horacio M\u00e9ndez, president and CEO of Woodstock Institute, an organization for advancing economic equity, called the ruling a \u201cdevastating blow.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy tossing out the CFPB\u2019s common-sense rule to cap these predatory late fees \u2014 some as high as $41 \u2014 a federal judge is putting corporations over the lives of everyday consumers,\" he said. \u201cThe CFPB\u2019s rule was borne out of clear evidence: the credit card industry was using inflated late fees as a profit engine, forcing families with the least financial cushion to pay.\u201d",
      "M\u00e9ndez said that while consumers have come to expect fees for services, those fees needn't be punitive to be effective.",

      "Trump has paused some of his steepest tariffs on most American partners for 90 days after global financial markets melted down. But he has raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, drawing rebukes from Beijing, which has vowed to \"fight to the end.\u201d U.S. companies are warning of higher prices, meaning Trump could face both higher inflation and empty store shelves.",
      "The magnitude of the taxes are already dramatically affecting American imports, with the shipping containers set to arrive at the Port of Los Angeles down nearly 36% over the past two weeks, according to Port Optimizer, which tracks vessels. It's lending urgency for both the U.S. and China to bolster support from alternate partners.",
      "While Trump administration officials suggest the president could ease the duty rates on Chinese goods at his discretion, there has been no indication he's yet looking for a reduction. That, after all, could suggest his protectionist policies were hurting the American economy.",
      "\u201cThey want to make a deal obviously,\" Trump told reporters Sunday, saying the U.S. had gone \u201ccold turkey\u201d on trade from China. \u201cRight now, they\u2019re not doing business with us.\u201d",
      "The White House has framed any negotiations as being between the U.S. president and Chinese President Xi Jinping, but neither leader seems willing to make the initial outreach without some kind of concession. The two countries can't even agree publicly whether they are holding talks.",
      "Earlier this month, Xi \u2014 on his first foreign trip this year \u2014 visited Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, resulting in mutual pledges for closer economic and trade ties. In Vietnam, which faces the 46% tariff from the U.S., Beijing and Hanoi agreed to strengthen industrial and supply chain cooperation. In Malaysia and Cambodia, Xi secured similar agreements. Cambodia is faced with a 49% tariff from the U.S., and Malaysia 24%.",
      "Then there's Japan: Despite its long-standing enmity towards the nation that once colonized parts of it, the Chinese government has reached out to Tokyo and urged a coordinated response, according to Kyodo News.",
      "China is ready to use the stick, too. A South Korean newspaper has reported that China is demanding South Korean businesses not to ship goods containing China's rare earth minerals to U.S. defense companies or face likely sanctions.",
      "Earlier this month, Beijing warned that no country should reach a deal with the U.S. at China's expense and vowed to take countermeasures in a \u201cresolute and reciprocal manner\u201d should such a situation arise.",
      "Hal Brands, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, said China will \u201ctry to exploit Trump's abrasive behavior to make inroads with U.S. allies and countries in the Global South.\u201d",
      "Some scholars say Beijing is already gaining. \u201cPeople lost the confidence, or even trust, for the United States, particularly for Donald Trump in the U.S. Not for China,\u201d said Li Cheng, professor of political science at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cSo in that regard, China gains in the geopolitical landscape.\u201d",
      "In the latest Ipsos poll, for the first time, more people globally now say China has a positive impact on the world than the United States. The pollster cited the broad backlash to Trump's tariffs.",
      "China is the world\u2019s largest exporter and the U.S. the largest importer. Total trade for China reached a record 43.85 trillion yuan (US$6 trillion) in 2024, and the country is the biggest trading partner for most of the world, including the European Union, Japan, South Korea and the grouping of the 10 Southeast Asian countries known as ASEAN.",
      "The U.S. is the biggest destination for China\u2019s exports, though China is only the third-largest trading partner with the U.S., behind Mexico and Canada. Total trade for the U.S. last year was US$5.4 billion, with a record deficit of $1.2 trillion. For ASEAN countries, trade with the U.S. totaled $477 billion in 2024, including $352 billion worth of goods sold to the U.S. But China does more business with ASEAN.",
      "Countries caught between the U.S. and China are in \u201can impossible situation\u201d because they need to stay economically connected both to China, \"a source of a lot of their input and imports\u201d and to the powerhouse U.S. market, said Matthew Goodman, director of the Greenberg Center for Geoeconomic Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cThey cannot choose one or the other, because they need both,\u201d Goodman said.",
      "In Europe, China is preparing to lift sanctions to revive a trade deal, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. Chinese state media have been calling on European leaders to join China in safeguarding the multilateralism.",
      "Back in Beijing, Xi has been receiving foreign leaders. On Thursday, he told Kenya's president that China\u2019s market has always kept its door open to high-quality products from Kenya and that China encourages more capable Chinese enterprises to invest and start businesses in Kenya, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. On Wednesday, Xi met Azerbaijan's president. Xi criticized the trade war as undermining the rights and interests of all countries.",
      "On Friday, when Xi presided over a key economic meeting, Beijing\u2019s leadership struck a positive tone but acknowledged \u201cincreasing impact from external shocks\u201d and \u201curged preparing for worst-case scenarios with sufficient planning,\u201d according to Xinhua.",
      "Wang Yiwei, a senior fellow at Beijing's Center for China and Globalization, said China, after dealing with Trump's first term, is prepared for his latest tariff approach. \u201cChina is prepared for the worst,\u201d Wang said, \u201cand it is no longer living in the fantasy of globalization.\u201d",
      "Victor Gao, vice president of the Center for China and Globalization, said Beijing is prepared for decoupling. \u201cWhat will be the end? It's a complete halt, meaning no more U.S exports to China, no more China exports to the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "And, despite high costs to China's economy, China will survive, Gao said. \u201cFor a country especially like China with a history of 5,000 years, what kind of people have we not seen? Whatever invaders, robbers, and barbarians,\u201d Gao said. \u201cBut at the end, they all leave. They all disappear, all get defeated.\"",

      "Horror movies are often one-week wonders at the box office, but Ryan Coogler\u2019s\u201cSinners\u201d is defying the odds and proving to be true event cinema.",
      "In its second weekend in theaters, \u201cSinners\u201d earned $45 million in ticket sales from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. That\u2019s down a miniscule 6% from its Easter holiday launch, the smallest drop in any genre since \u201cAvatar\u201d in 2009. Worldwide, \u201cSinners\u201d has now made $161.6 million.",
      "For the industry, the showing proves the film's reach has broadened beyond horror fans to mainstream audiences wanting to see what the hype is about. Last weekend, men made up 56% of the audience. This weekend, the gender divide narrowed to 50/50. Premium large format showings, like the 70mm IMAX screens, are also a big draw. IMAX screens worldwide accounted for some 21% of the second weekend globally, a nearly 9% increase from last weekend.",
      "The original ensemble movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as twins, rode into theaters on a wave of great reviews. And, to be fair, \u201cSinners\u201d isn\u2019t simply a horror film: It blends elements of drama, action and musical into its southern gothic milieu.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of the lowest second weekend holds for an overperforming wide release ever,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute phenomenon.\"",
      "Hollywood expects significant drop off in a movie's second week of release. Even a 50% dip is considered a solid number, baked into the movie math. When it's anything less than that, it's notable.",
      "\u201cYou can buy a great opening weekend with marketing, but if a movie doesn\u2019t have the goods, it\u2019ll drop off,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThere's no greater barometer of success than a second weekend hold like this.\"",
      "The film was produced by Coogler\u2019s Proximity Media and Warner Bros., which handled the theatrical release. After some disappointments earlier in the year, it's the second major win for the studio after \u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d helped energize the box office earlier this month.",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d easily topped the biggest new competition this week: \u201cThe Accountant 2,\u201d a sequel starring Ben Affleck and released by Amazon MGM Studios, which opened in third place with an estimated $24.5 million in its first weekend. Gavin O'Connor directed the film, which played in 3,610 theaters in North America. Audiences gave it a promising A- CinemaScore.",
      "The film that beat \u201cThe Accountant 2\u201d for second place was a 20-year-old Star Wars movie: \u201cRevenge of the Sith.\u201d The anniversary re-release took in an estimated $25.2 million over the weekend, with many sellouts reported, more than doubling last year\u2019s release of \u201cThe Phantom Menace.\u201d Internationally, it earned $17 million from 34 territories, giving it a $42.2 million global weekend. It's one of the top grossing re-releases ever.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie\u201d landed in fourth place with $22.7 million, bringing its domestic total to around $380 million.",
      "The scary video game adaptation \u201cUntil Dawn\u201d also opened this weekend to an estimated $8 million. Sony Pictures released the film, starring Ella Rubin and Michael Cimino, which has earned $18.1 million globally.",
      "The \u201cMinecraft\u201d and \u201cSinners\u201d wins have meant a huge boost for the April box office, which is up 102% from April 2024. The annual box office is also up over 10% from last year after running at a double-digit deficit in March. And this is all happening right before the industry\u2019s summer movie season kicks off on May 2 with Disney\u2019s \u201cThunderbolts(asterisk).\u201d",

      "The U.S. coal industry has been in a steep decline for decades, and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has proposed several changes that would affect it",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- President Donald Trump's administration has proposed several changes that would affect the struggling U.S. coal industry.",
      "Trump issued executive orders this month to allow mining on federal land. He has used his emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep producing electricity to meet the rising demand amid the growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars.",
      "The Republican president also granted nearly 70 older coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals.",
      "Trump's government efficiency team, run by Elon Musk, made plans earlier this year to terminate the leases of 34 U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration offices in 19 states.",
      "The coal industry once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production. But it has been in steep decline for decades as operators went out of business and utilities installed more renewable energy and converted coal-fired plants to be fueled by cheaper and cleaner-burning natural gas.",
      "U.S. coal production was at 1 billion tons (907,000 metric tons) in 2014 and fell to 578 million tons (524 million metric tons) by 2023, the latest year available, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Coal employment nationally peaked in the 1920s when there were about 900,000 miners. It was at about 350,000 in 1950 and has declined steadily since 1980. After the coronavirus pandemic, employment rebounded from 2022 to 2023, rising 4.2% to 45,476. West Virginia employed the most miners at 14,000, followed by Kentucky at 5,000. About half of the nation\u2019s 560 coal mines are located in West Virginia (165) and Kentucky (112). Despite having just 15 mines, Wyoming was the highest-producing coal state due to mechanization and more accessible coal.",
      "Mining fatalities over the past four decades have dropped significantly. There have been 11 or fewer deaths in each of the past five years, according to MSHA.",
      "MSHA is responsible for enforcing U.S. mine safety laws. It is required to inspect each underground mine quarterly and each surface mine twice a year. The cuts proposed by Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency would require MSHA inspectors to travel farther to get to a mine, and that could mean less thorough inspections, said Jack Spadaro, a longtime mine safety investigator and environmental specialist who worked for that agency.",
      "According to the DOGE website, ending the MSHA leases is projected to save $18 million. It is unclear whether inspectors\u2019 positions and other jobs from those offices would be moved to other facilities.",
      "Seven of the MSHA offices set for closing are in Kentucky and four are in Pennsylvania. West Virginia is among the states with two targeted offices. Also under consideration for closure are the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement facilities in Lexington, Kentucky, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, shrinking the national footprint of an agency created during the Carter administration to restore land damaged by strip mining, and reclaim abandoned and damaged mine lands.",
      "A recent review of publicly available data by the Appalachian Citizens\u2019 Law Center indicates that nearly 17,000 health and safety inspections were conducted from the beginning of 2024 through February 2025 by MSHA staff in the facilities on the chopping block.",
      "Industry advocates have long contended that there are other uses for coal, some of which use cleaner technology.",
      "Canonsburg, Pennsylvania-based Core Natural Resources is working to develop a process using West Virginia coal to create a synthetic material that can be used as an anode for lithium-ion batteries, reducing U.S. dependence on countries such as China, according to Matthew Mackowiak, the company\u2019s director of government affairs.",
      "Core recently acquired a company that turns coal into carbon foam that produces composite tooling used to make nose cones and plane wings for the U.S. defense industry.",
      "\u201cWhether or not there is any more coal-fired generation in the future, obviously that\u2019s something else to talk about in the future,\u201d Mackowiak said. \u201cBut at the very least, we need to be focused on maintaining our current coal fleet.\u201d",

      "EAGAN, Minn. -- While everyone else in the NFL 's record crop of first-round quarterbacks in the draft last year launched their careers on the field, J.J. McCarthy was forced to begin his with film study and in the training room for the Minnesota Vikings.",
      "McCarthy would hardly consider that a wasted season, even though the torn meniscus in his right knee made him the first quarterback selected in the first round since the common draft era began in 1967 to not play any games as a rookie because of injury.",
      "His gratitude journal helped take care of that.",
      "\u201cThe little things that go overlooked and underappreciated when you are healthy and you can walk, or even the ability to see. I feel like that\u2019s been a great anchor for me every single morning, along with my meditation, to kind of put great perspective into my days and jump-start my day,\u201d McCarthy said, reflecting on the practice he started in college at Michigan and resumed after he was hurt in the team\u2019s first exhibition game and needed surgery four days later.",
      "McCarthy was moving around crisply on the indoor practice field on Tuesday with a group of offensive players, wearing a backward hat and a recurring smile a session in the first phase of the offseason conditioning program that was briefly opened to reporters. He said he feels better than he did before the injury in August.",
      "\u201cI felt like I was back the second I started throwing. I was itching to be out there and get after it, and kind of always felt better than what I was supposed to feel,\u201d McCarthy said in his first interview with local media since Sept. 6.",
      "The Vikings mulled in March the bold move of bringing in Aaron Rodgers, but they ultimately decided to table that as an emergency option down the road and solidify their commitment to McCarthy.",
      "When Sam Darnold signed with Seattle and Daniel Jones and Nick Mullens also departed in free agency, the Vikings were left with just Brett Rypien behind McCarthy. Considering Rodgers made sense without any significant experience at the position, but a four-time NFL MVP wasn\u2019t going to be a backup. The Vikings settled on a trade for Sam Howell, who started all 17 games for Washington in 2023 and was with Seattle last season.",
      "\u201cObviously I respect Aaron Rodgers, one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play the game, but all I was focusing on was that day-to-day task, what I was doing here, what I was doing at home just to kind of make myself the best overall player I can be,\u201d McCarthy said.",
      "The Vikings have made significant enhancements to an offense that finished ninth in the NFL in points and 12th in yards last season, committing more than $53 million guaranteed to bring in right guard Will Fries and center Ryan Kelly as free agents from Indianapolis. They re-signed running back Aaron Jones and acquired a young and promising backup, Jordan Mason, in a trade with San Francisco. Then they drafted left guard Donovan Jackson in the first round last week and wide receiver Tai Felton in the third round.",
      "Coming off a 14-win season, the Vikings are clearly in win-now mode even with a quarterback who's never taken a snap in a game that counts.",
      "\u201cI know I\u2019m ready to start, because of all the work that I put in and just the confidence in my skills and abilities,\u201d McCarthy said.",
      "Last week, coach Kevin O'Connell offered his latest praise of McCarthy's commitment to the \u201cinvisible habits\u201d of completing his rehab and soaking up as much as he can from a strategic standpoint. After slimming down to below 190 pounds before he ramped up his weight-room work, McCarthy is back to his ideal weight of about 215 pounds.",
      "There will be immense pressure on McCarthy to succeed this season with a championship-ready roster around him. Living with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder since he was a kid, McCarthy has long found calm and confidence in the chaos.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s where I feel most comfortable, where the lights are the brightest, the stage is the biggest out there,\u201d he said, \u201cand I know there\u2019s going to be a lot more of that to come.\u201d",

      "The only advantage from earning those slightly higher seeds is arriving now: The Lakers and Rockets both get to play at home in Game 5 \u2014 and in Game 7, if either makes it that far.",
      "\u201cWe have to play with a sense of desperation,\u201d Redick said. \u201cCan\u2019t change what\u2019s already happened, and you can\u2019t feel sorry for yourself.\u201d",
      "The big-picture reasons why the Lakers and Rockets find themselves in this predicament are clear, and even logical.",
      "That won't make first-round exits any easier to swallow if they can't rally from this daunting deficit.",
      "The Lakers are still building their identity and teamwork after the midseason trade to land Doncic. Their new Slovenian superstar only played 21 games alongside LeBron James during the regular season \u2014 hardly enough time to figure out a consistent winning approach, as Los Angeles is learning in the first round against Anthony Edwards and the more tested Wolves.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have much practice together, so it\u2019s hard to get the chemistry on the court, but I think we\u2019re ready for it,\u201d Doncic said. \u201cWe could have won some games (in the series). Little mistakes cost us, but we\u2019re still confident we can win, and we\u2019re going to go after (it with) everything.\u201d",
      "The Rockets got back in the playoffs after a four-season absence with a revitalizing season under coach Ime Udoka. Houston won 52 games despite lacking a top-25 scorer and relying largely on defensive intensity \u2014 but that formula hasn't looked like enough to take four games from Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler.",
      "When/where to watch: Game 5, 7:30 p.m. EDT (TNT)",
      "BetMGM says: Rockets by 4.5",
      "The Warriors seized control of this feisty series Monday night by taking over in the fourth quarter. Butler did much of the work while playing through injury, scoring 23 points in the second half and 14 in the final period.",
      "For all their toughness, the Rockets' lack of a top offensive player was glaring in Game 4. Leading scorer Jalen Green didn't get a bucket in the fourth quarter \u2014 not even taking a shot during the 7:02 he spent on the court \u2014 and finished with just eight points.",
      "Yet the Rockets will draw hope from the fact they kept it close, with Fred VanVleet missing a 3-pointer at the buzzer.",
      "Houston is hoping a return home will spark Green, who hit eight 3-pointers and scored 38 points in the Rockets' Game 2 victory.",
      "When/where to watch: Game 5, 10 p.m. EDT (TNT)",
      "BetMGM says: Lakers by 5.5",
      "Los Angeles is staggered after back-to-back losses at Minnesota despite leading in the fourth quarter of both games, including a seven-point advantage with five minutes left in Game 4. At least the Lakers are back in their downtown arena, where they compiled the NBA's third-best home record this season \u2014 although that didn't help in Game 1, which the Wolves won handily.",
      "Edwards criticized the intensity of the Lakers\u2019 home crowd earlier in the series, but he decided after Game 4 that Los Angeles\u2019 downtown arena is a difficult place to play after all.",
      "\u201cI told them it\u2019s going to be the toughest game that we\u2019ve played all season, all series, because everyone is going to be against us,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be 300,000 people and then the Timberwolves, 12 players and the coaches and the people in the organization that travels with us. Back against the wall in enemy territory. These are the moments that we should live for \u2014 going on the road and trying to close a team out. It\u2019s going to be tough, going to be a tough atmosphere, but it should be fun. If you like competing at the highest level, I told them it should be fun.\u201d",
      "Edwards thought the Lakers looked tired in the fourth quarter of Game 4 after Redick curiously played the same five players for the entire second half \u2014 and many Lakers fans thought Edwards was correct, exposing Redick to some of the most significant criticism he has faced in his successful rookie season.",
      "Redick rejected that notion Tuesday, instead suggesting the Lakers' poor execution down the stretch in their 19-point fourth quarter of Game 4 \u2014 with none of those points from James \u2014 were symptomatic of a fourth-quarter malaise throughout the series.",
      "\u201cLooking back now, what did we score, 19, 20, 13 in the fourth quarter (of the first three games)?\u201d Redick asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend. More so than that, our two best players missed layups at the rim (in Game 4). I don\u2019t think they missed layups because they were tired.\u201d",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Milwaukee Bucks coach Doc Rivers has learned to take 10-time NBA All-Star Damian Lillard at his word.",
      "So when Rivers spoke with his injured 34-year-old star guard Tuesday, he wasn't surprised to hear Lillard's reaction to the torn left Achilles tendon that knocked him out of this year's first-round playoff series against Indiana.",
      "\u201cHe said two things, which I love,\" Rivers said. \"The first one, he just said \u2018I can\u2019t believe I'm here.' Then the second one is \u2018I'm not going out this way.' I can guarantee you he won't, and that's what I meant about his resolve.\u201d",
      "Lillard suffered a non-contact injury Sunday night in Game 4 of the Bucks series against Indiana. He was behind the 3-point line, near the top of the key, midway through the first quarter when the ball bounced toward him. Lillard used his left hand to tip the ball toward teammate Gary Trent Jr., then went down and grabbed the lower part of his left leg.",
      "He remained seated as play continued and needed help \u2014 both to get up and to leave the court. Milwaukee lost the game 129-103, putting the Bucks in a 3-1 deficit and on the brink of a third straight first-round exit. The series resumes Tuesday night in Indianapolis.",
      "Lillard's absence is a huge blow, especially after the seven-time All-NBA selection fought so hard to return just a month after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right calf \u2014 an ailment that typically takes months to recover from, not weeks.",
      "Then in his third game back, Lillard got hurt again. this time with an injury that could keep him out of a significant portion of next season and potentially end his pairing with two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo. The tandem has appeared in just three playoff games over their two seasons as teammates.",
      "But Lillard is determined to come back as quickly as possible.",
      "\u201cIt's amazing,\u201d Rivers said. \u201cHe's already talking about his return and being better and being ready. We had a long talk about that today as well.\u201d",
      "Lillard didn't look like his typically explosive self in any of the three games against the Pacers. He averaged 7.0 points, 4.7 assists and 2.7 rebounds in those games compared with the 31.3 points he scored in last year's 4-2 series loss to the Pacers and the 18.3 points and 9.3 assists he averaged in this season's' four regular-season games against Indiana.",
      "He ranked 10th in the NBA in scoring (24.9) and 10th in assists (7.1) this season.",
      "After Sunday\u2019s game, the Pacers players who had sparred verbally with Lillard through the first three games of the series also sent their best to Lillard.",
      "Rivers opted to shake up his starting lineup Tuesday by inserting guards A.J. Green and Kevin Porter Jr., as well as forward Bobby Portis Jr. Trent also returns to the starting lineup.",
      "Lillard's latest absence is yet the latest chapter in some bad postseason luck for the Bucks since winning their 2021 title.",
      "A knee injury kept Khris Middleton out of the entire seven-game Eastern Conference semifinal loss to Boston in 2022. Antetokounmpo bruised his lower back in Game 1 and missed the next two games before returning in a 2023 first-round series loss to Miami. Antetokounmpo also missed all six games against Indiana in 2024 with a strained calf.",

      "Kittle announced the deal on the \u201cBussin' With The Boys\u201d podcast on Tuesday, saying the extension was worth $76.4 million over four years with $35 million guaranteed at signing. The deal keeps Kittle under contract with San Francisco through the 2029 season.",

He is an outstanding representation for the 49ers on the field and is an outstanding representative for the organization off the field with his investment in the local and military communities. He has a great sense of pride in his role and has put in the work to be one of the best tight ends in the NFL.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old Kittle was entering the final year of a five-year, $75 million extension that he signed in 2020. Kittle didn't show up for the first few days of the team's voluntary offseason program last week but arrived later in the week in a sign that a deal could get done soon.",
      "The $19.1 million average annual value of the extension tops the previous record for a tight end of $19 million set earlier this offseason when Trey McBride signed an extension with Arizona. The $35 million guaranteed to Kittle at the signing of the deal is also the most for any tight end.",

      "Kittle has been a first or second-team All-Pro five times in eight seasons and has made six Pro Bowls. His four seasons with at least 1,000 yards receiving ranks tied for the second most of all time for a tight end, trailing only the seven for Kansas City's Travis Kelce.",
      "Kittle was a second-team All-Pro last season when he had 78 catches for 1,106 yards and eight TDs. Since being drafted in the fifth round in 2017, Kittle has had 538 catches for 7,380 yards and 45 TDs. He has the second-most yards ever for a tight end through eight seasons.",

      "\u201cFollowing a thorough police investigation and a comprehensive review of all the evidence by the CPS, we have concluded that there is not a realistic prospect of conviction for any criminal offence and so there will not be a prosecution. Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Adam Johnson.\u201d",
      "After his arrest, Petgrave had been re-bailed several times while the investigation took place.",

      "Johnson was living with fianc\u00e9e Ryan Wolfe and studying at Loughborough Business School.",

      "Rajasthan, which won the inaugural edition of IPL in 2008, has a history of nurturing cricketing talent. Suryavanshi was born a year after Yousuf Pathan hit the then fastest century in IPL in 2010 off 37 balls for Rajasthan against Mumbai Indians.",
      "Pathan was quick to congratulate the youngster for breaking his record for fastest IPL hundred by an Indian.",
      "\u201cEven more special to see it happen while playing for ( rajasthanroyals ), just like I did. There\u2019s truly something magical about this franchise for youngsters,\" Pathan posted on X. \"Long way to go, champ.\u201d",
      "Royals batting coach Vikram Rathore knew what Suryavanshi was capable of doing at top level cricket after watching him practice a few months ago, and quickly figured it was important to nurture him.",
      "\u201cTo do it in front of this kind of crowd and in a situation like this against a really, really good bowling attack, I think it was really special and a lot of credit to him,\u201d Rathore said. \u201cHe has a solid head on his his shoulders. Today was an extraordinary innings.\u201d",
      "Rathore was careful, though, not to pile too much pressure on his young star by comparing him with the great Sachin Tendulkar.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too early to say that and it\u2019s unfair I think on the kid to compare him to Sachin Tendulkar,\" he told the post-game news conference. \"As I said he\u2019s a new Vaibhav Suryavansh. He\u2019s a special kid and he\u2019s a special talent. If he keeps working hard he\u2019ll have a special place in Indian cricket I\u2019m sure.\u201d",
      "Tendulkar, who transformed from teenage talent into an iconic figure and the leading international scorer in the sport, was impressed with Suryavanshi's innings.",
      "The cricket fraternity, including stars from other IPL franchises, praised the talent of the youngest player to score a century in a professional T20 league, and the second-fastest in the history of the IPL.",
      "\u201cWitnessed this carnage of an innings by this youngster. Absolutely insane!\u201d Suryakumar Yadav of Mumbai Indians posted on X.",
      "Former India batter Yuvraj Singh was impressed with the fearless attitude of Suryavanshi.",
      "\u201cWhat were you doing at 14? This kid is taking on the best bowlers in the world without blinking an eyelid!\u201d Yuvraj posted to his 6.4 million followers on X. \u201cVaibhav Suryavanshi -- remember the name! Playing with a fearless attitude Proud to see the next generation shine!\u201d",
      "With the likes of Rahul Dravid and Rathore around him at Rajasthan, Suryavanshi could easily be fast tracked into international cricket.",
      "IPL commentator and ex-West Indies international cricket Ian Bishop said Suryavanshi needs to be surrounded by the right people so that he doesn\u2019t fade out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented, 14 years old. This is new territory,\" Bishop said. \"The scrutiny on him when he plays the next game, and if he doesn\u2019t score any runs, you know, there are going to be detractors out there \u2026 this kid is going to be tested.",
      "\"His parents are going to have to be so close to him, and hopefully \u2014 I'm sure they are great parents \u2014 you\u2019ve got to surround this kid with proper people for the next five years to ensure this high that he\u2019s got so early in his career, there isn\u2019t a drop.\u201d",
      "Suryavanshi made his first class debut for Bihar in northeast India in January 2024.",
      "\u201cVaibhav has shown the world the immense talent that lies hidden in the soil of Bihar,\u201d his father Sanjeev Suryavanshi said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cToday, Bihar stands tall with pride. Our entire family and people across Bihar are overjoyed by this accomplishment.\u201d",

      "MADRID -- Power was restored at the Caja Magica tennis complex Tuesday and the Madrid Open resumed with a packed schedule that included second-ranked Iga Swiatek advancing to the quarterfinals.",
      "Swiatek defeated Diana Shnaider 6-0, 6-7 (3), 6-4 to stay on track to defend her title in the Spanish capital.",
      "After a major blackout that prompted 22 matches to be postponed on Monday, most parts of Madrid regained power overnight. But the Caja Magica was still without electricity early Tuesday, causing a delay in the opening of the gates for fans.",
      "However, the power came back quickly, and organizers did not have to alter the day\u2019s schedule of matches, although there was the possibility of the night session being delayed because of the high number of matches during the day.",

      "It will be Swiatek's first meeting with Keys since she lost despite having match point in the semifinals of the Australian Open.",
      "In the men's side, sixth-seeded Alex de Minaur tied Carlos Alcaraz with a tour-leading 24th win this season by getting past Denis Shapovalov 6-3, 7-6 (3).",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got tremendous firepower from every part of the court, and I had to do my best to neutralize it, and not let him dictate as much as he could,\u201d De Minaur said.",
      "Americans Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe both won their matches. The 11th-seeded Paul defeated Karen Khachanov 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, while the 16th-seeded Tiafoe beat Alexandre Muller 6-3, 6-3.",
      "Paul was among the players having to play doubles on the same day as their singles matches. Another was 19-year-old Jakub Mensic, who defeated Alexander Bublik 6-3, 6-2 before having to play his doubles match on the same court a bit later.",
      "There were huge lines outside the complex, and people with tickets for Monday's matches were not allowed back in on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cNobody said anything yet,\u201d said Juan Duato, who was denied entry when he arrived on Monday during the power outage. \u201cThey said we couldn't come in and asked us to contact customer support. Apparently they will send us an email.\u201d",
      "Organizers said later Tuesday that anyone who purchased tickets for Monday would receive a full refund for the purchase. That process would be carried out automatically over the next few days.",
      "Fans already inside were asked to leave the Caja Magica a few hours after the outage happened shortly after 12:30 p.m. local time (1030 GMT) on Monday. Organizers said they wanted to \u201cguarantee the safety of the players, fans and personnel.\u201d",
      "Two ATP singles matches and one doubles match were underway at the time.",
      "Tuesday's schedule included second-ranked Alexander Zverev facing Francisco Cerundolo. On the women's side, the remaining six fourth-round matches were scheduled, including top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka facing Peyton Stearns.",

      "Saints quarterback Derek Carr has stated publicly for the first time that he has a shoulder injury",
      "METAIRIE, La. -- Saints quarterback Derek Carr stated publicly for the first time that he has a shoulder injury, but stopped short of disclosing any specifics about how or when it happened, or how it might affect his availability to play during the coming season.",
      "\u201cI hate that I have to say this, but I have to say this: Yes, I have a shoulder injury,\u201d Carr said while delivering a guest sermon at a church in Las Vegas on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI have an MRI report to prove it,\u201d Carr continued. \"The team knows about it. We\u2019ve been in constant communication. There\u2019s nothing wrong. We\u2019re figuring it out and we\u2019re going to go forward with that. Is that OK?\"",
      "\u201cI've been dealing with people lying about me ... and I'm like, \u2018Lord, why do I have to continue to deal with this nonsense?\u201d Carr continued. \"You never know what someone's really going through. And so why do we continually try to attack people \u2014 and I would say attack people that are maybe trying to do things the right way?\"",
      "Carr's sermon took place two days after the Saints used their second-round pick \u2014 the 40th overall \u2014 in this year's NFL draft, to select Louisville quarterback Tyler Shough.",
      "The Saints picked Shough two days after the club's general manager, Mickey Loomis, acknowledged publicly that Carr has \u201can issue\u201d with his shoulder about which the Saints are seeking more \u201cclarity.\u201d",
      "The issue first arose when NFL.com, citing an anonymous source, reported on April 11 that Carr might need shoulder surgery which could cause him to miss part or all of the upcoming season.",
      "The report did not state which shoulder Carr injured or how he injured it. Carr\u2019s agent, Timothy Younger, did not return multiple messages from The Associated Press about the matter. And until Wednesday, the Saints had not addressed it, either.",
      "Likewise, Loomis has declined to say when he first learned of the injury or explain his understanding of how it happened.",
      "Car, who is 14-13 in two seasons as a Saints starter, injured the AC joint in his throwing shoulder in 2023, but never missed a game because of it. Carr missed seven games in 2024, but because of oblique and hand injuries.",
      "The Saints\u2019 injury reports last season did not mention any issues with Carr\u2019s shoulder, and when he played, he had multiple downfield completions that went for 50 or more yards.",
      "But as Carr entered the third year of his four-year Saints contract, doubt surrounded his long-term future with the club because of a coaching change, his inconsistent play and apparent fan discontent.",
      "Carr was signed during the tenure of previous coach Dennis Allen, who was fired last season. The new coach is former Philadelphia offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, who is installing a new offense.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Players on the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets got into a shoving altercation midway through the second quarter in Monday night's Game 4 of their first-round playoff series, leading to three technical fouls before tempers flared again shortly before halftime.",
      "With the game tied at 36, Golden State star Stephen Curry dribbled down the sideline when teammate Draymond Green put a hard screen on Houston's Amen Thompson. Dillon Brooks appeared to become angry about the push and went at Curry and Green.",
      "Curry received a technical for \u201ctaunting\u201d Brooks, who also received a technical along with Green.",
      "Warriors rookie Quinten Post and Houston's Jabari Smith Jr. flailed their arms at each other but avoided technicals upon replay review by the officials.",
      "Then with 2:44 left in the quarter, Green received a Flagrant 1 foul for pushing Tari Eason's face to the ground and Eason also received a technical. Green was dribbling when Eason went for a steal and the ball got loose and both players hit the floor trying to corral it. Green's left leg was on the Rockets forward's neck.",
      "The Warriors lead the best-of-seven series 2-1.",
      "There was already bad blood between the teams. Jimmy Butler returned after missing Game 3 because of a pelvic contusion suffered in Game 2 on Wednesday on a hard foul by Thompson.",
      "Butler tried to secure a rebound when Thompson undercut him and sent the Warriors star\u2019s feet high into the air so that he came down straight onto his tailbone. Both players thudded to the floor and Butler grimaced in pain, grabbing at his backside. He stayed in briefly to shoot two free throws before going to the locker room.",
      "On Friday, Brooks defended Thompson and called Green a \u201cdirty\u201d player.",
      "\u201cDillon said that? Interesting,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.",
      "And while with Memphis three years ago, Brooks\u2019 Flagrant 2 foul on Gary Payton II during Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals of the Warriors\u2019 championship run in 2022 fractured Payton\u2019s elbow. He returned for Game 2 of Golden State\u2019s six-game NBA Finals victory over Boston.",
      "Payton made an open-court foul against Brooks during Game 3 and when asked about it afterward, he said with a smile, \u201cI didn\u2019t see it.\u201d",

      "MIAMI -- Cleveland moved into Round 2 with the most lopsided series win in NBA playoff history.",
      "Donovan Mitchell scored 22 points, De\u2019Andre Hunter added 19 and the Cavaliers led by as many as 60 points before beating the Miami Heat 138-83 on Monday night to sweep their Eastern Conference first-round series in four games.",
      "Ty Jerome had 18 points, Evan Mobley added 17 and Jarrett Allen had 14 points, 12 rebounds and six steals for the Cavaliers. Cleveland won the series by a combined 122 points, one more than the previous record for series margin set by Denver over New Orleans in 2009.",
      "\u201cWe came out here with a goal in mind,\" Mitchell said.",
      "The 55-point margin in Game 4 was the fourth-biggest playoff win ever. The record is 58 points, done twice: Minneapolis over St. Louis in 1956 and Denver over New Orleans in 2009. The Los Angeles Lakers beat Golden State by 56 points in 1973.",
      "Nikola Jovic led the Heat with 24 points. Ban Adebayo scored 13, while Pelle Larsson and Andrew Wiggins each added 12 for Miami.",

The 26-point margin matched the worst quarter in Heat playoff history; it was the second-best margin for any quarter in Cavs playoff history.",

      "Anton Lundell also scored and Carter Verhaeghe added an empty-netter. Sergei Bobrovsky stopped 18 shots.",
      "The Panthers had managed just three shots on goal in the third before Ekblad tied it with 3:47 remaining, sending the crowd at Amerant Bank Arena into a roar. Jones found the back of the net shortly after to go ahead and erase a two-goal deficit.",
      "The goals were the fastest by defensemen from the same team in Stanley Cup Playoffs history.",
      "Florida will now have a chance to clinch the series Wednesday night in Tampa.",
      "\u201cFrom Game 1 you could feel the hatred in the locker room,\" Jones said. \u201cYou could feel the hatred on the ice. But it\u2019s most importantly about winning. The job\u2019s not finished. We\u2019ve got to go to Tampa and have a good game.\u201d",
      "Tampa Bay's Brandon Hagel left in the second period after taking a high hit from Ekblad, who made contact with the left wing\u2019s chin area and sent him onto his back. Hagel went straight to the locker room and no penalty was called.",
      "Lundell got the Panthers on the board at 9:06 in the second after Florida had sent many good looks either too wide or high at goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy, who made 19 saves. Mitchell Chaffee and Erik Cernak responded for the Lightning with another pair of goals 11 seconds apart to make it 2-1 heading into the third.",
      "Ekblad had a tying goal overturned in the third after a successful challenge by the Lightning for offside, which kept the score at 2-1 before the defenseman, in just his second game back from a 20-game suspension, picked up a rebound and put it past Vasilevskiy.",
      "\u201cGood for him,\u201d said Florida coach Paul Maurice. \u201cThe first nongoal was a heater. And you've seen that from him. The tying goal, some great patience. So good for him, does a great job of getting up the ice and timing when to go in and to take that chance. So he's an important part of what we do.\u201d",
      "Hagel did not return after the hit from Ekblad, which happened before Tampa Bay's goals. Hagel was back from a one game suspension after his late hit knocked Panthers captain Aleksander Barkov out of Game 2.",
      "The play on Monday reflected the chippy nature of the series, which has had a somewhat controversial hit in three straight games. After Hagel\u2019s hit in Game 2, Florida\u2019s Matthew Tkachuk landed a late hit on Jake Guentzel in Game 3 and was assessed a five-minute major, though he was not suspended.",
      "Florida\u2019s Niko Mikkola was hit with a five-minute major and a game misconduct early in the third period Monday for boarding Zemgus Girgensons, who was on his knees.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s getting tiresome answering questions about a hit every single game,\u201d said Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper. \u201cWhy are you asking me the question? If anyone in here has something (to say), stand up and let me know.\u201d",
      "The Panthers were able to kill off that penalty, giving Florida the momentum it needed to mount a comeback.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Right-hander Tyler Glasnow has been placed on the 15-day injured list by the Los Angeles Dodgers with right shoulder inflammation in the latest setback for the defending World Series champions' perpetually injury-plagued pitching staff.",
      "Glasnow went on the IL one day after leaving his second straight start early due to shoulder discomfort Sunday. He allowed two homers in the first inning against Pittsburgh, but returned to warm up for the second inning before exiting.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said Monday that Glasnow developed \u201coverall body soreness\u201d in addition to his shoulder woes.",
      "\u201cThere's the mechanics piece of it, there's the uncomfortable, not feeling right,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAs Tyler said, very frustrating, and we're all just trying to get to the bottom of it.\u201d",
      "For the second consecutive season, Glasnow has joined an alarmingly long list of Dodgers pitchers with significant injury problems.",
      "Top-line starters Glasnow, Blake Snell (left shoulder inflammation) and Clayton Kershaw (recovery from toe and knee surgery) are on the injured list, along with Blake Treinen (right forearm tightness), Michael Kopech (right shoulder), Brusdar Graterol (right shoulder surgery) and several other relievers.",
      "\u201cPitching is certainly volatile,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe experienced it last year \u2014 I think every year. I think the thing that's probably most disconcerting is leading Major League Baseball in bullpen innings. I think that that's something the starters are built up to take those innings down, so that's sort of where my head is at, to make sure we don't red-line these guys.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-8 Glasnow has a lengthy injury history, but the Dodgers still signed him to a five-year, $136.5 million contract after acquiring the LA-area native from Tampa Bay in December 2023. Glasnow was solid to begin his debut season with the Dodgers, going 9-6 with a 3.49 ERA and a 0.95 WHIP \u2014 but he didn't pitch after Aug. 11, developing elbow tendinitis that kept him out of the postseason.",
      "Glasnow altered his delivery and his between-starts routine in an attempt to stay healthier, but he only got through five starts and 18 innings this season before his latest injury woes, going 1-0 with a 4.50 ERA.",
      "Snell, who got a $182 million free-agent deal from deep-pocketed Los Angeles last November, made only two starts for his new team before going on the shelf this month.",
      "The Dodgers used 17 starting pitchers during the 2024 regular season while their rotation was altered almost weekly by major injuries. Los Angeles won the World Series while relying on an October starting rotation of late-season acquisition Jack Flaherty, Yoshinobu Yamamoto (who missed three months of the regular season) and Walker Buehler (who also missed three months) along with multiple bullpen games.",
      "Flaherty and Buehler departed in free agency when the Dodgers declined to re-sign them. Gavin Stone, who led LA with 25 starts last season, is out for the entire 2025 season after right shoulder surgery.",
      "The Dodgers' high-priced starting rotation is thin yet again in 2025: LA will have to throw a bullpen game Tuesday against the Miami Marlins, while former All-Star right-hander Tony Gonsolin will return to the mound Wednesday to make his first start since August 2023 after recovering from Tommy John surgery.",
      "Gonsolin's return is part of the good news for the Dodgers' staff.",
      "Dustin May, Monday's starter, is also back in the rotation after missing two years with injuries, while Yamamoto and newcomer Roki Sasaki have remained healthy this month.",
      "And two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani is expected to make his Dodgers debut on the mound in the first half of this season, although the team hasn't set a timeline.",
      "Roberts isn't sure how he will fill out his rotation when the Dodgers begin a road trip with 10 games in 10 days on Friday in Atlanta. The Dodgers might stretch out reliever Ben Casparius, a longtime starting pitcher before he reached the majors.",
      "The Dodgers recalled right-handed reliever Noah Davis to fill Glasnow's roster spot.",

      "In the White House and the Republican-led Congress, \"woke AI\u201d has replaced harmful algorithmic discrimination as a problem that needs fixing. Past efforts to \u201cadvance equity\u201d in AI development and curb the production of \u201charmful and biased outputs\u201d are a target of investigation, according to subpoenas sent to Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 10 other tech companies last month by the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "And the standard-setting branch of the U.S. Commerce Department has deleted mentions of AI fairness, safety and \u201cresponsible AI\u201d in its appeal for collaboration with outside researchers. It is instead instructing scientists to focus on \u201creducing ideological bias\u201d in a way that will \u201cenable human flourishing and economic competitiveness,\u201d according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "In some ways, tech workers are used to a whiplash of Washington-driven priorities affecting their work.",
      "But the latest shift has raised concerns among experts in the field, including Harvard University sociologist Ellis Monk, who several years ago was approached by Google to help make its AI products more inclusive.",
      "Back then, the tech industry already knew it had a problem with the branch of AI that trains machines to \u201csee\u201d and understand images. Computer vision held great commercial promise but echoed the historical biases found in earlier camera technologies that portrayed Black and brown people in an unflattering light.",
      "\u201cBlack people or darker skinned people would come in the picture and we\u2019d look ridiculous sometimes,\u201d said Monk, a scholar of colorism, a form of discrimination based on people\u2019s skin tones and other features.",
      "Google adopted a color scale invented by Monk that improved how its AI image tools portray the diversity of human skin tones, replacing a decades-old standard originally designed for doctors treating white dermatology patients.",
      "\u201cConsumers definitely had a huge positive response to the changes,\u201d he said.",
      "Now Monk wonders whether such efforts will continue in the future. While he doesn't believe that his Monk Skin Tone Scale is threatened because it's already baked into dozens of products at Google and elsewhere \u2014 including camera phones, video games, AI image generators \u2014 he and other researchers worry that the new mood is chilling future initiatives and funding to make technology work better for everyone.",
      "\u201cGoogle wants their products to work for everybody, in India, China, Africa, et cetera. That part is kind of DEI-immune,\" Monk said. \u201cBut could future funding for those kinds of projects be lowered? Absolutely, when the political mood shifts and when there\u2019s a lot of pressure to get to market very quickly.\u201d",
      "Trump has cut hundreds of science, technology and health funding grants touching on DEI themes, but its influence on commercial development of chatbots and other AI products is more indirect. In investigating AI companies, Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the judiciary committee, said he wants to find out whether former President Joe Biden's administration \u201ccoerced or colluded with\" them to censor lawful speech.",

      "The Trump administration declined to make Kratsios available for an interview but quoted several examples of what he meant. One was a line from a Biden-era AI research strategy that said: \u201cWithout proper controls, AI systems can amplify, perpetuate, or exacerbate inequitable or undesirable outcomes for individuals and communities.\u201d",
      "Even before Biden took office, a growing body of research and personal anecdotes was attracting attention to the harms of AI bias.",
      "One study showed self-driving car technology has a hard time detecting darker-skinned pedestrians, putting them in greater danger of getting run over. Another study asking popular AI text-to-image generators to make a picture of a surgeon found they produced a white man about 98% percent of the time, far higher than the real proportions even in a heavily male-dominated field.",
      "Face-matching software for unlocking phones misidentified Asian faces. Police in U.S. cities wrongfully arrested Black men based on false face recognition matches. And a decade ago, Google\u2019s own photos app sorted a picture of two Black people into a category labeled as \u201cgorillas.\u201d",
      "Even government scientists in the first Trump administration concluded in 2019 that facial recognition technology was performing unevenly based on race, gender or age.",
      "Biden's election propelled some tech companies to accelerate their focus on AI fairness. The 2022 arrival of OpenAI's ChatGPT added new priorities, sparking a commercial boom in new AI applications for composing documents and generating images, pressuring companies like Google to ease its caution and catch up.",
      "Then came Google's Gemini AI chatbot \u2014 and a flawed product rollout last year that would make it the symbol of \u201cwoke AI\u201d that conservatives hoped to unravel. Left to their own devices, AI tools that generate images from a written prompt are prone to perpetuating the stereotypes accumulated from all the visual data they were trained on.",
      "Google's was no different, and when asked to depict people in various professions, it was more likely to favor lighter-skinned faces and men, and, when women were chosen, younger women, according to the company's own public research.",
      "Google tried to place technical guardrails to reduce those disparities before rolling out Gemini's AI image generator just over a year ago. It ended up overcompensating for the bias, placing people of color and women in inaccurate historical settings, such as answering a request for American founding fathers with images of men in 18th century attire who appeared to be Black, Asian and Native American. Google quickly apologized and temporarily pulled the plug on the feature, but the outrage became a rallying cry taken up by the political right.",
      "With Google CEO Sundar Pichai sitting nearby, Vice President JD Vance used an AI summit in Paris in February to decry the advancement of \u201cdownright ahistorical social agendas through AI,\u201d naming the moment when Google\u2019s AI image generator was \u201ctrying to tell us that George Washington was Black, or that America\u2019s doughboys in World War I were, in fact, women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to remember the lessons from that ridiculous moment,\u201d Vance declared at the gathering. \"And what we take from it is that the Trump administration will ensure that AI systems developed in America are free from ideological bias and never restrict our citizens\u2019 right to free speech.\u201d",
      "A former Biden science adviser who attended that speech, Alondra Nelson, said the Trump administration's new focus on AI's \u201cideological bias\u201d is in some ways a recognition of years of work to address algorithmic bias that can affect housing, mortgages, health care and other aspects of people's lives.",
      "\u201cFundamentally, to say that AI systems are ideologically biased is to say that you identify, recognize and are concerned about the problem of algorithmic bias, which is the problem that many of us have been worried about for a long time,\u201d said Nelson, the former acting director of the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy who co-authored a set of principles to protect civil rights and civil liberties in AI applications.",
      "But Nelson doesn't see much room for collaboration amid the denigration of equitable AI initiatives.",
      "\u201cI think in this political space, unfortunately, that is quite unlikely,\u201d she said. \u201cProblems that have been differently named \u2014 algorithmic discrimination or algorithmic bias on the one hand, and ideological bias on the other \u2014- will be regrettably seen us as two different problems.\u201d",

      "People with diseases caused by rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than other patients despite rapid recent advancements in the growing field of genetic science",
      "Emily Kramer-Golinkoff can\u2019t get enough oxygen with each breath. Advanced cystic fibrosis makes even simple things like walking or showering arduous and exhausting.",
      "She has the most common fatal genetic disease in the U.S., which afflicts 40,000 Americans. But her case is caused by a rare genetic mutation, so medications that work for 90% of people with cystic fibrosis won\u2019t help her.",
      "The same dynamic plays out in other genetic conditions. Stunning advances in genetic science have revealed the subtle, insidious culprits behind these brutal diseases and have started paving the way for treatments. But patients with these exceedingly rare mutations have fewer options and poorer prospects than those with more typical forms of these diseases \u2014 and many are now pinning hopes on experimental gene therapies.",
      "\u201cWe feel such pure joy for our friends who have been lifted from this sinking ship,\u201d said Kramer-Golinkoff, 40. \u201cBut we just feel so eager and desperate to join them. It\u2019s really hard to be in this minority of people left behind.\u201d",
      "It's not just science that is working against these patients, it's market forces. Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations.",
      "\u201cYou need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is \"mutational discrimination.\u201d",
      "Charities \u2013 including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily\u2019s Entourage \u2013 are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.",
      "While it likely won't be available for years, \u201cjust to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body.",
      "It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older \u2026 my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master\u2019s degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She\u2019s prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCF is a real monster of a disease,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with \u201cCFTR modulator\u201d therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients\u2019 overall quality of life.",
      "Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.",
      "Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.",
      "For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations \u2013 affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don\u2019t benefit from modulator therapies.",
      "While there\u2019s little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop \u201cmutation agnostic\u201d gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge push to develop these therapies,\" said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center.",
      "Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.",
      "One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily\u2019s Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.",

      "\u201cYou have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that\u2019s really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,\u201d she said.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A lawsuit against Florida's ban on \u201clab-grown\u201d meat is still alive after a federal judge tossed four parts of the suit on Friday but kept a fifth.",
      "Northern District of Florida Chief Judge Mark Walker declined to dismiss a part of the lawsuit that argued Florida's restrictions give an unconstitutional advantage to Florida farmers over out-of-state competitors. Meanwhile, the judge sided with state attorneys seeking to dismiss the lawsuit and their argument that federal approval of cultivated chicken doesn't mean individual states can't ban it.",
      "U.S. regulators first signed off on the sale of what\u2019s known as \u201ccell-cultured\u201d or \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d meat in June 2023. The lawsuit had argued that Florida\u2019s law is preempted under federal laws that regulate the interstate market for meat and poultry products. Sellers say the product is a more ethical and sustainable alternative to conventionally raised chicken, beef and pork.",
      "But lawmakers in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi have called cultivated meat a threat to their states\u2019 agriculture industries and banned the sale of the product, which is made of animal cells that are fed a mix of proteins, vitamins and water and then formed into nuggets, sausages and steaks.",
      "The lawsuit was filed last year by Upside Foods, represented by the nonprofit law firm the Institute for Justice.",
      "\u201cUpside is not looking to replace conventional meat, which will always have a place at the table,\u201d Upside CEO Uma Valeti said in a statement. \"All we are asking for is the right to compete, so that Floridians can try our product and see that it is possible to have delicious meat without the need for slaughtering animals. Today\u2019s ruling is an important step toward securing that right.\u201d",
      "The governor's office and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment about the lawsuit.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis was flanked by cattle farmers last May when he signed the state\u2019s cultivated meat ban into law.",
      "\u201cWe stand with agriculture, we stand with the cattle ranchers, we stand with our farmers because we understand it\u2019s important for the backbone of the state,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cTake your fake lab-grown meat elsewhere.\u201d",

      "X, the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- X Corp., the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates, saying it violates First Amendment speech protections.",
      "The company's federal lawsuit filed this week also contends that the 2023 state law is preempted by a 1996 federal statute that shields social media from being held responsible for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cWhile the law's reference to banning \u2018deep fakes\u2019 might sound benign, in reality it would criminalize innocuous, election-related speech, including humor, and make social-media platforms criminally liable for censoring such speech,\" the company said in a statement. \u201cInstead of defending democracy, this law would erode it.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's law imposes criminal penalties \u2014 including jail time \u2014 for disseminating a deepfake video, image or audio if a person knows it's fake, or acts with reckless disregard to its authenticity, either within 90 days before a party nominating convention, or after the start of early voting in a primary or general election.",
      "It says the intent must be to injure a candidate or influence an election result. And it defines deepfakes as material so realistic that a reasonable person would believe it's real, and generated by artificial intelligence or other technical means.",
      "\u201cElon Musk funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the 2024 presidential election and tried to buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat,\" said the law's author, Democratic state Sen. Erin Maye Quade.",
      "\"Of course he is upset that Minnesota law prevents him from spreading deepfakes that meant to harm candidates and influence elections. Minnesota\u2019s law is clear and precise, while this lawsuit is petty, misguided and a waste of the Attorney General Office\u2019s time and resources,\u201d her statement said.",
      "Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is legally obligated to defend the constitutionality of state laws in court, said in a statement that it's \u201creviewing the lawsuit and will respond in the appropriate time and manner.\u201d",
      "The Minnesota law was already the subject of a constitutional challenge by Christopher Kohls, a content creator, and GOP state Rep. Mary Franson, who likes to post AI-generated parodies of politicians. That case is on hold while they appeal to overturn a judge's denial of their request to suspend the law.",
      "The attorney general's office argues in that case that deepfakes are a real and growing threat to free elections and democratic institutions, that the law is a legitimate and constitutional response to the problem, and that it contains important limitations on its scope that protect satire and parody.",
      "X, formerly known as Twitter, said it's the only social media platform challenging the Minnesota law, and that it has also challenged other laws it considers infringements of free speech, such as a 2024 California political deepfakes law that a judge has blocked.",
      "X said in its statement that its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d feature allows users to flag content they consider problematic, and that it's been adopted by Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. The company's lawsuit said its \u201cAuthenticity Policy\u201d and \u201cGrok AI\u201d tool provide additional safeguards.",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on technology law, said in an interview Friday that it's important to separate the free-speech issues from whatever one thinks about the controversial Musk.",
      "\u201cI'm almost positive that this will be struck down,\u201d Rozenshtein said.",
      "There's no exception under the First Amendment for false or misleading political speech, even lies, he said. And the potential for criminal penalties gives social media companies like X and Facebook \u201can incentive to take down anything that might be a deepfake. ... You're going to censor a massive amount to comply with this law.\u201d",
      "Deepfakes aren't good, but it would be nice to get evidence that they're causing actual problems before imposing such limits on free speech, the professor said. And while it's easy to focus on the supply of misinformation, the large demand for it is the problem.",
      "\u201cPeople want to be fooled, and it's very bad for our democracy, but it\u2019s not something I think can be solved with a deepfakes ban,\" he said.",

      "Alphabet's stock gained 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. The shares had fallen by 16% since the end of last year.",
      "Google\u2019s first-quarter performance illustrated the continuing power of its long-dominant search engine in a sea of uncertainty.

      "Google's long-dominant search engine is countering the new competition with a feature called AI Overviews that appear above web links in its results. It is also testing a conversational tool called AI Mode that would usher in an even more radical change to its business model.",
      "\u201cThe company delivered a sound response to those questioning the solidity of the search business amid ever-increasing AI demand,\u201d Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said.",
      "But Google is trying to keep its business intact as by the U.S. Justice Department attempts to break up the company and impose other restraints after a federal judge last year branded its search engine an illegal monopoly. To make matters worse, its digital ad network also was found to be illegally abusing its power earlier this month in another case brought by the Justice Department.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has injected more uncertainty into the mix by rattling the financial markets amid fears the tariffs will reignite inflation while dragging the economy into a recession. Although Google\u2019s digital services aren\u2019t directly impacted by the tariffs, a recession would likely curtail the spending on ads that generate most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue.",
      "But there were few signs of a slowdown in the past quarter. Google's ad revenue during the period totaled $72.5 billion, an 11% increase from the same time a year ago.",
      "The steady growth emboldened Alphabet to stand firm on plans to invest $75 billion on AI and other technologies this year while also pursuing approval of a $32 billion deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz.",

      "The Tiangong, or \u201cHeavenly Palace,\u201d space station has made China a major contender in space, especially since it was entirely Chinese-built after the country was excluded from the International Space Station over U.S. national security concerns.

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has ordered sharper scrutiny of America\u2019s colleges and the accreditors that oversee them, part of his escalating campaign to end what he calls \" wokeness \u201d and diversity efforts in education.",
      "In a series of executive actions signed Wednesday, Trump targeted universities that he views as liberal adversaries to his political agenda. One order called for harder enforcement of a federal law requiring colleges to disclose their financial ties with foreign sources, while another called for a shakeup of the accrediting bodies that decide whether colleges can accept federal financial aid awarded to students.",
      "Trump also ordered the Education Department to root out efforts to ensure equity in discipline in the nation's K-12 schools. Previous guidance from Democratic administrations directed schools not to disproportionately punish underrepresented minorities such as Black and Native American students. The administration says equity efforts amount to racial discrimination.",
      "Colleges\u2019 financial ties with foreign sources have long been a concern among Republicans, especially ties with China and other countries with adversarial relationships with the U.S. It became a priority during Trump\u2019s first term and reemerged last week as the White House grasped for leverage in its escalating battle with Harvard University.",
      "The White House said it needed to take action because Harvard and other colleges have routinely violated a federal disclosure law, which has been unevenly enforced since it was passed in the 1980s. Known as Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the law requires colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more.",
      "Last week, the Education Department demanded records from Harvard over foreign financial ties spanning the past decade, accusing the school of filing \u201cincomplete and inaccurate disclosures.\u201d Trump's administration is sparring with Harvard over the university's refusal to accept a list of demands over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests as well as its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "In the executive order, Trump calls on the Education Department and the attorney general to step up enforcement of the law and take action against colleges that violate it, including a cutoff of federal money.",
      "The Trump administration intends to \u201cend the secrecy surrounding foreign funds in American educational institutions\u201d and protect against \u201cforeign exploitation,\u201d the order said.",
      "It was applauded by Republicans, including Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. He accused China of exploiting academic ties to steal research and \u201cindoctrinate students.\u201d",
      "Another order aims at accrediting bodies that set standards colleges must meet to accept federal financial aid from students. Trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul the industry, saying it was \u201cdominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.\u201d",
      "Often overlooked as an obscure branch of college oversight, accreditors play an important role in shaping colleges in many aspects, with standards that apply all the way from colleges\u2019 governing boards to classroom curriculum.",
      "Trump's executive order is the opening salvo in what could be a lengthy battle to overhaul the accrediting industry. Chief among his priorities is to strip accreditors of DEI requirements imposed on colleges. Some accreditors have already dropped or stopped enforcing such standards amid Trump\u2019s DEI crackdown.",
      "Trump\u2019s order calls on the government to suspend or terminate accreditors that discriminate in the name of DEI. Instead, it calls on accreditors to focus more squarely on the student outcomes of colleges and programs they oversee.",
      "The president wants to make it easier for new accreditors to compete with the 19 that are now authorized to work on behalf of the federal government. As it stands, new accreditors looking to be recognized by the government must undergo an arduous process that traditionally takes years. Trump\u2019s order said it should be \u201ctransparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of pushing schools to adopt a divisive DEI ideology, accreditors should be focused on helping schools improve graduation rates and graduates\u2019 performance in the labor market,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.",
      "Trump also invoked opposition to equity efforts in his order on school discipline. The edict signed Wednesday seeks a return to \u201ccommon sense school discipline,\u201d allowing decisions to be based solely on students\u2019 behavior and actions, McMahon said.",
      "Another executive order instructs government agencies and departments to no longer rely on \u201cdisparate impact theories.\u201d Under the disparate impact standard, policies and practices that disproportionately impact minorities and other protected groups could be challenged regardless of their intent.",
      "In many schools around the country, Black students have been more likely to receive punishments that remove them from the classroom, including suspensions, expulsions and being transferred to alternative schools. A decade ago, those differences became the target of a reform movement spurred by the same reckoning that gave rise to Black Lives Matter. The movement elevated the concept of the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d \u2014 the notion that being kicked out of school, or dropping out, increases the chance of arrest and imprisonment years later.",
      "Federal guidelines to address racial disparities in school discipline first came from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2014. Federal officials urged schools not to suspend, expel or refer students to law enforcement except as a last resort, and encouraged restorative justice practices that did not push students out of the classroom. Those rules were rolled back by Trump\u2019s first administration, but civil rights regulations at federal and state levels still mandate the collection of data on discipline.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump directed McMahon to issue new school discipline guidance within 60 days. The order also calls for a review of nonprofit organizations that have promoted discipline policies rooted in equity and ensure they don\u2019t receive federal money.",
      "Another order creates a federal task force focused on giving America\u2019s students training on artificial intelligence as early as kindergarten. It would work to develop new online learning resources.",
      "Trump is also establishing a White House initiative to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Among other efforts, it would seek to promote private-sector partnerships with HBCUs and schools\u2019 workforce preparation in industries like technology and finance.",

      "Here are more headlines from ABC News' exclusive sit-down with Trump.",
      "Asked by ABC News' Moran for a message to voters who may feel some anxiety at the prospect of higher costs from tariffs, Trump claimed that he has delivered on his signature campaign pledge to lower prices on his first day in the White House.",
      "\"There is a lot of concern out there,\" Moran said. \"People are worried, even some people who voted for you sayin', 'I didn't sign up for this.' So how do you answer those concerns?\"",
      "\"Well, they did sign up for it, actually. And this is what I campaigned on,\" Trump replied. \"I said that we've been abused by other countries at levels that nobody's ever seen before \u2026 I could've left it that way, and at some point, there would've been an implosion like nobody's ever seen. But I said, 'No, we have to fix it.' I've -- I've wanted to do this for many years.\"",
      "Trump claimed credit for what he said were lower prices for gasoline and groceries, pointing specifically to eggs, which emerged as a major issue during the 2024 campaign.",
      "\"They hit me the first week, 'Eggs, eggs, eggs,' like it was my fault. I said, 'I didn't cause this problem. This problem was caused by Biden. What's the problem with eggs?' And they said, 'They've doubled it.' Well, eggs are down 87% since I got involved,\" Trump said. \"And by the way -- and there were plenty of eggs for Easter, which we just went through.\"",
      "Trump promoted his administration's immigration policies and responded to concerns about the wrongful deportation of some people living in America, maintaining that they are \"careful\" in their efforts.",
      "\"Well, they seem to work,\" Trump said of his methods to cut down on illegal crossings along the southern border.",
      "Moran questioned Trump about whether he agrees that even \"really bad guys\" deserve due process.",
      "\"Well, they get a process where we have to get 'em out, yeah,\" Trump replied, adding later that, \"If people come into our country illegally there's a different standard. These are illegal. They came in illegally.\"",
      "When Moran later asked about podcaster and Trump supporter Joe Rogan's comments that those being deported must be afforded due process because \"we gotta be careful that we don't become monsters while we're fighting monsters,\" the president said he agreed.",
      "\"Oh, I agree with that a hundred percent, yeah. We want to be careful,\" Trump said. \"We are careful. We're doing something that has to be done. We have a country that's very sick.\"",
      "Trump framed his unprecedented use of official powers to push through his policy agenda as a necessary step in healing a \"sick\" country.",
      "\"What do you say to people who are concerned you are taking, seizing too much power and becoming an authoritarian president like we haven't had before?\" Moran asked.",
      "\"No, I would hate them to think that,\" Trump said. \"I'm doing one thing: I'm makin' America great again. We have a country that was failing. We have a country that was laughed at all over the world. We had a leader that was grossly incompetent. He should have never been there.\"",
      "In a social media post on Saturday, Trump asserted that \"there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,\" adding that \"it makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through \"Banking\" or \"Secondary Sanctions?\" Too many people are dying!!!\"",
      "\"It's possible,\" Trump told Moran of Putin \"tapping\" him along. \"Yeah, that's possible. Sure. He could be tapping me along a little bit. I would say that he would like to stop the war. I think that--\"",
      "\"You believe that?\" Moran jumped in.",
      "\"If -- if it weren't for me, I think he'd want to take over the whole country, personally,\" Trump continued. \"I always felt -- so when I left, there wasn't even a chance that this would happen. When Biden got involved, I won't say whether or not he handled it properly, but obviously it wasn't good, because the war started.\"",
      "The president went on to say, \"I think Putin wanted all of Ukraine,\" and claimed Putin invaded Ukraine because Biden was in office. \"I think if I didn't win the election, he would have gotten all of Ukraine.\"",
      "He later added that, \"And because of me, I do believe that -- he's willing to stop the fighting.\"",
      "Trump, in discussing his administration's Department of Government Efficiency, the effort spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk to rid the federal government of what they call waste and fraud, said referrals have been made to the Department of Justice for prosecution on fraud charges.",
      "Moran asked if DOGE, which has cut foreign food programs and medical research, among other items, had gone \"too far, too fast, too recklessly.\"",
      "Trump said, \"no,\" saying DOGE had saved the country billions.",
      "\"We also found tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse, as you know. We found a lot of fraud. There was a lot of fraud,\" Trump said. \"Fraudulent things were taking place, and we ended that, and those people are gonna be suffering--\"",
      "Asked several times on whether any fraud referrals were made to the Justice Department, Trump said, \"Have there been? Yes, there have.\"",
      "\"So, there have been referrals for fraud from the work of DOGE?\" Moran asked Trump.",
      "Trump replied, \"Of course there have been.\"",
      "Throughout the interview, Trump repeatedly accused former President Joe Biden of incompetence and blamed his predecessor for myriad challenges facing his administration. Moran also asked Trump about his decision to strip his political opponents' security details and about appearing to target some law firms.",
      "\"Are you using your powers as president to get personal revenge?\" Moran asked Trump.",
      "\"No. I'll tell you what -- I tell you what you sh -- not -- you're really not asking and you should be asking. There has never been a president in this country in the history that was persecuted like I was persecuted by really crooked people,\" Trump maintained. \"Dishonest, horrible people. And it's been proven.\"",
      "Moran later asked Trump again if \"that gives you the right to go after your political opponents with the powers of this office?\"",
      "\"I don't go after -- I don't go -- I'm going after -- all I'm doing -- hey, Biden did something to me -- and I did something to Biden. And you know why I did it? 'Cause he's grossly incompetent,\" Trump said. \"That's not a man that should be allowed to, you know, be lookin' at things that are very confidential.\"",
      "A day after Canadians voted to elect a fourth straight Liberal government and keep Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has been fiercely critical of Trump's tariffs and annexation threats, Trump downplayed souring relations with America's northern neighbor.",
      "\"You were a big issue in it,\" Moran told Trump of the election. \"And Canadians, many of them, are really angry, furious, about your talk about, 'We're gonna take over Canada. It's gonna become the 51st state--'\"",
      "\"That's their prerogative,\" Trump said.",
      "When Moran pointed to a decrease in travel from Canada to the U.S., Trump said, \"We're doing great.\"",
      "\"Feels like there's been reputational damage,\" Moran told the president.",
      "\"The country's doing great,\" Trump maintained.",
      "Moran later asked Trump if he thought \"the reputation of the United States has gone down under your presidency?\"",
      "\"I -- no, I think it's gone way up, and I think we're a respected country again,\" the president said. \"We were laughed at all over the world.\"",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has enacted a sweeping number of policies that could harm the environment and hamper goals for greenhouse gas reductions, some experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Trump entered his second term with a slew of plans that impact the environment.",
      "President Donald Trump has enacted a sweeping number of policies that could harm the environment and hamper goals for greenhouse gas reductions during his first 100 days in office, according to environmental policy experts.",
      "When Trump was inaugurated for his second term on Jan. 20, his administration came prepared -- shattering the record for the most executive orders signed on the first day in office.",
      "Several of the 54 executive orders signed on Inauguration Day impacted the environment, including a declaration of a national energy emergency, withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement for the second time and rolling back drilling restrictions on federal lands and waters.",
      "The policies are largely shrouded in the idea of U.S. independence or \"putting America first,\" the orders state.",
      "The Trump administration has engaged in a \"flood the zone\" strategy to overwhelm the environmental community and make it nearly impossible for them to respond to every single executive order, Dan Esty, a professor of environmental law and policy at Yale University and former commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, told ABC News.",
      "While some of the Trump administration's \"anti-environment\" policies, as Esty called them, are garnering more attention than others, he added the public shouldn't ignore the seemingly minor rollbacks or actions.",
      "\"There are a number of more subtle actions that the Trump administration has taken that also have considerable corrosive effect on our efforts to promote action on climate change and a sustainable future more broadly,\" he said.",
      "One example experts cited is the rollback of the social cost of carbon regulation, a policy implemented during the Obama administration, Esty said. This decision could upend energy and environmental regulations designed to address the greenhouse gas emissions that heavily contribute to climate change, he explained.",
      "\"The takedown of the social cost of carbon has subtle but pervasive effects that will really damage environmental protection,\" Esty said.",
      "Another example is Trump's executive order to protect \"American energy from state overreach,\" which contains language that could block enforcement of state and local laws that intervene in the production or use of coal, oil, natural gas, hydropower, geothermal, biofuel and nuclear energy. The order centralizes energy regulation at the federal level and targets policies that restrict carbon emissions, which could further derail decarbonization efforts and roll back clean air and water protections, experts say.",
      "On Monday, the Trump administration dismissed the authors of the Sixth National Climate Assessment report -- the U.S. government's preeminent report on the risks, impacts and responses to climate change mandated by Congress and produced every four years. In an email to the authors, the administration wrote that \"the scope of the NCA6 is currently being reevaluated\" and officials are \"releasing all current assessment participants from their roles.\"",
      "The \"Climate Backtracker,\" a database started by Columbia University's Sabin Center for Climate Change that tracks steps taken by the Trump administration to scale back or eliminate federal climate mitigation and adaptation measures, lists more than 100 actions taken since Jan. 20.",
      "It will be difficult to reverse the damage done by many of these policies, John Holdren, a professor of environmental science and policy and former science adviser to President Barack Obama, told ABC News.",
      "\"You cannot reassemble broken programs very quickly,\" he said.",
      "These are some of Trump's policies that some experts say could cause the most environmental harm.",
      "Trump's declaration of a national energy emergency lays the framework for enacting policies that increase domestic production of fossil fuels, experts said.",
      "\"We need a reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation\u2019s manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness,\" according to an executive order he signed.",
      "Apart from rolling back restrictions on drilling, Trump also signed an executive order to expand mining and the use of coal in the U.S.",
      "On April 18, the Department of the Interior announced a new offshore leasing plan on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.",
      "Sam Sankar, senior vice president at Earthjustice, the nation's largest public interest environmental law firm, told ABC News that U.S. fossil fuel production is at an all-time high, despite Trump's claims of an energy crisis.",
      "In 2024, the country produced 13.2 million barrels of oil per day, breaking the record set in 2019 at 12.3 million barrels, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. For the last several years, the U.S. has been the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the world.",
      "Several of the environmental freedoms Americans experience today \u2013 clean air, clean water and clean rain among them \u2013 could soon be in jeopardy from the Environmental Protection Agency's deregulation plans, according to experts.",
      "On March 12, the EPA announced it was taking part in the \"biggest deregulatory action in U.S. history.\" The move includes rolling back emission regulations on coal, oil and gas production and reevaluating government findings that determined that greenhouse gas emissions heat the planet and are a threat to public health, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said.",
      "\"Alongside President Trump, we are living up to our promises to unleash American energy, lower costs for Americans, revitalize the American auto industry, and work hand-in-hand with our state partners to advance our shared mission,\" Zeldin said in March.",
      "In November, when Trump announced his intention to nominate Zeldin, he said the new EPA administrator would \"ensure fair and swift deregulatory decisions that will be enacted in a way to unleash the power of American businesses\" in a post on his social media platform Truth Social.",
      "Revoking these regulations would hamper the EPA's ability to keep Americans from getting sick from the exposure to environmental pollutants, experts said.",
      "\"Any policy changes that may occur under this administration will continue to protect human health and the environment,\" an EPA spokesperson said in response to an ABC News request for comment. \"They will be guided by science and the law, as well as input from the public. They will also be guided by many of the executive orders issued by the President and EPA Administrator Zeldin\u2019s Powering the Great American Comeback Initiative.\u201d",
      "The health of Americans, however, could suffer as a result of sweeping regulation at the EPA, Sankar said.",
      "\"All of the regulations [Trump] is rolling back are aimed at making it easier for the fossil fuel manufacturers to generate petrochemicals and and fuel supplies,\" he said. \"All of that stuff has tremendous health consequences.\"",
      "After taking office, Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), overseen by billionaire Elon Musk and intended to incorporate cost-cutting within the federal government.",
      "Since then, DOGE has eliminated thousands of federal employees at key scientific institutions, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA.",
      "The White House says Trump created DOGE \"to bring accountability and transparency to federal spending, ensuring taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and effectively.\"",
      "The NWS has cancelled certain weather balloon launches and is dealing with staffing issues at many of its local offices as a result of the cuts, the agency announced in March.",
      "The administration has been \"slashing staff, slashing budgets, slashing programs across the range of federal departments and agencies with responsibilities for supporting this enormous science and technology enterprise,\" Holdren said.",
      "While the \"assault\" on environmental policy, as Esty termed it, was anticipated going into Trump's second term, the sweeping personnel cuts were not.",
      "\"When people of expertise and competence leave the government, you cannot find them and rehire them and reassemble them into teams very quickly,\" Holdren said.",
      "Esty added, \"It has long been understood that good policy depends on careful analysis and good science, and we're seeing the capacity to deliver that foundation systematically undermined.\"",
      "Meanwhile, mentions of climate change began disappearing from public websites after Inauguration Day.",
      "\"This can hardly be seen as anything short of a wholesale attack on the sources of scientific and technological innovation in this country,\" Holdren said.",

      "\"This remarkable story has brightly captured imaginations, it has now inspired books and movies, stirred the consciousness of millions of Americans, who are just now hearing and sharing this incredible story,\" Johnson said.",
      "Earley's children, Stanley Earley III and Judith Earley, received the award from the House and Senate leaders.",
      "During their service in 1945, the 855-member battalion did not gain any fanfare or recognition for their feats. This medal comes after years of campaigning for the overlooked battalion that many say set an example for Black women in the military.",
      "Congress voted 422-0 to award the 6888th with this honor back in 2022. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wisc.), who co-sponsored the legislation, spoke at the ceremony, praising the \"unsung heroes\" receiving the acknowledgement 80 years later.",
      "This honor marks the latest development in the unit's overdue recognition. A monument was erected in 2018 at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in their honor, and the 6888th was given the Meritorious Unit Commendation by the U.S. Army in 2019.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, under investigation for mishandling sensitive military information, traveled to Michigan on Tuesday alongside President Donald Trump in what appeared to be a show of support for the Pentagon chief whose rocky tenure has prompted calls by Democrats for his resignation.",
      "Speaking at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Trump introduced his secretary of defense to the Guard members, telling them Hegseth was doing \"a really great job.\"",
      "In brief remarks following Trump, Hegseth praised the president.",
      "\u201cOnly because the commander in chief invited me,\u201d Hegseth said, gesturing to Trump. \u201cMr. President, thank you for restoring the warrior ethos inside our formations, for rebuilding our military, reestablishing deterrence around the world and making Americans proud to wear the uniform.\u201d",
      "Hegseth later added: \u201cAll I ever wanted when I was in combat was to know that my commander had my back no matter what, and with Donald J Trump, that commander has your back.\u201d",
      "Hegseth\u2019s office declined to answer questions about why he was added to Trump\u2019s entourage as part of the president\u2019s trip to celebrate his 100 days in office. Hegseth\u2019s involvement was not previously announced.",
      "Trump was to speak later to a rally crowd in Warren, Michigan, to tout his achievements during his first 100 days. He was joined at the base by Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as he announced that Selfridge would receive 21 F-15 fighters which will bolster its future.",
      "An infantry officer in the U.S. Army National Guard, Hegseth deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan before leaving the service with the rank of major, according to military records.",
      "\u201cFrom Day One, our overriding objectives have been clear: restoring the warrior ethos, rebuilding our military, and reestablishing deterrence,\u201d said Sean Parnell, a senior adviser to Hegseth. \u201cIn 100 days, the Department of Defense and our warfighters have delivered historic victories for the American people.\u201d",
      "Hegseth, a former Fox News anchor, was narrowly confirmed by the Senate earlier this year following allegations of financial mismanagement at a veterans nonprofit, sexual assault and heavy drinking -- all allegations he denies and says were aimed at smearing his reputation.",
      "Two months after Hegseth took the helm at the Pentagon, The Atlantic reported he was using the commercial messaging app Signal to update other national security officials, including Vice President JD Vance, with detailed plans for a military attack on the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Hegseth then used a second Signal chat to provide sensitive details to his wife, brother and personal lawyer, ABC News confirmed.",
      "The Pentagon's independent watchdog, DOD acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins, said he would investigate the use of Signal by Hegseth and others.",
      "Trump later told The Atlantic that he spoke with Hegseth following the reports.",
      "\"I think he's gonna get it together,\" Trump said of Hegseth. \"I had a talk with him, a positive talk, but I had a talk with him.\"",
      "Adding to the tumult is the departure of several top aides to the secretary. Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper, recently stepped down, moving into a part-time advisory role. Hegseth fired three other close aides for what he said was leaking, although the aides say they have not been approached by investigators and remain unclear what the allegations are. And a fifth adviser resigned, writing a scathing opinion article calling Hegseth's handling of the Pentagon \"total chaos.\"",
      "For his part, Hegseth said he's fighting to enact the president's agenda. On Tuesday, shortly before leaving on his trip with the president, Hegseth said he \u201cproudly\" ended a small Defense Department program aimed at bolstering the participation of women in helping to resolve overseas conflicts, calling the effort a \u201cwoke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative.\u201d",
      "The program -- called \u201cWomen, Peace and Security\u201d -- was signed into law by Trump during his first term in 2017 after several Republicans, including current Trump Cabinet members Kristi Noem and Marco Rubio, who were lawmakers at the time, sponsored the bill.",

      "His targets have included law firms, individual critics and more.",
      "President Donald Trump, upon his return to the White House, appears to have quickly turned one of his more ominous campaign promises into reality.",
      "Among his first acts after being sworn in inside the Capitol Rotunda was to strip the security clearances from 51 former intelligence officials who signed a letter during the 2024 campaign describing a news story abut the public release of emails from Hunter Biden's laptop as potentially part of a Russian disinformation operation.",
      "In the days that followed, he removed protective details for former officials who received threats over their work, including retired Gen. Mark Milley, Dr. Anthony Fauci, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others. Trump's reasoning at the time was, \"You can't have a security detail for the rest of your life.\"",
      "Trump told supporters at his first 2024 rally, back in March 2023: \"I am your retribution.\"",
      "Now, 100 days into his second term, his list of targets appears to be growing. And much of the action is aligned with his own political interests.",
      "\"He's really taking it to the next level,\" said Nick Akerman, a former federal prosecutor who helped investigate President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal.",
      "Some predictable Trump targets have included former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, whose access to classified information he revoked. (While it is the norm for former presidents to receive briefings, the move against Biden came after Biden stripped Trump of having access to them in 2021, citing his \"erratic behavior.\")",
      "Trump's list of his critics who he said should no longer have access to classified material also included Hillary Clinton, his 2016 opponent; former Republican Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who investigated his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol attack; New York Attorney General Letitia James, who prosecuted his company for fraud; and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who led the hush money case against Trump that resulted in the first-ever criminal conviction of a former president.",
      "Trump also signed executive orders against some of the nation's top law firms.",
      "Perkins Coie, which represented Clinton's 2016 campaign, was the subject of an order mandating its lawyers have their security clearances stripped. The executive action also sought to terminate any government contracts that might exist with the firm or other entities that it represents, bar agencies from hiring employees of Perkins Coie and prohibit the firm's staff from accessing government buildings.",
      "Trump also took aim at WilmerHale, which has ties to former special counsel Robert Mueller, with an order alleging it engages in \"conduct detrimental to critical American interests\" in its pro-bono work. Trump ordered his administration to suspend the security clearances of WilmerHale employees and also requires government contractors to disclose any business they do with the law firm.",
      "Richard Painter, who served as a White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, criticized Trump's attacks on law firms as an affront to the rule of law.",
      "\"The executive orders against law firms are a fundamental infringement on the right to counsel and the right of lawyers to represent clients of their choice without retribution by the government,\" Painter said.",
      "\"The First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances includes the right to legal representation in court for anybody, even Democrats,\" Painter added.",
      "Several universities have found themselves in Trump's crosshairs as his administration made demands regarding campus policies and governance. Harvard University, after refusing, had $2.2 billion in federal grants frozen.",
      "News media, too, hasn't been spared.",
      "The Associated Press was barred from White House events because the outlet wouldn't refer to the Gulf of Mexico only as the \"Gulf of America,\" after Trump's order renaming the body of water, though the outlet appeared to gain back some access as the White House instituted a new policy lumping wire service reporters into a broader collective of print outlets. The White House has also suggested funding for NPR and PBS, which Trump accused of being left-leaning, is a waste of taxpayer money.",
      "Trump signed orders directing the Department of Justice to investigate two individuals who worked in his first administration who became outspoken critics of his leadership.",
      "Chris Krebs, resigned from his job at a private cybersecurity firm after Trump directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to review Krebs' actions while leading the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) -- a job Trump appointed him to in 2017. Krebs has long assured the 2020 election was secure, criticizing Trump for spreading debunked claims of election fraud.",
      "\"For those who know me, you know I don't shy away from tough fights. But I also know this is one I need to take on fully -- outside of SentinelOne,\" Krebs said in a social media post announcing his resignation. \"This will require my complete focus and energy. It's a fight for democracy, for freedom of speech, and for the rule of law. I'm prepared to give it everything I've got.\"",
      "Miles Taylor, the deputy chief of staff to former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, was also the target of an order from Trump directing the Justice Department to launch an investigation as Trump alleged he may have committed \"treason.\"",
      "Taylor penned a 2018 New York Times op-ed describing Trump as \"detrimental to the health of our republic\" and a 2019 book about the first administration under the pseudonym \"Anonymous\" before going public in 2020.",
      "Trump's targeting of various individuals and institutions come after he, for years, accused President Joe Biden of weaponizing law enforcement.",
      "\"Those days are over and they are never going to come back. They're never coming back. Now, as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred,\" Trump said as he spoke at the Justice Department in March.",
      "Republicans have praised some of Trump's moves, namely against universities and some news outlets.",
      "\"The vast majority of the American people do not want to prop up these institutions,\" Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik said when the Trump administration made demands of Harvard and other schools. Stefanik added, \"Higher education has fundamentally lost its way, and it's increasingly out of touch, and the tuition rates go higher and higher. So we need to defund across the board, and President Trump is rightly holding these schools accountable.\u201d",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, while criticizing NPR and PBS, said, \"The American people support the free press, but will not be forced to fund a biased political outlet with taxpayer funds.\"",
      "But critics said it's Trump who is wielding the powers of the presidency to go after political opponents in sweeping fashion.",

      "As President Donald Trump nears the 100th day of his second presidency, polling shows Americans largely disapproving of his handling of the economy, tariffs, and recent stock market turmoil.",
      "But his 2024 voters largely say they're still confident in his handling of the economy, and they overwhelmingly stand by their vote for Trump.",
      "\"I believe Trump will turn things around; I'm glad he's president,\" said Jessianna Bartier, 53, of Ohio. \"With Biden, I felt there was so much waste. He was causing a lot of damage economically,\" she said, and she had felt depressed by the former president's efforts. \"Trump has definitely got his work cut out for him.\"",
      "According to a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, only 39% of Americans approve of how Trump has handled the economy; fewer approve of his handling of tariffs on imported goods or recent stock market turmoil. Seventy-one percent of Americans said that Trump's handling of tariffs will contribute to inflation in the United States, although 59% think tariffs will create more manufacturing jobs.",
      "But among Americans who voted for Trump in 2024, 87% approve of how he is handling the economy, while 78% approve of his handling of tariffs. A softer 71% said they approve of his handling of recent turmoil in the stock market.",
      "Furthermore, among 2024 Trump voters, 74% think his economic policies will put the U.S. economy on a stronger foundation for the long term; at the same time, 45% of those voters think it's very or somewhat likely that his economic policies will cause a recession in the short term.",
      "An overwhelming 96% of those who voted for Trump believe how they voted was the right thing to do.",
      "Bartier, a former flight attendant, now works as a bartender and lives in Ohio. She said she used to be a Democrat but became Republican as she \"started dating more mature men.\" She said she has always voted because \"my voice matters.\"",
      "Bartier said her family is struggling financially at the moment, because her fiance lost his job and her own income is \"definitely not enough.\"",
      "But she's optimistic that Trump will be able to strengthen the economy.",
      "She has mixed feelings about Trump on some issues, saying she appreciates his border crackdown but is at odds with his views on LGBTQ issues and abortion.",
      "But on tariffs, she said she feels they may cause challenges at first but will be effective later on -- although the recent stock market turmoil does give her pause.",
      "\"I think the tariffs are, in the short term, going to hurt us economically; but in the long term, [they're] going to bring back jobs to America,\" she said. She acknowledged feeling uncertain about how the tariff news impacted stocks: \"Do I like seeing the Dow go down on itself? No.\"",
      "\"[Trump's] gonna do what he's gonna do. He's kind of a rogue agent,\" Bartier added.",
      "Anthony Romano, 64, a retired purchasing agent who lives by himself in Philadelphia, said he feels positive about Trump but has some concerns about the stock market.",
      "\"Overall I think he's doing a really good job,\" Romano said, but he added that it \"seems like the stock market has been crashing -- it'll put a lot of stress on people.\"",
      "Stocks have fluctuated in the wake of what some experts described as continued uncertainty over the White House's tariff policies and announcements. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday that the White House is \"setting the fundamentals for a strong dollar, a strong economy, a strong stock market\".",
      "Romano said he's still confident in the president, citing Trump's experience as a businessman.",
      "\"I have my trust in him; he knows what he's doing,\" he said.",
      "Another of Trump's voters who took the poll, Deborah Williams, 71, of Nevada, considers herself an independent politically and said she just retired from running a home-based business. Her husband, 78, has a part-time job and earns minimum wage.",
      "She said she's keeping an eye on the economy, especially given their dwindled income, and is \"cautious about where I'm spending my money these days,\" including with travel.",
      "On tariffs, she has mixed feelings. She's concerned they could impact prices and may be being done too bluntly, but called Trump's philosophy behind them \"a noble idea.\"",
      "\"I want America to be the tough kid on the block again,\" Williams said, and she does not want think Americans should be paying for or subsidizing other countries' expenses. \"Trump's my man for doing that at this point,\" she said, adding later, \"He has the opportunity to put our economy back together by playing hardnose with some of these people we import from.\"",
      "The poll only asks respondents for their first names; some respondents contacted by ABC News declined to share their last name.",
      "Irene, 63, who works for the library and local government in a northern New Jersey town, told ABC News that she has mixed feelings over how the Trump administration has rolled out tariffs.",
      "\"I'm kind of favorable for the tariffs, because I think we have been taken advantage of by different countries,\" she said. \"It's just that, maybe he's going a little overboard or too fast with all of this. And the tariffs are going to affect a lot more than they were originally going to.\"",
      "She hasn't felt any impact on her or her family's finances yet. Asked what she hopes to see from the White House going forward, she said she was hoping for the economy she felt America had during the first Trump administration.",
      "\"I look back to when he was in the office the first four years, and I just felt like the economy was in better shape,\" she said, mentioning interest rates and gas prices. \"I was kind of hoping we could get somewhere towards that point.\"",
      "She also told the poll she feels a recession is somewhat likely, and she hopes it does not impact the jobs she holds or her finances.",
      "\"But I'm at the point where I'm trying to get in a better financial position, just in case that recession should happen, it won't hit me as hard,\" she said.",

    "summary": "A federal judge blasted the Trump administration's termination of immigration records for thousands of foreign students in the U.S. as \"arbitrary and capricious.\"",
    "story": [
      "Ana Reyes said it shows an \"utter lack of concern for human individuals.\"",
      "A federal judge blasted the Trump administration's termination of immigration records for thousands of foreign students in the United States as \"arbitrary and capricious,\" demanding that the government provide detailed explanations as to why and how the records were terminated and what this means for students.",
      "\"I think we all agree it was arbitrary and capricious,\" Judge Ana Reyes said about the Trump administration's move to terminate records of foreign students in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a database that schools and government agencies used to confirm if foreign students are abiding by the conditions of their stay, during a court hearing for an international student's case in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday.",
      "\"This was not ideal by any stretch of the imagination,\" she continued.",
      "Akshar Patel, a computer science student from India, sued the Trump administration after his SEVIS record was recently terminated based on a speeding ticket from a few years ago. On the heels of the Trump administration's recent announcement that it is reinstating SEVIS records for some international students whose records had been terminated, Patel sought a preliminary injunction to ensure he can maintain his status and won't be detained or deported.",
      "\"It still boggles my mind that we're firing tens of thousands of federal workers on no notice and then take 10 to 20 of them to run a bunch of names through a database to see if there are students -- if they have a speeding record,\" Reyes said.",
      "Reyes, who is overseeing Patel's case, did not rule on the motion for a preliminary injunction from the bench on Tuesday after hearing from the government that Patel's legal status as a student has not been terminated and that he's not facing any immediate threat of deportation. The judge suggested that the plaintiff and the government could come up with language to ensure Patel's status in the United States.",
      "During the court hearing, Andre Watson, a senior official at the National Security Division of Homeland Security Investigations, explained that Patel was terminated due to a speeding ticket from a few years ago, was one of roughly 6,400 international students who were referred to the State Department after his team checked the records of nearly 1.3 million international students through the National Crime Information Center as part of its Criminal Alien Program initiative, which is aimed at identifying and removing migrants lacking legal status to be in the U.S. who also have criminal records.",
      "The thousands of international students who were referred to the State Department, and subsequently returned to the Department of Homeland Security, including Patel, came up on the NCIC database but did not necessarily have criminal records. Watson did not elaborate on how exactly the government combed through the names to decide whom it flagged.",
      "The judge was highly critical of the administration's process of terminating these students' immigration records and visas, taking particular notice of the sweeping nature of the mass terminations.",
      "\"After careful consideration for 15 minutes, terminate everybody, right?\" the judge questioned as she walked through the government's process of filtering through students' records and determining whose records to terminate. \"Can you and I agree that nowhere in this entire process has anyone done an individualized determination of any of these individuals before their names were terminated in SEVIS?\"",
      "\"I mean, no one looked at Mr. Patel's case and said that, yeah, here's somebody who should no longer be in the United States, right?\" Reyes continued.",
      "Noting that Patel had only received a citation in Texas for reckless driving but was never charged, Reyes said, \"You and I both agree that if we deported every single individual in this country who's been tasked for speeding, there'd be very few people left, and almost all of them would not have driver's license.\"",
      "\"You and I both know that Mr. Patel is not a criminal, right?\" she said, adding that Patel had even disclosed the speeding ticket in his visa petition. \"The United States government had already assessed this speeding ticket and had found it not to be a reason to kick him out of status.\"",
      "U.S. attorney Johnny Walker maintained that the SEVIS termination was merely a \"red flag\" to the school notifying it of the student's record, saying it is up to the school to terminate his student status.",
      "While Patel, who is scheduled to graduate in a few weeks, has continued to attend classes to finish his degree, lawyers representing other affected international students have said some schools saw it as more than a red flag -- thinking this meant their students needed to leave the country.",
      "While declining to rule from the bench after assurances from the government that Patel's student status is active, the judge criticized the administration's actions, describing it as an \"utter lack of concern for human individuals.\"",
      "\"Aside from the utter lack of concern for human individuals who we have invited into our country and who have made our communities richer by being students who have contributed to our colleges and who have paid our colleges -- the reason I'm concerned and particularly troubled is because those plaintiffs lawyers, like all lawyers, have to get paid, and so now we've got thousands of people who are having to pay plaintiff's attorneys to have litigation, to file briefs, to appear in court, prepare for court, to get the information, and that's not cheap, right?\" Reyes said.",
      "\"And all of this could have been avoided if individuals had taken a beat and instead of just rushing things,\" she continued.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:05:38 -0400",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump has utilized one of Project 2025's key tactics by overwhelming the courts and the public with constant policy changes, legal experts say.",
    "story": [
      "They say sweeping actions in his first 100 days will have long-term impact.",
      "On the campaign trail, and in the weeks leading up to his return to the White House, President Donald Trump vowed to hit the ground running -- what experts describe as a \"flood the zone\" strategy to push forward on his conservative and controversial policies.",
      "The pace has meant an often unprecedented first 100 days in office: \"Trump speed,\" the White House calls it.",
      "Earlier this month, he told Republican lawmakers at a party dinner: \"We're setting records right now. We're getting more things approved than any president has ever done in the first 100 days. It's not even close. I had somebody say the most successful month -- first month in the history. Now they said the most successful 100 days in the history of our country.\"",
      "How he's done so, legal experts told ABC News, will have a long-lasting impact on the presidency and the federal government.",
      "His main strategy has been to sign executive orders almost daily, including ones that challenge Congress' power to fund and oversee federal agencies and programs, while others relentlessly test the limits of immigration enforcement.",
      "Other presidents on both sides of the aisle have tried to flex their executive muscle, such as President Joe Biden's EO to require 50% of cars and light trucks sold to be zero-emission electric vehicles by 2030, according to Tabitha Bonilla, research assistant professor at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University.",
      "\"Every president over the last few decades have been trying to add more power to the executive branch and forward their agenda,\" Bonilla told ABC News. \"Trump is taking that to the extreme.\"",
      "As an example, experts cited Trump using legal and financial threats to punish universities and law firms for alleged political opposition and failure to \"align\" with his agenda, as well as his wholesale firings of top career officials, replacing them with loyalists.",
      "James Sample, a constitutional law expert at Hofstra University, said that Trump's playbook appears to be straight out of Project 2025, a blueprint for \"taking the reins of the federal government\" prepared for years by Trump's most conservative allies in anticipation of his comeback -- although Trump claimed to never have read it.",
      "Trump and his supporters said his actions are justified because unelected bureaucrats and judges, they claim, had seized control from presidents -- the one person elected nationwide, they argue, and granted total executive power by the Constitution.",
      "Regardless, Sample said, the tactic should raise a red flag.",
      "\"The purpose of a blitzkrieg is to overwhelm the opposition,\" he said.",
      "While Trump's tactics have been met with little to no protest from the Republican lawmakers who control the House and Senate, the judicial branch has often been ready to stem the flood through rulings and injunctions in dozens of court cases.",
      "Still, experts told ABC News, that even if all of Trump's moves are blocked or even reversed, they have done both serious short-term and long-term damage.",
      "\"It's all about implanting the narrative,\" Bonilla said. \"Trump's policies and rhetoric have pushed everything to the right and hurt our strength on the global scale.\"",
      "Floodgates opened",
      "Since Trump took office on Jan. 20, he has issued more than 140 executive orders on various policies as of Monday, shattering records and upending widely held interpretations of federal law and the Constitution.",
      "President Joe Biden, by comparison, issued 162 EOs in his entire term, and Trump issued more than 30 executive orders during the first 100 days of his first term, according to historical records.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles told Fox News in March that in this second term, the Trump team knew it needed to act fast, citing the midterm elections in November 2026 that could change the congressional map.",
      "\"This 18 months is our time frame. One hundred days, certainly six months into the year, and 18 months, are sort of our benchmarks,\" she said.",
      "The \"flood the zone\" goal has been long-touted by Trump's allies.",
      "His former White House political adviser Steve Bannon appeared to coin the idea during Trump's first term. After Trump left office, conservative activists and Trump loyalists crafted a proposed battle plan for a second term.",
      "In a 2023 speech, Russell Vought, a chief architect of Project 2025 and now Trump's current director of the Office of Management and Budget, laid out one strategy at his Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump Washington think tank.",
      "\"I want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected because they are increasingly viewed as villains. We want to put them in trauma,\" he said in a speech reported by ProPublica.",
      "Video of his making that speech was brought up during Vought's confirmation hearings earlier this year but he repeatedly avoiding answering questions about his provocative rhetoric and plans.",
      "Many of Trump's EOs have dealt with Elon Musk's brainchild -- the Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed agency budgets and tens of thousands of federal employees throughout the country, while others have pushed forward the president's crackdown on immigration, such as the end to birthright citizenship and deporting migrants as alleged foreign invaders under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Bernadette Meyler, the Carl and Sheila Spaeth professor of law at Stanford Law School, told ABC News that executive orders have always been a tool presidents have used to set their agenda, even if just symbolically.",
      "\"It is an effective tactic. It's difficult even for courts to react rapidly,\" Meyler said.",
      "Conservative groups have long advocated for a federal government shakeup and agued that the president needed more power to make the country more efficient.",
      "\"What he's doing is kickstarting what will ultimately be our legislative agenda,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in January after Trump's first round of executive orders.",
      "The Heritage Foundation, the far right think tank that helped to produce Project 2025, has contended that Trump's efforts are essential and fast action can make the government more efficient.",
      "Lindsey Burke, director of the Center for Education Policy at The Heritage Foundation, and Jonathan Butcher, a senior research fellow at the think tank, referenced this idea in a statement last month after Trump issued an executive order for a drastic reduction in force for the Department of Education.",
      "\"Reducing the bloated bureaucracy will give state and local education officials more decision-making authority,\" they said.",
      "War of words, resistance to courts",
      "Legal experts said another effective aspect of the \"flood the zone\" tactic was Trump's multiple media appearances and photo ops, where he continues to make controversial and provocative claims.",
      "Meyler contends Trump's war of words is part of a deeper tactic to undermine the public's trust in the federal government.",
      "She noted even with courts issuing injunctions, Trump's statements and resistance to judge's orders with aggressive appeals has still moved the needle more toward the right.",
      "\"It can seem he is doing a lot even without of lot of judicial action,\" Meyler said.",
      "How much steam is left?",
      "Trump and his allies have been adamant that they will stick to their plans to reassert the powers of the executive branch long after the first 100 days are up and are vowing to take all of their cases up to the Supreme Court if necessary.",
      "As of Sunday, there have been 217 court cases against the second Trump administration, according to an ABC News accounting, and a large majority of those have led to temporary restraining orders, reversals and, in some cases, full-on blocks of Trump's agenda.",
      "\"In the first Trump administration, we saw a lot of executive actions in the beginning and then saw it slow down,\" Bonilla said. \"We will be living in the space of a lot happening all at once for a while, but at some point, there is going to be a moment where there is so much that [the executive branch] can't keep up.\"",
      "Meyler agreed but added that Trump, the Project 2025 architects and their allies have stated that they are willing to work with Congress to get their agenda passed through legislative channels.",
      "\"That might secure his policies, and slow things down, and avoid the courts,\" she said.",
      "That pivot will meet more resistance, especially as we approach the midterms, according to Meyler.",
      "\"It's easier for some than others because of various practical matters, but there is a tipping point,\" she said. \"People are already protesting and Trump's public ratings are dipping.\"",
      "Still, future presidents will likely emulate the \"flood the zone\" tactic in their first weeks, according to Meyler.",
      "\"Over the long course of presidential history, there is rarely a retraction of presidential power,\" she said.",

      "Democrats, responding to the 100-day mark of President Donald Trump's second term, argue that the American public's opinion of the White House and Republicans in Congress -- as well as consternation around high prices -- give them an opening to flip the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2026.",
      "In a strategy memo obtained exclusively by ABC News, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the campaign arm of House Democrats, wrote, \"In just 100 days, House Republicans and Donald Trump have lost the support of the American people and left a trail of broken promises that will cost them the House majority next year.\"",
      "Recent polls show approval ratings for Trump and congressional Republicans are underwater -- although congressional Democrats have sometimes performed even worse. In a recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, Trump beats Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems.",
      "The DCCC, however, argues in the memo that Democrats have momentum. The group pointed to ads from some Republican members during the 2024 campaign cycle where they said they would work to get costs down, claiming that they and others have abandoned those promises. The group also alleged that the recent budget blueprint passed by House Republicans will potentially lead to cuts to Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Republicans have argued that the budget blueprint does not and will not threaten any benefits or entitlements and that Democrats are causing undue fear. Some also blame actions by the previous White House under Democratic President Joe Biden or factors outside of anyone's control have caused higher prices.",
      "\"The DCCC and House Democrats will continue to fight back and hold Republicans accountable for their broken promises ... With every new bill that gets introduced, committee meeting held, and amendment vote taken, the American people will know that Republicans don\u2019t work for them, they work for the billionaires,\" the Democratic group wrote.",
      "And looking to 2026, the DCCC added, \"Their trail of broken promises have helped to put House Democrats on offense with an expansive battleground map, including more initial Districts in Play than any cycle since 2018. The DCCC will continue to build upon this momentum on our way to taking back the House next year.\"",
      "Republicans held on to a slim majority in the House in the 2024 election.",
      "The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the campaign arm of House Republicans, has expressed confidence that the GOP will hold the House in the 2026 midterms. The group celebrated Trump's 100 day mark on Tuesday as a milestone for momentum for an agenda the group said is revitalizing the country.",
      "NRCC chair Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., wrote in a statement on Tuesday, \"In just 100 days, President Trump has reignited American greatness. He's secured our border, put America back on top, and restored the American Dream. House Republicans will continue working with him and building on this historic momentum.\"",
      "The DCCC's memo comes as Democratic officials and other figures mark 100 days of Trump's second term in office, although the party is still divided over how to rebuild after its losses in 2024.",
      "To mark the 100-day milestone, Democratic mayors and governors have been pointing to federal government spending cuts or new policies that they say have a deleterious impact on their states.",
      "A few well-known governors, including Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker -- who created buzz during remarks on Sunday in New Hampshire when he said that \"these Republicans cannot know a moment of peace\" -- will be holding a virtual town hall on Tuesday night about \"how Democratic governors are standing up to protect the people in their states,\" according to the Democratic Governors Association.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic members of Congress and party officials have been marking the run-up to the 100-day mark with town halls and protests. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and House Majority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., staged an hours-long \"sit-in\" on the House steps on Sunday to protest Congressional Republicans' budget plans.",
      "Some Democrats have argued that the disparate responses to the administration are actually a strength for the party while it is locked out of power in Washington.",
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who was the running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024, said at a talk on Monday night that the Democratic Party needs to \"flood the zone\" and \"fill every single lane, and if there's one that's better than another, then let's all pick that lane and do more of that.\"",

      "Thousands of people have been let go at federal agencies and critical research has been put on hold. Additionally, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has questioned the safety and efficacy of vaccines and antidepressant medications despite dozens of studies proving they are safe and effective.",
      "Doctors and public health specialists critical of the administration tell ABC News they view these actions as an \"attack\" on science, damaging the reputation of respected agencies and by questioning what is believed to be established science.",
      "\"It's completely unprecedented,\" Steve Cohen, senior vice dean of Columbia University's School of Professional Studies and a professor of public affairs at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs, told ABC News. \"It's frankly a little unhinged. I've never seen anything like it.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "An HHS official told ABC News that framing the actions of the admiration as an \"attack\" is \"fundamentally dishonest.\"",
      "\"Further reviewing pharmaceutical products with gold standard science and common sense is not an'\"attack on science' \u2014 it's what the American people have asked for and deserve,\" the official said. \" Let's be clear: Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine \u2014 he is pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.\"",
      "Thousands of layoffs",
      "Earlier this month, HHS began to lay off 10,000 workers as part of a massive restructuring plan.",
      "Sources previously told ABC News that affected offices included most of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health, key offices in the Center for Tobacco Products, most of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the entire assisted reproductive technology team at the CDC.",
      "There have also been local impacts in communities due to federal layoffs. ABC News previously reported in March, the CDC was poised to send its lead 'disease detectives' to Milwaukee amid an ongoing lead crisis in schools, but the entire division was cut under sweeping HHS layoffs, leaving local health officials without help they were relying on.",
      "Erik Svendsen, the director of the division that oversaw the CDC's Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention branch, previously told ABC News that what's happening in Milwaukee is a real world example of the impact of their absence.",
      "\"Without us, there is no other unit at the federal level that is here to support them in doing what they need to do,\" he said.",
      "On Monday, officials in Milwaukee announced two additional schools are closing due to this crisis",
      "Despite Kennedy saying some programs and employees would soon be reinstated because they were mistakenly cut, it still leaves thousands of federal employees without jobs.",
      "Scientists have also been laid off at NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Cohen said these firings have put studies on hold and have greatly reduced the capacity of the federal government to review research.",
      "\"Scientists inside agencies, whether they're environmental scientists or medical scientists or people focusing on vaccines or drugs, are being fired, and so some of the research capacity in Washington, in the federal government is being eliminated, and also their ability to judge proposals from universities,\" he said.",
      "\"The only place I haven't seen [firings] happen yet are the laboratories,\" Cohen added.",
      "Cuts that are currently proposed or have already been implemented include the elimination of the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV Policy, created by Brett Giroir, the former U.S. assistant secretary for health.",
      "Giroir, who helped convince Trump in his first term to set a goal to end the HIV epidemic in the U.S., wrote in a post on social media last week that the president could ruin his legacy and mission with such cuts.",
      "Canceling research grants, funding cuts to universities",
      "Millions of dollars' worth of grants have been terminated at the National Institutes of Health related to studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) because they do not \"effectuate\" the \"priorities\" of President Donald Trump's administration, according to copies of termination letters sent to grant recipients and viewed by ABC News.",
      "Dr. Harold Varmus, a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and former director of the NIH, said these terminations are \"detrimental\" because they may be affecting people in the middle of clinical trials, or affecting the early stages of experimental work.",
      "Research projects focusing on minority populations have major benefits, Varmus noted.",
      "\"The purpose of health research in this country is to address problems faced by everybody and to explore every facet of a population that may affect their health,\" he said. \"To single out certain categories of individuals who would not be appropriate to study seems ludicrous to me ... one of the great strengths of America is that we are diverse.\"",
      "Universities have also been threatened with funding cuts -- or have seen funds frozen -- if they don't fulfill their obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to protect Jewish students on campus and to end race-based programs.",
      "Cohen believes universities are at odds with the administration because some on the political right view universities as \"left wing.\" By \"weakening the finances of universities, they can force them to change the ideologies that they believe are being promoted in the classrooms,\" he argued.",
      "The problem with this idea, according to Cohen, is that the administration's actions are hurting the least ideological parts of universities, such as engineering schools or medical centers. At Columbia, for example, several institutes and centers are conducting Alzheimer's research, he said.",
      "\"Those are the places that are being attacked,\" Cohen said. \"It's pretty ironic, but the greatest danger, actually, is that one of America's fundamental economic strengths is the creativity and the innovation of our scientists, and that is now under attack by the Trump administration.\"",
      "Questioning safety, efficacy of vaccines",
      "Kennedy has shared vaccine skepticism in the past and has continued to do so as HHS secretary.",
      "In the wake of several ongoing measles outbreaks and over 800 cases so far this year, Kennedy has shared contradicting views about vaccines.",
      "In a post on X on April 6, he said that \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles\" is to receive the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, in a post later that evening, he said more than 300 children have been treated with an antibiotic and a steroid, neither of which are cures for measles.",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the statements Kennedy has made in support of the MMR vaccine are \"half-hearted.\"",
      "\"The reason I say 'half-hearted' or insufficient is because each time he talks about using the MMR vaccine, he qualifies it,\" Hotez told ABC News. \"He then draws this false equivalency between either getting the MMR vaccine or this cocktail of interventions that would do absolutely nothing.\"",
      "Last month, HHS confirmed that the CDC will study \"all the potential culprits\" including whether vaccines cause autism despite numerous existing studies already showing there is no link.",
      "Hotez said epidemiologic studies show that children who received either the MMR vaccine, or vaccines containing thimerosal -- a compound used as a preservative in vaccines -- are not more likely to be diagnosed autism than kids who didn't receive those vaccines.",
      "Additionally, Hotez said about 100 genes have been identified that are involved in the development of autism, many by the Broad Institute at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "He believes rising rates of autism diagnoses are likely due to wider testing and expanding diagnostic criteria. Hotez added that there could be an environmental exposure influencing autism genes, but that it's not vaccines.",
      "In 2017, he discussed with Kennedy an investigation looking at \"about half a dozen chemical exposures\" in early pregnancies but Kennedy \"had no interest,\" according to Hotez, who later documented these conversations in a book he published in 2018.",
      "\"He apparently seems to not understand the science or doesn't care about the science. He's got his fixed beliefs and doesn't want to let any of the facts or scientific findings get in the way of his fixed belief,\" Hotez said. \"And it's completely irresponsible having someone like that as Health and Human Services secretary.\"",
      "Claims around antidepressant use",
      "Earlier this year, Trump issued an executive order to study the use of several medications including antidepressants and antipsychotics.",
      "The order called for the formation of the \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission -- to be chaired by Kennedy -- with an aim to understand chronic diseases.",
      "Among the goals of the commission is to \"assess the prevalence of and threat posed by the prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and weight-loss drugs.\"",
      "Dr. Joseph Saseen, associate dean for clinical affairs and a professor in the departments of clinical pharmacy and family medicine at the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Colorado, said there are plenty of studies and analyses in the medical literature looking at the prevalence of SSRIs.",
      "\"We have an overwhelming amount of information,\" he told ABC News. \"These medicines, particularly SSRIs, are the most frequently prescribed antidepressants for patients with major depressive disorder. There is a plethora of information evaluating efficacy in a broad range of patient populations for which these medicines are indicated.\"",
      "Saseen says these medications do have side effects, just like any drug, but the benefits significantly outweigh the risks for most people in the general population who have major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders.",
      "Kennedy has also falsely linked the use of antidepressants to school shootings and claimed during his Senate confirmation hearings that members of his family had a harder time stopping SSRI use than heroin use.",
      "Experts have said there is no evidence that equates ending the use of antidepressants to ending the use of heroin or to suggest that people on SSRIs are more likely to be violent.",
      "Saseen said it's reasonable to question scientific research, either to reaffirm or dispute findings, but it must be done following the scientific method.",
      "\"Question it the real way, not the cowardly way,\" he said. \"The cowardly way is labeling things as threats or as bad without taking a scientific approach. The key is you need to use appropriate methodologies, not vocal inflections and very triggering and polarizing words to create an uprising.\"",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump, in his first 100 days in office, has wielded his pen to radically implement his agenda at a breakneck pace.",
    "story": [
      "\"He's trying to do government by executive order,\" one expert said.",
      "One hundred days ago this week, just hours after taking the oath of office and reveling before a crowd of thousands at Capital One Arena, President Donald Trump signed the first executive orders of his second term.",
      "With the stroke of his pen, he maintained he could freeze environmental and other agency regulations Congress had authorized. With another, he withdrew the U.S. from an international climate agreement.",
      "\"You're witnessing the dawn of the golden age of America,\" he told the roaring crowd. \"That's what it's going to be.\"",
      "Overall, he's issued more than 130 executive orders and even more memorandums, declared at least eight national emergencies and engaged in a showdown with the courts that has prompted debate on whether a constitutional crisis is underway.",
      "Driving much of his action is a legal theory advocated by conservatives that the Constitution gives a president nearly unquestioned control over the federal government.",
      "Trump and his top officials also contend that he's simply working to implement the agenda that Americans voted for in November.",
      "But other constitutional and legal experts who spoke with ABC News call it unparalleled overreach.",
      "\"This really is unprecedented,\" Elizabeth Goitein, the senior director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program, told ABC News.",
      "\"We've seen really broad theories of executive power advanced in previous administrations,\" Goitein said. \"There's been a steady trend over the last few decades towards increasingly broad views of executive power, especially after 9/11. But this is unprecedented and it's different in kind, not just in degree.\"",
      "Trump, in a recent interview with Time to mark 100 days, disagreed.",
      "\"Well, I don't feel I'm expanding it,\" Trump told the magazine when asked about amassing presidential power. \"I think I'm using it as it was meant to be used.\"",
      "Trump's 'government by executive order'",
      "Nearly every day since Jan. 20, Trump has signed executive actions in the Oval Office, often in front of television cameras. He's signed the greatest number of executive orders in his first 100 days of any president going back 88 years.",
      "\"He's trying to do government by executive order on a whole range of issues,\" said David Schultz, a constitutional law expert at Hamline University.",
      "Following Trump's lead, his administration has carried out a dramatic purge of what Congress had set up as independent agencies, firing tens of thousands of employees, even those with civil service protections. He's also sought to wipe out diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives across the federal government.",
      "Trump signed an order to diminish the Department of Education, with the ultimate goal of wiping away the agency established by law. He's tried to effectively end birthright citizenship, which is enshrined in the 14th Amendment and has been upheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court.",
      "To move forward with his immigration and economic policies, Trump has declared national emergencies that Goitein, an expert on presidential emergency powers, said are unjustified.",
      "Despite border crossings being down, Trump invoked the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport hundreds of Venezuelan migrants his administration alleged to be gang members, affording them little to no due process.",
      "He invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act in order to impose sweeping tariffs on virtually all U.S. trading partners. Though it is Congress, not the president, that has the power to impose taxes and regulate trade -- and the emergency power used by Trump makes no mention of tariffs.",
      "At times, he's used the power of the presidency to pursue retribution on political opponents. Seemingly contrary to his promise to end the \"weaponization\" of government and the justice system, he's signed orders targeting specific law firms that took on clients or cases he disagreed with politically. He directed the Justice Department to investigate Chris Krebbs and Miles Taylor, two officials from his first term who've criticized him or challenged his 2020 election falsehoods.",
      "Trump's harshest critics say some action verges on authoritarianism, noting his open respect for \"strongman\" leaders, including China's President Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Hungary's Viktor Orban.",
      "\"Sometimes you need a strongman,\" Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity last September while campaigning.",
      "Pushback from the courts -- but not from Congress",
      "\"Our Framers were envisioning that if a president tried to do things like this, Congress would step in,\" said Schultz. \"And right now, it looks like partisanship is more powerful than checks and balances.\"",
      "Despite having Republican majorities (albeit narrow ones) in the House and Senate, Trump has opted to largely go it alone on his agenda in his first 100 days. Republicans on Capitol Hill, so far, appear uninterested or unwilling to seriously challenge him.",
      "\"We're all afraid,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of the few Republicans to be critical of Trump, told her Alaskan constituents last month. Murkowski added that \"retaliation is real.\"",
      "While congressional pushback has been minimal, a clear clash is underway between the Trump administration and the courts as various groups and individuals challenge his policies.",
      "Trump has berated judges who ruled against him as \"radical left\" and called for District Judge James Boasberg's impeachment. He and Vice President JD Vance openly floated the idea of not abiding by lower court orders -- \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,\" Trump posted on social media -- though later said they would comply with decisions from the Supreme Court.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts issued a rare statement in rebuke of the rhetoric -- and though he didn't mention Trump by name, the context was clear.",
      "In a major escalation of the administration's standoff with the courts, the FBI last week arrested a Milwaukee judge, Hannah Dugan, and accused her of obstructing immigration agents. An attorney for Dugan said she will \"defend herself vigorously and looks forward to being exonerated.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about the incident, left open the possibility of the Justice Department taking more action against federal judges or even Supreme Court justices if they were obstructing the arrest of anyone suspected of being in the country illegally.",
      "\"He thinks he can either ignore or bully his way through,\" Schultz said of Trump's posture toward the judiciary. \"And so far, he's got a mixed record at best in terms of being able to do that.\"",
      "Several legal experts and presidential scholars who spoke to ABC News expressed concern that the courts will become inundated by Trump's moves as his second term continues, and the system of checks and balances will continue to break down.",
      "\"The separation of powers is probably the most important protection that we have against presidents becoming kings,\" said Goitein. \"If this is the new normal, then we can say goodbye to democracy.\"",

      "\"The court has learned that Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan has been charged with two federal criminal offenses, one of which is a felony and one of which is a misdemeanor,\" a two-page order from the court filed Tuesday stated.",
      "\"This court is charged in the Wisconsin Constitution with exercising superintending and administrative authority over the courts of this state. In the exercise of that constitutional authority and in order to uphold the public's confidence in the courts of this state during the pendency of the criminal proceeding against Judge Dugan, we conclude, on our own motion, that it is in the public interest that she be temporarily relieved of her official duties.\"",
      "Dugan was charged with two criminal counts of \"obstructing and impeding a proceeding before a department or agency of the United States\" and \"concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest,\" according to a criminal complaint unsealed Friday.",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court said Dugan is \"temporarily prohibited from exercising the powers of a circuit court judge in the State of Wisconsin,\" effective Tuesday until further order from the court.",
      "Prior to the order, a Milwaukee County official said this week that starting Monday, a reserve judge will cover Dugan's cases.",
      "The judge was arrested on Friday over allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant \"evade arrest\" the week prior, according to FBI Director Kash Patel, who claimed on social media that Dugan \"intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse.\"",
      "U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement that two FBI agents arrested Dugan \"for allegedly helping an illegal alien avoid arrest\" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Duegan appeared in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on Friday on the two charges but did not enter a plea. She was released on her own recognizance.",
      "Her attorney, former United States Attorney Steven Biskupic, said the judge will \"defend herself vigorously and looks forward to being exonerated.\"",
      "\"Judge Hannah C. Dugan has committed herself to the rule of law and the principles of due process for her entire career as a lawyer and a judge,\" Biskupic said in a statement on Friday.",
      "If convicted on the charges, Dugan could face up to six years in prison.",
      "Her case stems from the arrest of an undocumented immigrant -- Eduardo Flores-Ruiz -- on April 18, county court records show. Flores-Ruiz was set to appear in court that day before Dugan for a pretrial conference in an ongoing case where he has been charged with three misdemeanor counts of battery/domestic abuse.",
      "Upon learning ICE officers were present in court to arrest Flores-Ruiz, Dugan allegedly became \"visibly angry\" and confronted one of the officers, according to the federal complaint.",
      "Multiple witnesses cited in the complaint later allegedly said Dugan returned to her courtroom after directing members of the arrest team to the office of the court's chief judge, according to the complaint.",
      "A DEA agent saw Flores-Ruiz and his attorney in the public hallway of the courthouse and he appeared to be making efforts to evade arrest, the complaint stated. After he was encountered by FBI and DEA agents outside the building, Flores-Ruiz \"turned around and sprinted down the street\" before he was ultimately apprehended, according to the complaint.",

      "North Carolina Republicans managed just last fall to enact their long-sought policy ordering local sheriffs to cooperate with federal agents seeking to deport certain jail inmates",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republicans who last fall enacted their long-sought policy ordering local sheriffs to cooperate with federal agents seeking to deport certain jail inmates already want it tightened further as President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown builds nationwide.",
      "The GOP-controlled state House approved a measure Tuesday that would subject people accused of more categories of crimes in the ninth-largest state to inquiries about their immigration status and potential deportation.",
      "After then-Gov. Roy Cooper's veto was overridden, a law took effect in December that directed jails to hold for 48 hours certain defendants whom U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement believe are in the country illegally, allowing time for ICE to pick them up. The alleged offenders are the subject of ICE detainers and administrative warrants to temporary hold inmates suspected of violating immigration laws.",
      "The latest legislation also would make clear that jail officials must contact federal immigration agents if they are holding someone with these documents and tell them when they would otherwise be released.",
      "Backers of the 2024 law \u2014 new House Speaker Destin Hall among them \u2014 said it would make communities safer, and that for years several sheriffs in predominantly Democratic counties were disregarding detainers. Cooper, a Democrat, had vetoed successfully similar immigration measures since 2019. calling them unconstitutional and divisive. But the GOP held veto-proof majorities in 2024.",
      "Some behind the new bill say the law needs to be upgraded to align more closely with efforts by Trump and other Republicans in Washington to keep defendants from being released back onto the streets where they could possibly commit more crimes.",
      "State Rep. Carson Smith, a bill sponsor and former Pender County sheriff, pointed recently to the new federal Laken Riley Act, which requires the detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of theft and violent crimes.",
      "Hall said during Tuesday\u2019s floor debate that about five of the state\u2019s 100 sheriffs are still \u201ccertainly violating the spirit that was behind\u201d the 2024 state law. Mecklenburg County Sheriff Garry McFadden has been in a public feud with ICE leaders over whether he must alert agents about people in his jail who are subject to detainers. North Carolina sheriffs usually operate county jails.",
      "\u201cThis bill fixes any perceived loophole and resolves a dangerous problem in this state,\u201d Hall said before Tuesday's 70-45 vote.",
      "The 2024 law ordered a jail administrator to attempt to determine the legal residency of those jailed who are accused of the most violent felonies, some misdemeanors and domestic violence order violations. The new measure would expand that list to in part include all felonies and impaired-driving offenses.",
      "The current law and the new proposal states that if the jailer determines that ICE has issued a detainer and administrative warrant, the inmate must be taken before a judicial official before they could be otherwise released.",
      "The current law says that once the judicial official determines the inmate is subject to the detainer, the person must be held up to 48 hours after the detainer's receipt. Otherwise, the inmate can be released. But under the new bill, the 48-hour period would begin once the time the person otherwise would have been released has come to an end.",
      "The bill now goes to the Senate for consideration.",
      "Democrats opposed to the bill say the measure is another effort to vilify immigrants who have been accused \u2014 but not convicted \u2014 of crimes, as well as to embrace Trump administration's efforts to scapegoat people from other countries in the U.S.",
      "During committee debate this month, Mario Alfaro with Latino advocacy group El Pueblo told lawmakers the bill \u201camplifies anti-immigrant narratives that ignore the enormous contributions of the immigrant population, increase the risk of racial profiling and only generates fear and distrust in local law enforcement.\u201d",
      "The North Carolina Sheriffs\u2019 Association supports the bill, association Executive Vice President Eddie Caldwell told the House committee.",
      "If passed by both chambers, the bill would go to new Democratic Gov. Josh Stein. He didn\u2019t immediately respond Tuesday to an email seeking comment on it. Democrats now hold enough General Assembly seats that a Stein veto could be upheld if they remain united.",

      "A federal judge says Idaho prison officials must allow media witnesses at executions to watch as the lethal injection drugs are prepared and administered to the condemned person",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- Idaho prison officials must allow media witnesses at executions to watch as lethal injection drugs are prepared and administered to a condemned person, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Debora K. Grasham ordered the Idaho Department of Correction to provide the audio and visual access for any executions that occur while a First Amendment lawsuit from a coalition of news organizations moves forward in court. The state doesn't have any executions scheduled, Grasham noted, so prison officials have time to install a closed-circuit audio and visual feed before they are again tasked with putting someone to death.",
      "The Associated Press, The Idaho Statesman and East Idaho News sued the state's prison director in December, arguing that key steps of the lethal injection process were being unconstitutionally hidden from public view.",
      "\u201cWhile it is true that this case concerns Idaho\u2019s lethal injection execution procedures, it equally concerns the public\u2019s First Amendment right of access to the State\u2019s administration of the most severe penalty enforced by our State,\u201d Grasham wrote.",
      "Executions \u2014 including the means and methods used to carry them out \u2014 have historically been open to the public in the United States, Grasham wrote. Today, media witnesses act as surrogates for the public at large by viewing and then reporting on the execution process.",
      "Grasham made clear that her ruling did not make a policy judgment about the death penalty itself, but instead \u201cattempts to safeguard the constitutional right belonging to the public under the First Amendment of access to executions conducted by the state, so that such policy decisions can be well-informed.\"",
      "Idaho's execution protocols currently allow media witnesses to watch as a condemned person is brought into the execution chamber, placed on a gurney, and has the IV inserted and attached to medical tubing that leads into another room. Witnesses can also watch as the condemned person dies. But the actual preparation and administration of the deadly chemicals is done in a separate part of the facility, and that process has always been hidden from view.",
      "During a hearing earlier this month, Tanner Smith, the attorney representing prison officials, said the public can rely on prison officials to accurately tell them whether the preparation and administration of the drugs was successful. He also said that keeping the \u201cmedication room\u201d hidden from public view helps protect the identities of the volunteers who carry out that work.",
      "But Grasham said the state failed to show why those volunteers couldn't just protect their identities by using the same face coverings, gloves and hats that are used by the execution team members who already work in view of media witnesses. Prison officials failed to show the secrecy was necessary for legitimate penological interests, rather than \u201cexaggerated response,\u201d she wrote.",
      "\"This Court finds it difficult to identify any aspect of an execution by lethal injection that is more 'inextricably intertwined' with the execution than the actual preparation and administration of the lethal injection drugs into the IV lines connected to the condemned individual,\" Grasham wrote.",
      "Twenty-seven states authorize the death penalty, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, though some have paused executions or do not have anyone on death row. The states also vary widely on how many media witnesses they allow at executions, as well as how much of the process witnesses are allowed to see.",
      "This is not the first time The Associated Press and other news organizations have sued Idaho officials in an attempt to increase execution access. In 2012, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered prison officials to allow the news organizations to view the first part of lethal injection executions, including when a condemned person is brought into the execution chamber, secured to the execution gurney and the IV is inserted.",
      "Idaho has attempted four lethal injection executions since the 1970s. Three of them were completed, but the most recent attempt, involving Thomas Eugene Creech, was aborted last year after execution team members were unable to successfully establish an IV line after eight attempts in Creech\u2019s arms and legs.",
      "Lawmakers passed a new law this year that will make firing squads the state\u2019s primary method of execution, starting next year.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida is poised to become the second state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, over the concerns of dentists and public health advocates who say the mineral is a safe, effective way to protect people of all ages from developing cavities.",
      "Florida lawmakers gave final approval to the bill Tuesday after Utah became the first state to pass a ban last month. The Republican-led states are following a push led by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is setting the gears of government in motion to stop fluoridating water.",
      "The Florida measure now goes to the desk of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose administration has advocated against the fluoridation of community water systems, arguing high levels could pose a risk to children\u2019s intellectual development.",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water is considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "\u201cAs dentists, we see the direct consequences fluoride removal has on our patients and it\u2019s a real tragedy when policymakers\u2019 decisions hurt vulnerable kids and adults in the long term,\u201d Brett Kessler, president of the American Dental Association, said in a statement earlier this month. \u201cBlindly calling for a ban on fluoridated water hurts people, costs money, and will ultimately harm our economy.\u201d",
      "While Florida's bill doesn't specifically reference fluoride, it will require the mineral and some other additives be removed from water sources across the state, said bill sponsor Republican state Rep. Kaylee Tuck.",
      "\u201cAnything that relates to water quality, removing contaminants, things like that, we're not touching that,\" Tuck said. \"It's anything that has to do with health. So fluoride, vitamins, whatever else it is.\u201d",
      "Some local officials in Florida have already voted to remove the mineral from their community water systems, ahead of state lawmakers' push to ban fluoride.",
      "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Tuesday she is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the passage of the bill, adding that it disregards \u201cthe overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health.\u201d",
      "Levine Cava said that ending fluoridation, which is a safe and cost-effective way to prevent tooth decay, will have \u201clong-lasting health consequences, especially for our most vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "The mayor said the decision should be left to local communities.",

      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York is expected to create a new criminal charge to levy against people who wear a mask while committing another crime.",
      "The proposal is set to be included in a sweeping state budget bill that will be taken up by lawmakers in the coming days, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday.",
      "The measure would make it a misdemeanor for a person to \u201cuse a mask to conceal their identity when committing a Class A misdemeanor or higher crime or fleeing the scene immediately after committing such a crime,\" her office said.",
      "The move comes almost a year after the governor floated the idea banning masks in the New York City subway system because of what she described as concern about people hiding their faces while committing antisemitic acts.",
      "The idea drew swift pushback from critics who argued a mask ban could stifle protests if people participating wanted to hide their identities to avoid professional or personal repercussions. Masks were required on New York City subways during the COVID-19 pandemic, and some transit riders have continued covering their faces in an effort to protect themselves against poor air quality underground.",
      "Hochul, a Democrat, had admitted that a mask ban would be difficult to craft and noted that it would have to include exemptions for health, cultural or religious reasons. No legislation immediately emerged on the subject.",
      "Months later, state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat, introduced a bill that would have made it a crime for people to wear face masks to harass or threaten someone. Hochul appeared open to the senator's approach, but critics argued the proposal could lead to subjective enforcement and the proposal did not make it far in the legislative process.",
      "The idea reemerged during recent negotiations over the state budget, carried new weight as the Trump administration has cracked down on international students and scholars who have criticized Israel or participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.",
      "Hochul, at a press conference on Monday, said the term mask ban \u201cwas probably an overstatement\u201d but still claimed victory on the issue.",
      "\u201cWhat people are looking for is to not have someone be able to get away with wearing a mask when they\u2019re harming another person, or committing a crime or harassing, or threatening. We got to that, that\u2019s exactly what this does,\u201d she said.",
      "In an interview, Skoufis said the current proposal responds to concerns about mask wearing while \u201creducing the subjectivity that could be involved with law enforcement.\"",
      "The Trump administration's recent actions influenced negotiations on the policy, Skoufis said.",
      "\u201cWhere we landed provides no \u2014 and I mean no \u2014 additional opportunity or tool or mechanism to ICE or federal law enforcement that does not already exist for them here in New York state,\u201d he said, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Allie Bohm, senior policy counsel at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said Hochul's initial mask ban proposal was \u201cdeeply unpopular\u201d and would have endangered protestors who are now concerned with being identified by the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWe have a federal government that has made clear that it is planning to target and is targeting people it disagrees with, and that very much includes protestors,\" Bohm said.",

Gretchen Whitmer, as they appeared together to announce a new fighter jet mission being placed at an Air National Guard base outside Detroit and ease fears that the installation could close.",
      "Trump delivered the news at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County, shortly after arriving in Michigan for an evening rally marking his 100th day in office. He was joined by Whitmer, who has softened her stance toward Trump in hopes of finding common ground \u2014 with securing a new mission for the base a top priority.",
      "For decades, Trump said the base has \u201cstood as a crucial pillar of North American air defense.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn recent years, many in Michigan have feared for the future of the base. They\u2019ve been calling everybody, but the only one that mattered is Trump,\" he said. \u201cToday I have come in person to lay to rest any doubt about Selfridge\u2019s future.\u201d",
      "After Trump and Whitmer hugged upon the president disembarking Air Force One, she climbed in his motorcade to ride to the base. During his remarks, Trump said the governor has been \u201cvery effective\u201d in advocating for the base.",
      "State officials had been pushing for years to replace the base\u2019s aging fleet of A-10 aircraft, which are set to be retired, to help ensure Selfridge remains in operation. Trump had suggested that new fighter jets could secure Selfridge's future, including the likes of F-16s or F-35s.",
      "Located 30 miles north of Detroit, the base generates an estimated $850 million in statewide economic impact and supports about 5,000 military and civilian personnel, according to the office of Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich.",
      "For years, Whitmer has pressed multiple administrations \u2014 including Trump\u2019s first term and former Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s \u2014 to secure a new mission for the base, calling it \u201ca key defense hub and economic anchor.\u201d The Air Force announced in 2017 that Selfridge had lost out on a bid for F-35A Lightning.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth traveled separately from the president to Selfrdige for the announcement. But military implications aside, Trump\u2019s announcement handed Whitmer a victory \u2014 though it remains to be seen what political price she may have paid to secure it.",
      "The governor has been frequently mentioned as a potential presidential candidate. As she works to raise her profile nationally, Whitmer has vowed to find common ground with Trump where she can. But some Democrats view the president and his administration as so harmful that they'd rather see the party oppose Trump and his team whenever possible.",
      "Earlier this month, Whitmer traveled to Washington to meet with Trump to discuss Selfridge and other issues affecting Michigan, including the steep tariffs Trump has imposed on Canada and other U.S. trading partners. The governor said she was unexpectedly ushered into the Oval Office, where she stood awkwardly as the Republican president signed executive orders and assailed his political opponents during a photo opportunity.",
      "At one point, a photo captured Whitmer trying to hide her face from the cameras by holding up a folder.",
      "Trump had told Whitmer during her visit that he hoped to keep the base \u201copen, strong, thriving.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great piece of property. It\u2019s a great location, and it\u2019s a great state,\" Trump said. \"So I think we\u2019re going to come back with a very good answer.\u201d",
      "He followed through on that Tuesday, at a time when Michigan has seen its unemployment rate rise for three consecutive months, including a 1.3% jump in March, reaching 5.5%, according to state data. That fare exceeds the national average.",

      "NEW YORK -- A baby vulture at a New York zoo is being fed not by another bird but by hand puppet \u2014 a decades-old technique used to ensure the chick doesn\u2019t identify too closely with its human handlers.",
      "King vultures can neglect their chicks, so hand-feeding is necessary to ensure the baby survives, the Bronx Zoo said in a statement Tuesday. But to make sure it doesn't imprint on humans, staff train the bird's instincts onto a hand puppet that's crafted to look like a real vulture.",
      "\u201cAt this stage of development, our animal care staff are feeding the chick with the Bronx Zoo-made puppet once a day and we are working to ensure it does not imprint on humans,\" Bronx Zoo Curator of Ornithology Chuck Cerbini said in a statement.",

      "The federal lawsuit was filed against the agency and its interim head by Democratic state officials. It alleges that President Donald Trump's cost-cutting efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency illegally gutted the agency created by Congress and reneged on grants funded through the AmeriCorps State and National program, which was budgeted $557 million in congressionally approved funding this year.",

    "story": [
      "Former Memphis police officer Desmond Mills Jr. has testified that he regrets his failure to stop the beating of Tyre Nichols after Nichols ran away from a traffic stop in 2023",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Former Memphis police officer Desmond Mills Jr. testified Tuesday that he regrets his failure to stop the beating of Tyre Nichols after Nichols ran away from a traffic stop in 2023.",
      "Mills' testimony came in the second day of the trial of Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith, who have pleaded not guilty to state charges including second-degree murder in the death of Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was beaten as he cried out for his mother just steps from his home. The three defendants already face the prospect of years behind bars after they were convicted of federal charges last year.",
      "Footage of the beating was captured by a police pole camera and also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled. Nichols' death led to national protests, raised the volume on calls for police reforms in the U.S. and directed intense scrutiny toward the police force in Memphis, a majority-Black city.",
      "Mills pleaded guilty to federal charges last year and has agreed to plead guilty to state charges as well.",
      "During his testimony Tuesday, Mills said he and Bean responded to a Jan. 7, 2023, police radio call that a man had run away from a traffic stop after he was pepper-sprayed and hit with a Taser. Nichols saw the two officers and ran away from them, and Bean eventually caught Nichols after a foot chase, Mills testified.",
      "When Mills arrived at Nichols\u2019 location, Nichols was struggling with Bean and Smith, who were holding Nichols on the ground, Mills said. Mills then tried to pepper-spray Nichols, but he ended up spraying himself, which made him angry, Mills said.",
      "After stepping away to try to recover, Mills then walked up to Nichols and hit him three times in the arm with a police baton as Bean and Smith were holding Nichols, Mills said.",
      "Mills told prosecutor Paul Hagerman that he hit Nichols with the baton because he was angry. Another officer, Emmitt Martin, arrived and punched and kicked Nichols in the head.",
      "Nichols died three days after the beating. Mills acknowledged on the stand that he had a duty to intervene to stop it, but didn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cDo you regret that?\u201d the prosecutor said.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d Mills said.",
      "Mills also acknowledged that he did not tell paramedics that Nichols had been repeatedly hit in the head and later failed to give police supervisors details of the beating because he didn\u2019t want to get in trouble.",
      "Under cross-examination, Mills said Nichols was not complying with repeated orders to give officers his hands so that he could be handcuffed. Mills acknowledged that suspects present a danger to officers if they don\u2019t obey such commands.",
      "Defense attorney John Keith Perry asked Mills if he would have struck Nichols with the baton if Nichols had just put his hands behind his back. Mills said no.",
      "\u201cI would have stopped,\u201d said Mills, who spoke in a measured, quiet voice during questioning.",
      "The air conditioning was not working properly in the compact, circular, windowless and packed courtroom. At times, Perry \u2014 wearing a tie and suit jacket \u2014 wiped his head and back of the neck with what appeared to be a handkerchief or a small towel, and people periodically fanned themselves with pieces of paper.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hot in here,\u201d Perry said.",
      "Under the plea agreements, Mills\u2019 state sentence will be the same length as his federal term, which could reach up to life in prison, though federal prosecutors have recommended a 15-year sentence. He would serve the state sentence at the same time as his federal term in prison.",
      "In opening statements Monday, prosecutor Paul Hagerman said Nichols was being held by his arms by two of the officers as he was punched and kicked and hit with a police baton.",
      "Hagerman said the officers helped each other beat Nichols to death. An autopsy showed Nichols died three days after the beating of blunt force trauma.",
      "He said the officers had a duty to stop the beating but none of them did so. They were \u201covercome by the moment,\u201d the prosecutor said.",
      "In his opening statement, Bean\u2019s attorney said the situation became \u201chigh risk\u201d when Nichols continued driving for about 2 miles (3.2 km) after one of the officers turned on his vehicle\u2019s blue lights in an attempt to stop Nichols for speeding. Nichols then failed to follow orders to give officers his hands so that he could be handcuffed, Perry said.",
      "\u201cHe was actually resisting arrest the whole time,\u201d Perry said, adding that the officers just \u201cwanted to do their job effectively.\u201d",
      "Both Smith and Haley called for medical aid the night of the beating, their lawyers said.",
      "The jury for the state trial was chosen in Hamilton County, which includes Chattanooga, after Judge James Jones Jr. ordered the case be heard from people outside of Shelby County, which includes Memphis. Defense lawyers for the officers had argued that intense publicity made seating a fair jury difficult.",
      "The officers are charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.",
      "Mills and Martin were also charged but will not stand trial with their former colleagues due to their agreements to testify. Sentencings for all five officers in the federal case is expected after the state trial.",
      "In December, the U.S. Justice Department said a 17-month investigation showed the Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.",

      "A former high school athletics director accused of using artificial intelligence to create a racist and antisemitic deepfake of a Maryland principal has been sentenced to four months in jail as part of a plea deal for disturbing school operations",
      "BALTIMORE -- A former high school athletics director accused of using artificial intelligence to create a racist and antisemitic deepfake of a Maryland principal has been sentenced to four months in jail as part of a plea deal for disrupting school operations.",
      "Dazhon Darien, 32, accepted the deal Monday in Baltimore County Circuit Court, records show. He entered an Alford plea to the single misdemeanor charge, which means he acknowledged the evidence against him without directly admitting guilt. His original charges included theft, stalking and retaliating against a witness.",
      "According to police and prosecutors, Darien used AI software to generate a fake recording of former Pikesville High School principal Eric Eiswert\u2019s voice expressing frustration with Black students and their test-taking abilities. The recording, which was disseminated throughout the school community and shared widely on social media last January, also purported to capture the principal disparaging Jewish people, authorities said.",
      "Not long before the recording surfaced, Eiswert had informed Darien that his contract wouldn\u2019t be renewed the following semester because of concerns over poor job performance, according to court documents. The concerns included allegations that Darien paid his roommate $1,900 in school funds under the pretense of coaching the girls\u2019 soccer team, police said.",
      "Experts who analyzed the recording concluded it was AI-generated.",
      "Despite receiving a relatively short sentence, Darien could remain incarcerated longer as he faces a separate federal case in which he\u2019s accused of sexual exploitation of children and possession of child sexual abuse material. Authorities said they discovered evidence of those crimes while searching Darien\u2019s phone and other devices.",
      "While fake recordings of political figures and celebrities have surfaced in recent years as the technology becomes more widespread, officials have said the case is among the first examples of AI being used to embarrass someone for personal gain.",
      "The subset of artificial intelligence known as generative AI can create hyperrealistic images, videos and audio clips. As it becomes cheaper and easier to use, anyone with an internet connection can access its capabilities. Even a short recording of someone\u2019s voice allows users to generate cloned speech from a script.",
      "Other examples of AI-generated audio include robocalls impersonating former President Joe Biden that tried to dissuade Democrats from voting in last year\u2019s New Hampshire primary election. People have also cloned the voices of purportedly kidnapped children over the phone to get ransom money from parents, experts say.",
      "In response, many states have enacted laws in recent years targeting the use of AI, especially targeting media intended to influence election results and digitally created or altered child sexual abuse imagery.",
      "During this year\u2019s legislative session, Maryland lawmakers considered a bill that would have prohibited the use of AI to falsely impersonate people. Baltimore County State\u2019s Attorney Scott Shellenberger advocated in favor of the law change, but it ultimately didn\u2019t pass.",
      "Darien\u2019s bogus audio sent shockwaves through the suburban Pikesville community as angry phone calls inundated the school and hate-filled messages accumulated on social media. Authorities said police were sent to patrol Eiswert\u2019s home in response to threats.",
      "Eiswert, who is now principal of another Baltimore County school, said from the beginning that he believed the recording was fake. He has since filed a lawsuit against the school district, alleging Darien never should have been hired in the first place.",
      "Darien joined the district in spring 2023, when he started teaching social studies at a different high school, according to the lawsuit. He was later promoted to Pikesville athletic director.",
      "Eiswert\u2019s complaint cites reporting from The Baltimore Banner that revealed a host of false claims on Darien\u2019s job application, including multiple degrees he hadn\u2019t obtained. Florida education officials also denied Darien a teaching certificate in 2016 based on \u201ctest of document fraud\u201d and flagged his name in a national database, the Banner found. Eiswert argues Baltimore County school officials failed to properly vet his application materials and investigate his background.",

      "Ukraine's European allies view the war as fundamental to the continent's security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily \u2014 regardless of whether Trump pulls out.",
      "Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of prolonging the \u201ckilling field\u201d by pushing back on his demand that Ukraine hand over occupied Crimea to Moscow.",
      "Trump\u2019s land-for-peace plan would mark a significant shift in the post-World War II order, ripping up conventions that have long held that borders should not be redrawn by force.",
      "\u201cIt took a World War to roll back de jure annexations and 60 million people died,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Heisbourg, special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris, referring to the pre-war annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany.",
      "\u201cEuropeans will not accept it\" and Ukraine will not either, he said.",
      "Diplomats and experts described various scenarios if the U.S. decides to walk. They range from the U.S. ceasing direct aid to Ukraine \u2014 but allowing European nations to pass on critical American intelligence and weapons to Kyiv \u2014 to Trump banning transfers of any American technology, including components or software in European weapons.",
      "Any withdrawal of U.S. military aid to Ukraine could create serious difficulties for Europe, analysts and diplomats told The Associated Press. Kyiv's ability to keep fighting would depend on European political will to muster money and weapons \u2014 and how quickly the gaps left by Washington can be filled.",
      "If it were easy, Europe would \u201calready be doing things without America,\u201d said a European diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter.",
      "No new U.S. aid package for Ukraine has been approved since Trump came into office, even as European nations have collectively provided Ukraine with more aid than Washington, according to the Keil Institute.",
      "Europe has contributed around $157 billion, some $26 billion more than the U.S., although Washington slightly outpaces Europe when it comes to military aid, the Germany-based institute said.",
      "It will be hard, but there are ways Europe can find cash to fund Ukraine \u2014 including seizing frozen Russian assets \u2014 but \u201cmoney isn't what you shoot bullets with,\u201d Heisbourg said.",
      "Europe\u2019s \"big mistake\" was undertaking major military downsizing following the Cold War and thinking \u201cthis war started in February 2022 and not in February 2014,\u201d when Moscow invaded and then annexed Crimea, said Thomas Gomart, director of IFRI, a French international affairs think tank.",
      "Europeans are scrambling to acquire weapons for themselves and for Ukraine, while confronting constraints on production capacity, a fragmented defense industry and a decades-long reliance on the U.S.",
      "Some extra production capacity could come from Ukraine, which has ramped up manufacturing of ammunition and drones since Russia's invasion. Much harder to replace, experts said, are advanced American weapons, including air defenses.",
      "Russia has attacked Ukraine almost nightly since Putin\u2019s forces invaded in February 2022, flooding the skies with missiles and drones, including dummy attack drones to exhaust Ukraine's limited air defenses. In April, at least 57 people were killed in multiple strikes.",
      "The death toll from the Russian attacks would \u201cinevitably\u201d be higher without the American Patriot air-defense missile systems protecting Ukraine's skies, said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "The Patriots can track and intercept Russian missiles, including the hypersonic Kinzhal, which Putin has boasted was unstoppable. Kyiv uses them to protect critical infrastructure, including the country's energy grid.",
      "Earlier this month, Zelenskyy asked to buy 10 Patriots, a request Trump dismissed. \u201cYou don\u2019t start a war against someone 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles,\" he said, a day after a Russian strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy killed 35 people.",
      "France and Italy have given Ukraine their Aster SAMP/T air-defense system but the issue is not \u201cquality, it\u2019s quantity,\u201d Barrie said, pointing to the larger U.S. defense industrial base and greater U.S. stockpiles.",
      "Although Trump criticized Putin over the weekend for his missile strikes and suggested imposing more sanctions on Russia, for Europe it remains a wait-and-see game.",
      "The whiplash of Trump's aggressive foreign policy means nothing is off the cards, experts said.",
      "A worst-case scenario could see a ban on American weapons exports and transfers to Ukraine, which would bar European nations from buying U.S. weapons to give to Kyiv or transferring weapons with American components or software, Barrie said.",
      "That could mean countries, including Germany, that have already given American Patriots to Ukraine would be prohibited from doing so. Such a move would seriously hamper Europe's ability to support Kyiv and mark a fundamental shift in America's relationship with its allies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for the U.S. to cease to be an ally, it is another for the U.S. to be an enemy,\u201d Heisbourg said, noting that such a step could also damage the U.S. defense sector if weapons purchases were perceived to be unusable on Trump\u2019s political order.",
      "In March, the Trump administration suspended intelligence sharing with Ukraine in a bid to force Zelenskyy to accept a truce with Russia. The about weeklong suspension impacted Ukraine's ability to track and target Russian troops, tanks and ships.",
      "There are certain capabilities, including \u201chigher-end\u201d surveillance and reconnaissance using satellites that \u201conly the United States can provide,\u201d said Matthew Kroenig, vice president of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security in Washington.",
      "While the extent of intelligence sharing between the U.S. and Ukraine is not known, experts said it likely shows Kyiv near real-time buildup of Russian troop deployments and helps target long-range strikes.",
      "Ukraine's allies do not have as much satellite capability as the U.S. but could launch more, or Ukraine could use commercial systems if Trump cuts off intelligence again, experts said. The latter would likely have to come from a European provider \u2014 in March, the American satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies confirmed it temporarily suspended access to unclassified satellite images following the administration's decision to pull intelligence sharing.",
      "Ukraine also needs an alternative to Elon Musk's satellite network Starlink, which is critical for Ukrainian defensive and civilian communications. European defense companies are discussing creating a satellite alliance but don't currently have an alternative on the same scale.",
      "If Trump walks away, or if Kyiv rejects a deal and keeps fighting with European support, it won\u2019t necessarily mean \"the collapse of Ukraine\" although more people will almost certainly die if the U.S. pulls its air defenses and intelligence-sharing capabilities, Heisbourg said.",
      "Trump has jolted European leaders into awareness that they need to take responsibility for their own defense, regardless of who occupies the White House, experts said.",
      "That means European nations need to invest more in defense, work together to scale up military production and build trust to share intelligence.",
      "\u201cThis issue is not a question about the next two months or the next two years. This issue is about the next two decades,\u201d Gomart said.",

      "New York state lawmakers have agreed on a proposal to ban cellphones in public schools beginning in the next school year",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York state would ban cellphones in public schools \u201cbell to bell\u201d beginning with the next school year under an agreement announced late Monday by Gov. Kathy Hochul.",
      "\u201cWe've protected our kids before from cigarettes, alcohol, and drunk driving, and now we're protecting them from addictive technology designed to hijack their attention,\u201d Hochul said in announcing the plan as part of a tentative budget agreement with state lawmakers.",
      "Hochul, a Democrat, did not immediately detail plans for the ban. Her office has previously said that schools would have some flexibility over how to implement it, with districts deciding how to store students\u2019 devices during the school day. There would be exemptions for students who need access for medical reasons, to help with learning disabilities or because they don\u2019t speak fluent English, she has said.",
      "If approved, New York would join at least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 that have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools. Nationally, most schools say they prohibit cellphone use except for academic purposes, but educators say the rules are difficult to enforce when students are allowed to have the devices in hallways and at lunch.",
      "\u201cBell-to-bell\u201d bans like the one Hochul described are meant to remove the distraction altogether by restricting access during school hours, often over the objection of parents who say they want to be able to reach their kids during emergency situations.",
      "New York City, which has the largest school district in the country, last year abandoned discussions for a cellphone ban because of parent concerns.",
      "Lawmakers are expected to begin voting on the $254 billion state budget this week.",

      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Consumers across the U.S. still will be able to buy higher-ethanol blend E15 gasoline this summer, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday, saving them a little money at the pump but risking potential damage to the air and water.",
      "The emergency waiver issued by the EPA prevents retailers in most states from having to stop selling E15 gasoline on May 1. While the waiver remains in effect only through May 20, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin signaled that he plans to keep issuing waivers through Sept. 15, the date when the federal government typically would allow E15 sales in all states again.",
      "Most gasoline sold across the U.S. is blended with 10% ethanol, but 15% blends are becoming increasingly common, particularly in the Midwest, where most of the nation's corn is grown. E15 gasoline generally costs at least 10 cents less a gallon than E10 gasoline, but the EPA had previously prohibited its sale during the summer over concerns that its use during the summer driving season could increase smog.",
      "But the EPA has relaxed restrictions on E15, granting a series of short-term waivers in 2022, 2023 and 2024 to allow its sale nationwide through the summer. And last year, the EPA issued a rule allowing year-round sales in eight Midwestern states \u2014 Iowa, usually the nation's top corn producer, as well as Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump administration officials said Monday's action will lower consumers' costs and give them more choices at the pump while also increasing the demand for corn. They also described it as reducing America's reliance on imported energy.",
      "\u201cOur nation\u2019s great corn growers are critical to helping the U.S. achieve energy independence, which is essential to national security,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement.",
      "While the ethanol industry and Iowa officials praised the EPA's action, the Renewable Fuels Association, a trade group for ethanol producers, argued that Congress should approve legislation allowing year-round E15 sales across the U.S.",
      "\u201cFor the economic and energy security benefits of E15 to be fully realized, the marketplace needs long-term certainty,\u201d President and CEO Geoff Cooper said.",
      "The biofuels industry and politicians in both major parties argue that ethanol helps farmers, lowers prices at the pump and reduces greenhouse gas because the fuel burns more cleanly than straight gasoline.",
      "But ethanol consumes about 40% of the nation's corn crop, and environmentalists argue that higher corn production leads to higher use of fertilizers that are a leading source of water pollution.",
      "Zack Pistora, Kansas lobbyist for the Sierra Club, said ethanol plants also use high amounts of water, and states like Kansas are worried about the depletion of aquifers. He said it's \u201chypocritical\u201d to portray ethanol as environmentally friendly and said the Trump administration should promote renewable energy, electric vehicles, public transportation and sustainable agriculture.",
      "\u201cWe need to dramatically reduce our fossil fuel dependence, but relying on corn-based ethanol doesn\u2019t put our country on the path it needs,\u201d Pistora said in an interview.",

      "A historic Black church in downtown Memphis that was the organizing point for Martin Luther King Jr.'s final stand has suffered a devastating fire",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A historic Black church in downtown Memphis that was the organizing point for Martin Luther King Jr.'s final campaign in 1968 caught fire early Monday morning and suffered significant damage.",
      "\u201cThe inside is a total loss, but we're still somewhat hopeful that some of the facade will be able to be left standing,\u201d Memphis Fire Chief Gina Sweat said at a Monday morning news conference. She said the fire was reported at 1:39 a.m. through a commercial alarm service. Local fire and police officers are investigating the cause, along with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It is \u201cway too early\u201d to know anything more, Sweat said. King was drawn to Memphis in 1968 to support some 1,300 predominantly Black sanitation workers who went on strike to protest inhumane treatment. Two workers had been crushed in a garbage compactor in 1964, but the faulty equipment had not been replaced. On Feb. 1, 1968, two more men, Echol Cole, 36, and Robert Walker, 30, were crushed in the compactor. The two men were contract workers, so they did not qualify for workmen\u2019s compensation, and had no life insurance.",
      "Workers wanted to unionize, and fought for higher pay and safer working conditions. City officials declared the strike illegal and arrested scores of strikers and protesters.",
      "Before the fire, the Clayborn Temple was undergoing a $25 million restoration that was slated for completion in 2026. The initiative aims to preserve the architectural and historical integrity of the Romanesque revival church and includes the restoration of a 3,000-pipe grand organ. At the same time, the project seeks to help revitalize the local neighborhood with a museum, cultural programing and community outreach, according to a news release on the renovation.",
      "\u201cThis morning we woke up to heartbreaking news: a devastating fire has ravaged one of our city\u2019s greatest treasures, Clayborn Temple,\u201d Memphis Mayor Paul Young wrote in a statement posted to social media. \u201cClayborn is more than a historic building. It is sacred ground. It is the beating heart of the civil rights movement, a symbol of struggle, hope, and triumph that belongs not just to Memphis but to the world.\u201d",
      "Just south of Beale Street, Clayborn Temple was built in 1892 as the Second Presbyterian Church and originally served an all-white congregation. In 1949, the building was sold to an African Methodist Episcopal congregation and renamed Clayborn Temple, according to the release.",
      "Memphis sanitation workers started striking in February 1968 after Cole and Walker were killed on the job.",
      "The Clayborn Temple hosted nightly meetings and the campaign\u2019s iconic \u201cI AM A MAN\u201d posters were made in its basement. The temple was also a staging point for marches to City Hall. They included a March 28, 1968, march led by King, a rally that turned violent when police and protesters clashed on the iconic Beale Street, and a 16-year-old was killed.",
      "When marchers retreated to the temple, police fired tear gas inside. People broke some of the stained-glass windows to escape. King promised to lead a second, peaceful march in Memphis, but he was killed by a sniper while standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel on April 4.",
      "After King was assassinated and the strike ended with the workers securing a pay raise, the church\u2019s influence waned. It fell into disrepair and was vacant for years before the renovation effort that took off in 2017 thanks to a $400,000 grant from the National Park Service.",
      "Clayborn Temple was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.",
      "Jimmie Tucker, one of the architects who has been working on the restoration for years, said Monday that he spent the morning working on a plan to try to shore up the exterior walls. He had been speaking to some of the people who helped after a similar Memphis fire at First United Methodist Church in 2006. He said that project gives him hope because they were able to rebuild.",
      "\u201cAs a native Memphian, this project is personal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has so much meaning.\u201d",
      "Young pledged that the city will \u201chelp ensure this sacred place rises again.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Wis. -- Prosecutors have reduced a felony misconduct charge against a former Wisconsin prison warden implicated in two inmate deaths to a misdemeanor as part of a plea deal, online court records indicated Monday.",
      "Hepp was charged with felony misconduct in office in June 2024 in the deaths of Cameron Williams and Donald Maier at the Waupun Correctional Institution, the state's oldest maximum security facility. He announced his retirement days before he was charged.",
      "Online court records show prosecutors reduced the misconduct charge Monday to violating state-county institution laws. The misconduct charge carried a maximum sentence of three-and-a-half years in prison and $10,000 in fines. The violation count is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail and $500 in fines.",
      "Hepp was due to appear in Dodge County Circuit Court on Monday afternoon for a joint plea-sentencing hearing. Online records show a plea agreement was filed Monday morning and Hepp was given a guilty plea questionnaire, a form that asks defendants if they knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty.",
      "Hepp's attorney, Michael Steinle, did not return a message from The Associated Press on Monday morning.",
      "Eight members of Hepp's staff were charged in June with abuse or misconduct in the deaths. Online court records show charges were dismissed against one of them this month and another pleaded guilty in September to a reduced count of misdemeanor violating laws governing a penal institution and was assessed a $250 fine. Cases are pending against the remaining six staffers.",
      "Williams died of a stroke at the prison in October 2023. His body was not discovered for at least 12 hours. Maier died of dehydration and malnutrition in February 2024.",
      "According to court documents, Williams told an inmate advocate three days before he died that he needed to go to a hospital but no action was taken. He had fallen in the shower two days earlier and had to crawl into his cell. A day before that he collapsed on the way back to his cell but neither fall was documented. No one checked on him the night he died.",
      "Maier had severe mental health problems but either refused or wasn't given his medication in the eight days leading up to his death, according to court documents. Another inmate told investigators guards turned off Maier's water after he flooded his cell. Guards said they turned water off and on for Maier, but investigators said no one told him when it was on and no one gave him food in the four days before his death.",
      "Asked if prison workers understand the water shut-off policy, Hepp told investigators that policies go out via email but he doesn't think anyone at any prison reads them. He said no American jail documents an inmate's every meal.",
      "The prison, with a stone exterior and high, castle-like guard towers, opened in 1854 and has long been a target for closure. Seven inmates, including Williams and Maier, have died there since 2023. One killed himself, one died of a fentanyl overdose and one died of what investigators suspect was suicide. Two more deaths are under investigation.",
      "A federal investigation into smuggling at the prison has so far netted at least one former employee who pleaded guilty to smuggling cellphones and drugs in exchange for money. Inmates have filed a class-action lawsuit alleging inhumane conditions and a lack of health care.",
      "Democratic Gov. Tony Evers has rejected calls to shutter the facility, despite the problems. He has said he wants broader criminal justice reform and a plan to house the facility's roughly 1,700 inmates.",

      "Schoolchildren threatened with eviction are more likely to end up in another district or transfer to another school",
      "HOUSTON -- Since her birth 10 years ago, Mackenzie Holmes has rarely called one place home for long.",
      "There was the house in Houston owned by her grandmother, Crystal Holmes. Then, after Holmes lost her Southwest Airlines job and the house, there was the trio of apartments in the suburbs \u2014 and three evictions. Then another rental, and another eviction. Then motels and her uncle's one-bedroom apartment, where Mackenzie and her grandmother slept on an inflatable mattress. Finally, Crystal Holmes secured a spot in a women's shelter, so the two would no longer have to sleep on the floor.",
      "With nearly every move came a new school, a new set of classmates, and new lessons to catch up on. Mackenzie only has one friend she\u2019s known longer than a year, and she didn't receive testing or a diagnosis for dyslexia until this year. She would often miss long stretches of class in between schools.",
      "Schoolchildren threatened with eviction are more likely to end up in another district or transfer to another school, often one with less funding, more poverty and lower test scores. They're more likely to miss school, and those who end up transferring are suspended more often. That's according to an analysis from the Eviction Lab at Princeton University, published in Sociology of Education, a peer-reviewed journal, and shared exclusively with The Associated Press' Education Reporting Network.",
      "Pairing court filings and student records from the Houston Independent School District, where Mackenzie started kindergarten, researchers identified more than 18,000 times between 2002 and 2016 when students lived in homes threatened with eviction filings. They found students facing eviction were absent more often. Even when they didn\u2019t have to change schools, students threatened with eviction missed four more days in the following school year than their peers.",
      "In all, researchers counted 13,197 children between 2002 and 2016 whose parents faced an eviction filing. A quarter of those children faced repeated evictions.",
      "As eviction rates in Houston continue to worsen, there might be more children like Mackenzie.",
      "Neveah Barahona, a 17-year-old big sister to seven siblings, started kindergarten in Houston, but has moved schools half a dozen times. Her mother, Roxanne Abarca, knew moving can be disruptive. So whenever she fell behind on rent and the family was forced to move, she tried to let them finish the school year \u2013 even if it meant driving them great distances.",
      "Neveah, a strong student who hopes to join the military, said the moves took a toll.",
      "\u201cIt is kind of draining, meeting new people, meeting new teachers, getting on track with ... what they want to teach you and what you used to know,\u201d Neveah said. Then there's finding her way with new classmates. A spate of bullying this year left her despondent until she got counseling.",
      "Households with children are about twice as likely to face eviction than those without children, Eviction Lab research has shown. That's 1.5 million children getting evicted every year \u2014 and one in 20 children under 5 living in a rental home. Still, much of the discourse focuses on adults \u2014 the landlords and grown-up tenants \u2014 rather than the kids caught in the middle, said Peter Hepburn, the study's lead author.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s \u2026 worth reminding people that 40% of the people at risk of losing their homes through the eviction process are kids,\u201d said Hepburn, a sociology professor at Rutgers University-Newark and associate director at the Eviction Lab.",
      "Households often become more vulnerable to eviction because they fall behind when they have children. Only 5% of low-wage earners, who are especially vulnerable to housing instability, have access to paid parental leave.",
      "Under a federal law that protects homeless students, districts are supposed to try to keep children in the same school if they lose their housing midyear, providing daily transportation. But children who are evicted don't always qualify for those services. Even those who do often fall through the cracks, because schools don't know why children are leaving or where they're headed.",
      "In the sprawl of Houston, it can be especially challenging for transient students to stay on track. The metropolis bleeds seamlessly from the city limits to unincorporated parts of Harris County, which is divided into 24 other districts. It\u2019s easy to leave Houston's school district without realizing it. And despite the best efforts of parents and caretakers, kids can miss a lot of school in transition.",
      "That's what happened in January, when Mackenzie's grandmother, then staying in her son's one-bedroom apartment with her granddaughter, got desperate.

      "A former supervisor of the team that prosecuted the 1,500 plus people charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol says he fears President Donald Trump's pardons could embolden right-wing extremists and encourage future political violence",
      "WASHINGTON -- Michael Romano spent more than 17 years at the Justice Department, eventually becoming a supervisor on the team that would prosecute more than 1,500 people charged in the attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "The moment he watched the largest investigation in department history get wiped away with the stroke of a pen \u2014 on President Donald Trump's first day back in the White House \u2014 Romano knew he had to leave.",
      "\u201cI knew on January 20th, when the pardons were announced, that I needed to find my way out,\" Romano said in an interview with The Associated Press weeks after his resignation from the Justice Department. \u201cIt would be untenable for me to stay, given the pardons and given the false narratives that were being spread about January 6.\"",
      "Now, Romano says he fears Trump\u2019s decision to pardon even the most violent rioters \u2014 whom his own vice president once said \u201cobviously\u201d shouldn\u2019t be pardoned \u2014 could embolden right-wing extremists and encourage future political violence.",
      "\u201cThe way that the pardons have been received by the January 6th defendants and by other right-wing extremists, as I understand it, is to recognize that if you support the president and if you commit violence in support of the president, that he might insulate you from the consequences, that he might protect you from the criminal justice system,\u201d Romano said. \u201cAnd so that might encourage people to commit these sort of acts.\u201d",
      "Romano is among dozens of Justice Department lawyers who have resigned, been pushed out or fired in the weeks since Trump's new leadership has taken over and begun making sweeping changes to align the law enforcement agency with the priorities of the Republican president whom the department once prosecuted.",
      "Trump's return to the White House has ushered in a dizzying change for many in the Justice Department, but perhaps few have felt it more than the lawyers who spent years working on the largest-scale serious attack on the Capitol since the war of 1812.",
      "As a deputy chief of the now-disbanded Capitol Siege Section that prosecuted the Jan. 6, 2021, riot, Romano had a close-up view of the evidence, including harrowing videos and court testimony detailing the violence that unfolded when the pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify former President Joe Biden's 2020 victory.",
      "Romano joined the Justice Department in 2007 straight out of law school, and was working in the section in Washington that handles public corruption cases on Jan. 6, 2021. He recalled watching the riot unfold on television, and quickly deciding he wanted to help with the prosecution of what he described as a \u201ccrime of historic proportions.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s pardons cemented the president's yearslong campaign to rewrite the history of the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "While vying to return to the White House, Trump repeatedly downplayed the violence that left more than 100 police officers injured, and lauded the rioters as patriots and hostages whom he contended were unfairly persecuted by the Justice Department for their political beliefs. Only two Capitol riot defendants were acquitted of all charges, which Trump supporters cited as evidence that Washington juries can\u2019t be fair and impartial. Some Jan. 6 defendants are now considering running for office.",
      "The scope of Trump's clemency hours after the inauguration came as a surprise to many, considering the president had suggested in the weeks prior that instead of blanket pardons, he would look at the Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis. Trump's proclamation described the prosecution as \u201ca grave national injustice\" and declared that the pardons would begin \u201ca process of national reconciliation.\u201d",
      "Trump's pardons led to the release from prison of the leaders of far-right extremist groups convicted of orchestrating violent plots to stop the peaceful transfer of power as well as rioters convicted of brutal attacks on police \u2014 many of whose crimes were captured on camera and broadcast on live TV. Trump has defended his pardons, saying the sentences handed down for actions that day were \u201cridiculous and excessive\" and that \u201cthese are people who actually love our country.\u201d",
      "Romano said the notion that the Jan. 6 defendants were not treated fairly by in the justice system or not given the due process they were entitled is \u201csimply not true.\u201d In many cases, he said prosecutors had overwhelming evidence because the defendants \u201cfilmed themselves proudly committing crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey had the full protection of rights guaranteed to them by the American justice system and the Constitution,\" Romano said. \u201cIt was my experience when dealing with these cases and seeing the way that the rioters and some of their attorneys behaved in court, that their take was that they should be treated like heroes and not prosecuted at all.\u201d",
      "Despite the pardons, Romano said he still believes that the Capitol Siege Section's work was important because it left behind a \u201chistorical record\u201d of what happened on Jan. 6 that cannot be changed.",
      "\u201cIn light of the efforts to whitewash the history of that day, in light of the efforts for people to lie about that day for their own benefit, which is what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s important that people really understand the truth about what happened on January 6th,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to complain about the plan, which the company said had been rejected.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after it was reported that the retail giant planned to detail the cost of trade tariffs to its customers.",
      "Amazon said it had looked into itemising the impact for shoppers using Amazon Haul, a low-cost site it launched in the US last year to compete with Shein and Temu.",
      "But it said it had decided not to move forward and the idea had never been under consideration for its main platform.",
      "The White House decision to go on the attack over the report is an indication of the pressure it is facing over its new import taxes, which analysts say will lead to higher prices for consumers and increase the chances of a recession.",
      "At a news conference marking the president's first 100 days in office on Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she had discussed Amazon's reported move with the president and argued it represented \"another reason why Americans should buy American\".",
      "\"This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,\" she said. \"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\"",
      "Trump has ramped up tariffs since re-entering office in January, measures he argues will boost manufacturing and raise tax revenue for the US.",
      "Even after rolling back some of his initial plans this month, Trump's announcements have left many foreign imports facing new duties of at least 10%, while products from China are facing import taxes of at least 145%.",
      "The measures have prompted a sharp drop in trade between the two countries, and raised fears of supply shocks and shortages of products from baby prams to umbrellas, items for which China is a major supplier.",
      "Some businesses are starting to detail the costs of the measures for customers, with Shein and Temu, known for business models that ship directly from Chinese manufacturers to customers, among the online platforms to already announce price hikes.",
      "Merchants from China represent about half of the sellers on Amazon in the US, according to analysts.",
      "Amazon's plan to detail the tariff impact for customers was first reported by Punchbowl News on Tuesday, citing an anonymous source.",
      "Asked about the report, Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle confirmed that the company had considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products for its Amazon Haul store.",
      "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" he said in a statement to the BBC.",
      "A source familiar with the Amazon discussions said they had been sparked by the end of the exemption from tariffs for shipments from China worth less than $800.",
      "The person said the decision not to spotlight the new costs was not a response to the White House complaints on Tuesday.",
      "But asked by reporters about his call with Mr Bezos, Trump said the billionaire, who stepped down as chief executive in 2021, had \"solved the problem\".",
      "\"Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. He did the right thing. He's a good guy,\" he said.",
      "Amazon was among the many businesses to donate money to the president's inauguration and Mr Bezos was given a seat of honour at the event.",
      "Mr Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, met Trump after the election and has praised his push for deregulation and lower taxes.",
      "But the two men have had a tense relationship in the past.",
      "Trump repeatedly criticised Amazon and the Washington Post during his first term, while Mr Bezos in 2016 accused Trump of using rhetoric that \"erodes our democracy around the edges\" and once joked about blasting him to space in a rocket.",
      "In 2019, Amazon filed a lawsuit against the Pentagon, alleging that it had been denied a $10bn contract due to Trump's decision to \"pursue his own personal and political ends\" to harm Mr Bezos, \"his perceived political enemy\".",

    "story": [
      "On a searing afternoon in Vietnam, Tung Linh declared she \"basically knows nothing\" about the bloody, decades-long war that pitted her country's Communist-run North against the United States-backed South.",
      "\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.",
      "Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, the capital, Ho Chi Minh, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.",
      "Today's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.",
      "Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.",
      "But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.",
      "Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.",
      "But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).",
      "\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.",
      "It's a dream that suits the bustling she city she lives in \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, the Vietnamese capital has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.",
      "You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.",
      "And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.",
      "America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.",
      "The victory had come at enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",
      "Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.",
      "\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.",
      "Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.",
      "A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"",
      "When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.",
      "\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"",
      "Vietnam's new leaders appears to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.",
      "The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.",
      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",
      "After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.",
      "\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.",
      "\"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\"",
      "It's no coincidence this shift began around 2017, when Trump declared his first trade war against China.",
      "Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"",
      "They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",
      "Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"",
      "Vietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big communist neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.",
      "As Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.",
      "But even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.",
      "\"There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.\"",
      "But he says he bears no anger anymore.",
      "\"We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.\"",

    "summary": "Documents show Doug Barrowman-linked company owned the prince's start-up competition for two years.",
    "story": [
      "One of Prince Andrew's prized business assets was administered for two years by a company controlled by the controversial millionaire Doug Barrowman, the BBC can reveal.",
      "After the prince's disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, legal ownership of his Dragons' Den-style start-up competition, Pitch@Palace Global, was transferred to a Barrowman-linked firm, Knox House Trustees (UK).",
      "Barrowman and his wife, lingerie boss Baroness Michelle Mone, hit the headlines when she admitted they had lied about their links to a company that won large government contracts during the Covid pandemic after she recommended it to ministers.",
      "A lawyer for Mr Barrowman said he \"at no time... had any business or personal involvement with the duke\".",
      "Pitch@Palace Global remained the prince's company, under his control. But in line with longstanding royal practice, it was owned under the names of other people or companies, acting on his behalf as so-called \"nominees\".",
      "Documents filed at Companies House show that from 2021, the nominee owner was Knox House Trustees (UK), which was controlled and ultimately owned by Mr Barrowman until 2023.",
      "Controversial associates",
      "Prince Andrew's finances have been under intense scrutiny, with questions about how he can afford to live in his Royal Lodge mansion in Windsor after he was cut off financially by his brother, King Charles.",
      "The prince's choice of business associates has long been controversial. In December, he said he \"ceased all contact\" with Yang Tengbo, who led the Chinese arm of Pitch@Palace, after receiving advice from the UK government which alleged that he was a spy.",
      "Mr Yang has denied being a spy or doing anything unlawful.",
      "Mr Barrowman has attracted plenty of controversy too. In 2017, HMRC began an investigation into one of his companies, AML Tax (UK), which it said \"aggressively promoted\" tax avoidance schemes. It was fined \u00a3150,000 in 2022.",
      "In January that year, the Guardian newspaper first reported links between Mr Barrowman, Baroness Mone and PPE Medpro. The pair denied involvement until December 2023, when she admitted in a BBC interview that they had lied about their links with the company.",
      "The National Crime Agency is now investigating suspected criminal offences at the firm. Mr Barrowman and Baroness Mone both deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Author Andrew Lownie, who is writing a biography of the prince, said: \"Andrew has a long history of associating with dubious business figures and disguising his business activities behind nominee and offshore accounts. There really needs to be a full investigation into the duke's financial activities.\"",
      "Who owns Pitch@Palace?",
      "Pitch@Palace was a start-up competition, founded in 2014, where entrepreneurs would pitch their ideas to possible investors in the hope of winning their backing. It had two parts:",
      "a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholdersan international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company",
      "a UK-based version, set up as a community interest company, which cannot pay profits to shareholders",
      "an international arm, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd, which held competitions in places such as Australia, Bahrain and China, and was set up as a for-profit UK company",
      "Both arms of Pitch@Palace suspended operations following the Newsnight interview in 2019 about the prince's links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which led to Andrew stepping down as a working royal.",
      "Nonetheless, the international operation has emerged as a possible way for the duke to fund his lifestyle. In a court witness statement from 2023, Mr Yang wrote that the duke had needed money \"and saw the relationships with China through Pitch as one possible source of funding\".",
      "Earlier this year a Dutch company said it was in talks to buy it, saying it saw \"immense value\" in the network, even though it had suspended operations.",
      "However, Prince Andrew has never held the company in his own name.",
      "Founded in 2017, Pitch@Palace Global Ltd was initially held in the name of Amanda Thirsk, the prince's private secretary, in an arrangement often used by the Royal Family.",
      "But early in 2021, the legal ownership was transferred to Knox House Trustees (UK) Limited.",
      "This company had been set up the year before, and Mr Barrowman was named as having \"significant influence and control\" over it.",
      "Corporate filings in the Isle of Man show Knox House Trustees (UK) was ultimately owned by Knox Limited, whose sole shareholder is Mr Barrowman.",
      "Investigations into Barrowman's companies",
      "In 2023, ownership of Knox House Trustees (UK) Ltd \u2013 which still owned Pitch@Palace Global - was transferred to Arthur Lancaster, an accountant who has a longstanding working relationship with both the prince and Mr Barrowman. This remains the situation today.",
      "The same year Mr Lancaster took over as the sole director and shareholder of PPE Medpro. He was also a director of many of the companies involved in the AML tax avoidance case.",
      "The judge in that case called him \"evasive\" and said he had \"real concerns as to the reliability of Mr Lancaster's evidence\", which contained \"significant inconsistencies\".",
      "After the case, his lawyer wrote to the court arguing that the conclusions were \"unnecessarily harsh\", that Mr Lancaster had been a \"diligent and truthful witness\", and that his efforts to provide information had been hampered by the Covid pandemic.",
      "For decades the Royal Family has held investments through nominees, and still does. In the past this has served to keep details of their holdings private, though not in this case. Prince Andrew's involvement in Pitch@Palace Global is well known, and he is listed as having \"significant influence or control\" over the company on Companies House.",
      "Mr Barrowman's lawyer said in a statement: \"Mr Lancaster was a director of KHT (UK) Ltd which provided company administration services to a number of external companies, including Pitch@Palace, a company wholly owned by the duke. Mr Lancaster acted for the duke in a personal capacity at all times and has been an associate of the duke for many years.\"",
      "Mr Lancaster declined to comment. Prince Andrew did not respond to requests for comment."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70zy5w983go",
    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:41:25 GMT",
    "summary": "The president said the move would give companies relief while they adjust their supply chains.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has taken action to ease the impact of new tariffs on the car making industry, which had sparked warnings about higher prices and the potential for significant hits to sales and production.",
      "The change will allow companies with US factories to reduce the amount they pay in import taxes on foreign parts, using a formula tied to how many cars they sell and the price.",
      "The provision is intended to provide relief to businesses for two years as they rework their supply chains, the White House said.",
      "Officials also moved to shield car firms from facing mounting tariffs on the same items.",
      "They said businesses that have to pay tariffs on cars and parts would not be charged other duties the administration has imposed on steel, aluminium and goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "The changes came as Trump visited Michigan on Tuesday for a rally to mark his first 100 days in office.",
      "The state is home to the so-called Detroit Three carmakers - Ford, General Motors (GM) and Stellantis - and a network of more than 1,000 major suppliers to the industry.",
      "Those firms and the wider industry have been plunged into uncertainty since Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts in March, saying he wanted to expand domestic car manufacturing - an industry the White House sees as key to national security.",
      "Trump's tariff announcement drove a spike in sales, as consumers rushed to get ahead of the tariffs. But it has also left businesses scrambling to respond.",
      "Ahead of the latest announcement, General Motors and other carmakers said they welcomed the plans to soften the impact of the measures.",
      "\"We're grateful to President Trump for his support of the US automotive industry and the millions of Americans who depend on us,\" GM chief executive Mary Barra said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We appreciate the productive conversations with the President and his Administration and look forward to continuing to work together.\"",
      "General Motors, which reported its quarterly performance to investors on Tuesday, also said on Tuesday that it needed to rework its forecast for the year and pulled its prior guidance.",
      "In an unusual move, it also postponed the call with analysts that had been set to discuss the results.",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "'Kicking butt' or 'going too fast'? Trump voters reflect on 100 days",
      "Why Trump keeps attacking the US central bank",
      "Tariffs on foreign-made cars - which accounted for nearly half of US sales last year - went into effect last month.",
      "The duties on parts were expected to come into force on 3 May.",
      "Under the modified plan, carmakers will be able to claim an \"offset\" for what they pay in tariffs on car parts, worth up to 3.75% of the suggested retail price of all the cars they assemble in the US.",
      "That share would fall to 2.5% in the second year.",
      "The White House said the rules were designed so that a car with 85% of its parts made in the US - or in Canada or Mexico under the terms of an existing free trade deal - would not face any tariffs, a threshold that rises to 90% in the second year.",
      "The adjustment is a recognition of the global nature of the industry's current supply networks, where even cars that promote themselves as American-made often source a significant share of their parts from abroad.",
      "In remarks to reporters ahead of the signing, Trump downplayed the easing, saying they applied to a \"very, very small part of the car\" and while noting he did not want to penalise companies with factories in the US.",
      "\"We just wanted to help them during this little transition, short-term,\" he said.",
      "Last week, a coalition of US motor industry groups called on the president to not impose the measures on parts.",
      "A letter to his administration from groups representing companies including GM, Toyota and Volkswagen said the levies would \"lead to higher auto prices for consumers, lower sales at dealerships and will make servicing and repairing vehicles both more expensive\".",
      "Ford said it appreciated Trump's decision, which it said would \"help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers\".",
      "\"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America,\" a statement added.",
      "The car maker said policies that encouraged exports and ensured affordable supply chains to promote more domestic growth were \"essential\".",
      "\"It will be important for the major vehicle importers to match Ford's commitment to building in America,\" the company said, adding that if they did, the US would see a \"windfall of new assembly and supplier factories and hundreds of thousands of new jobs\".",
      "Stellantis chairman John Elkann echoed the sentiments of his rival carmakers in response to the tariff reliefs.",
      "\"We look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,\" he added."

    "story": [
      "The sugar tax applied to fizzy drinks could be extended to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes under new government plans.",
      "The government is consulting on proposals to end the exemption from the tax for milk-based drinks, as well as non-dairy substitutes such as oats or rice.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in her autumn budget last year that the government was considering widening the levy.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride labelled the move a \"sucker punch\" to households when Labour had \"already pushed up the cost of living for families\".",
      "The sugar tax, known formally as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), is a tax on pre-packaged drinks such as those sold in cans and cartons in supermarkets.",
      "It applies to manufacturers and was introduced by the Conservative government in April 2018 as a means to tackle obesity.",
      "On Monday, the Treasury also confirmed proposals to reduce the maximum amount of sugar allowed in drinks before they become subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.",
      "Some 203 pre-packed milk-based drinks on the market, which make up 93% of sales within the category, will be hit with the tax unless their sugar content is reduced in accordance with the proposals, government analysis says.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government was consulting on \"going further\" with the existing levy after it was shown to have had a particular impact on children's health.",
      "\"We are making sure we are taking practical, sensible measures to improve the health of our children,\" she told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday.",
      "The original exemption for milk-based drinks was included because of concerns about calcium consumption, particularly among children.",
      "Announcing the planned changes, the Treasury said young people only get 3.5% of their calcium intake from such drinks, meaning \"it is also likely that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar\".",
      "\"By bringing milk-based drinks and milk substitute drinks into the SDIL, the government would introduce a tax incentive for manufacturers of these drinks to build on existing progress and further reduce sugar in their recipes,\" it added.",
      "The government estimates that 89% of soft drinks sold in the UK are not subject to the tax because of widespread reformulation by manufacturers since 2018.",
      "But it added that the levy had effectively created a \"target\" of just below the 5g threshold, and products had clustered below 5g as a result.",
      "The government consultation will run from Monday until 21 July.",
      "No drinks with sweeteners for younger children, say UK advisers",
      "Top-brand baby food pouches lack key nutrients",
      "Are sweeteners healthier than sugar?",
      "The SDIL has raised a total of \u00a31.9 billion since its introduction in 2018, according to government statistics released last September. Revenue for HMRC for the 2023-24 financial year was \u00a3338 million.",
      "Opponents of the levy in recent years include the soft drinks industry, pubs and off licences. Some argue the levy disproportionately affects lower-income families and does little to tackle obesity.",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage told the BBC on Tuesday he was \"sick to death of a government telling us how we should live\" and said the focus should be on educating people who can then make decisions about their health.",
      "Meanwhile, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said she had not been a \"fan\" of the levy when it was first introduced by her party, calling it \"a bit too much nanny state\".",
      "She told BBC Breakfast: \"My worry is that the government does not have any plans... and so they're just looking for what else they can tax.\"",
      "But Tam Fry, the chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said he welcomed the proposals \"tremendously\" and said it was \"high-time\" the levy was extended.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"not a game-changer\" in terms of tackling obesity, but \"one of those things that is needed\".",
      "Industry body the Food and Drink Federation said it welcomed the chance to share its views in the consultation.",
      "It said \"significant progress\" had already been made and \"many years of investment in research and development\" had reduced sugar in soft drinks by 46% in the last five years, with a 30% sugar reduction in pre-packed milk-based drinks in the last three years.",
      "It added that food and drink manufacturers were facing a series of inflationary pressures and called on the government to \"continue to create the right conditions for businesses to innovate and also be clear about their long-term goals to promote business confidence\"."

      "The outage began soon after midday Spanish time and cities across the country have been impacted, although the popular tourist destinations of the Balearic and Canary Islands have not been as badly affected.",
      "The blackouts have led to public transport being disrupted, with trains being cancelled. Traffic lights being affected led to the mayor of Madrid to ask residents to keep the roads clear as tunnels of certain highways were closed.",

    "summary": "BBC economics editor Faisal Islam on what comes next for the US president's central economic policy.",
    "story": [
      "Over the past week I have crossed a radically changing North America, from Arizona to Washington DC in the US and then on to Saskatchewan in Canada, witnessing clear evidence of the consequences of historic change in the way the world economy is run. Huge uncertainty means nobody really knows where it is headed.",
      "The walk from the White House Rose Garden to the HQ of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) takes just 9 minutes. In the past few days, in this very short stroll, two very different worlds collided with each other.",
      "The former is the place where at the start of this month, with an extraordinary chart and questionable equation, President Trump took on the world with his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\".",
      "The latter is the place where just three weeks on from that, after rowback, market tumult, and confusion, the finance ministers of the entire world gathered to try to pick up the pieces, even as they were still rebounding off the ground.",
      "At the IMF meetings that included gatherings of G7 and G20 members, something unique happened. The US representatives faced not open hostility, but exasperation, bewilderment and deep concern, from almost the entire rest of the world, for having sent the global economy back towards a crisis, just as it had finally emerged from four years of pandemic, war and energy shocks.",
      "The concern was most acutely expressed by the East Asian countries, who had in early April been classed as \"looters and pillagers\" of American jobs because of the fact that these economies, many of them key allies of the US, export more goods to the US than the other way around.",
      "The talk of the G7 was the quiet determined fury of the Japanese, who were said to feel betrayed by the US turn on trade, and whose confusion over what US trade negotiators actually wanted recently sparked a sell off of US government bonds. The finance minister Katsunobu Kato told the roundtable the US tariffs were \"highly disappointing\", hurting growth and destabilising markets.",
      "I was reminded of the time at the IMF in 2022 when developing country finance ministers asked me if everything was OK in Britain during the mini budget crisis of Liz Truss' government. Then the UK was the source of fragility, trading like an emerging market, when its normal role was solving crises in those markets.",
      "The bugle of retreat",
      "In the face of febrile bond markets, this week the faint sound of the bugle of retreat on the US trade war got louder. A forest of olive branches seemed to be on offer from the US to get the Chinese to come back to the table to negotiate, from respect for their economic achievements to the offer of a deal to do a \"beautiful rebalancing\" of the world economy. It was a far cry from the claims of \"looting and pillaging\".",
      "Yet a much hoped for meeting between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart did not materialise.",
      "Most of the rest of the world leaving their meetings with Bessent are reporting back an assumption that the US is edging away from what it cannot acknowledge was overreach.",
      "And there is a widespread view that there is no need for countries to retaliate, when the CEOs of Walmart and Target are telling the President privately that there will be empty shelves from early May.",
      "The collapse in container traffic from China to the port of Los Angeles - the main artery of the world economy for the first quarter of the 21st century - is the one to watch. The IMF's boffins say they can start to see the impact from space as satellites track fewer, increasingly empty ships leaving China's ports. Of course this will be denied by the US.",
      "West Wing farce",
      "It is true that there was far more relative calm at the end of the IMF Meetings compared to the beginning. Why? Because the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has seized control of the tariff agenda and has almost single-handedly calmed markets and the rest of the world.",
      "Financial diplomats put down the Bessent ascendancy and the critical 90 day pause in the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs to some farcical West Wing antics.",
      "The story goes Bessent was able to get the ear of Trump regarding the bond market damage from his tariffs, only after a separate White House economic adviser managed to use the bait of a fake meeting to lure away the hardline tariff hawk and author of the infamous reciprocal tariff equation Pete Navarro from patrolling the Oval Office.",
      "Wall Street bosses are thought to have suggested that only by firing Navarro, can some semblance of normality return. Insiders suggest that Trump will never get rid of his trade adviser, as he served time in jail after the January 6 riots in support of the President.",
      "At best this sounds like the future of the world economy and all our livelihoods played out like a real time Hilary Mantel novel about the court of Trump. At worst it is leading to financiers and Governments starting to think the unthinkable about how much further the US or the rest of the world might go and  currently, the uncertainty about everything is more concerning than the direct impact of the tariffs.",
      "A nightmarish scenario",
      "And that uncertainty is prompting some fairly wild theories about what might come next.",
      "At times of acute global financial stress, \"swap lines\" between central banks exist to preserve financial stability, making sure there is a constant supply of US dollars.",
      "But now some of the world's central banks have started to game out what might happen if the US chose to use its dollar \"swap lines\" to the rest of the world as a form of diplomatic leverage or even a weapon.",
      "Is it inconceivable that the US might deny them or veto the Federal Reserve handing them out? One just has to assume it is inconceivable, because in many instances there is no way to mitigate it. But the nightmarish scenario for the world financial system, however unlikely, is now not wholly implausible.",
      "A little less unlikely perhaps is the idea that those countries with a trade surplus with the US could help fund the US with an effective tax on their holdings of US government debt. Some of these ideas have been floated in speeches and papers by US government advisers.",
      "In this atmosphere, worrying but incorrect ideas can start to infect confidence. For example, there was a \"whodunnit\" about significant selling of US Government debt just after the original tariff reveal.",
      "Some speculated it was China. But Tokyo currently happens to be the biggest overall creditor to the US. Was this Japanese selling that helped make the case to Trump for the tariff pause, an almost deliberate diplomatic tactic? Two very well connected officials suggested this scenario to me, which shows the febrility right now, even though it seems implausible.",
      "No one crawling",
      "While Bessent commanded the weekend airwaves in the US having assumed control of this process, it was still quite something to see him sending the message that \"Investors need to know that the U.S. government bond market is the safest and soundest in the world\". If you have to say it\u2026",
      "Another significant finance minister told me of his global counterparts that \"no one was crawling to the Americans\" given the unbeatable effectiveness of the US having to negotiate with its own bond market.",
      "Amid the uncertainty, no one seems to know if the \"baseline\" universal tariff of 10% is even negotiable. President Trump's message that tariff revenue could be sufficient to \"completely eliminate\" income taxes for \"many people\" would rather suggest that it will stay.",
      "\"It depends on who you talk to on which day of week\u2026 I've heard three different positions articulated on the baseline, one by the White House, one by the Commerce Dept, and one by a US Trade representative,\" said one senior G7 official. \"Do you know what the final outcome will be? Whatever the president wants at that moment, shaped by industrial, market and political issues,\" I was told.",
      "Consistent UK diplomacy",
      "This is of particular interest to the UK, because the baseline bites the UK hard. Alongside big tariffs on cars which are our biggest goods export and likely further ones on pharmaceuticals, our second most important export, the US hit to the UK appears inexplicable when by the White House's own creative definition of \"trade cheating\" - running a goods surplus - the US is actually slightly \"cheating\" the UK.",
      "I put this point to the Chancellor several times over two interviews in Washington. She diplomatically rejected that suggestion.",
      "But eventually right at the end of our last interview, strolling around the famous reflecting pool in between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument, she volunteered something rather telling of the changing world. \"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told me. It caused a bit of a fuss back home, but it was not an off the cuff gaffe.",
      "That's because concessions to the US on food standards are off limits for domestic political reasons. This appears to have been accepted by the Americans after consistent UK diplomacy, as the focus remains on a technology prosperity deal. It seems pretty clear now that the UK is going to push ahead with a \"high ambition high alignment\" deal with the European Union. And word had got out here among finance ministers.",
      "A very senior international official used the example of the UK-EU rapprochement as an example of the rest of the world coordinating and \"doing its homework\" as a response to US unreliability. \"Brexit was a bitter divorce, but now I see you are dating again,\" I was told privately.",
      "There was also some relief that the US remained engaged with the World Bank and IMF. The Project 2025 plan that was published in April 2023 by the think tank The Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump presidency envisaged the US leaving those international organisations, and the Governor of the Bank of England recently expressed his concerns to me.",
      "Bessent used the meetings to confirm US commitment to the Bank and the Fund, albeit with a return to their core functions and away from considerations of social issues and the environment. The Europeans counted that as a win.",
      "A grand battle?",
      "But a bigger canvas remains. Will the US use this trade war in order to try to corral the rest of the world on to its side in a grand battle with China? It seems astonishing to have annoyed allies so significantly and fundamentally if this was the strategic point of all this. A test case here is Spain, which faces 20% tariffs as an EU member state.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez met President Xi in Beijing a fortnight ago. Spain's booming economy (the fastest growing advanced economy last year -  and forecast to be again this year) is the only one to be upgraded by the IMF. It is built on green energy, access to foreign labour, tourism and significant investment and technology transfer from China. The US took a dim view of the visit and held a \"frank\" discussion with its finance minister Carlos Cuerpo.",
      "He appeared rather unmoved by all this, telling me at the Semafor World Economy Summit in DC: \"There's a huge trade deficit with China, and we need to correct that by opening up to China, by also attracting Chinese investment, of course, within an overall economic security umbrella. And that can only be done by engaging and actually talking to the Chinese authorities\".",
      "Spain has secured notable Chinese electric vehicle factory investment and technology transfer. The US doesn't like it. But if the US wanted to persuade the Spanish and EU of its reliable long term allyship against China, it is difficult to see the strategy in the past month's tariff accusations and chaos.",
      "Whoever wins in Canada's election will bring that G7 economy firmly back into this globally transformative debate. Could the newly elected Canadian PM start a full fat negotiation with the UK too? And then he will chair the G7 Summit in Canada in June as President Trump's 90 day deadline expires. It is presumed Donald Trump will travel to Alberta, to the country he claims should be part of his own.",
      "There is a path to trade peace, calm and deescalation. But it could get much worse too. This is a critical few weeks for the world economy.",

    "summary": "There is greater competition among mortgage firms but no guarantee that rates will keep falling, brokers say.",
    "story": [
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit and a substantial fee.",
      "More frequent cuts in interest rates by the Bank of England are expected this year, amid global economic turmoil.",
      "However, lenders are already reflecting those predicted cuts in their latest deals, suggesting borrowers could be taking a risk by relying on ongoing drops in mortgage costs.",
      "\"If the base rate does come down then there is a chance fixes could get a bit cheaper but there are no guarantees,\" said Aaron Strutt, from broker Trinity Financial.",
      "Timing issue for borrowers",
      "Some tracker and variable rate mortgages move closely in line with the Bank of England's base rate, which is expected to be cut from 4.5% on 8 May.",
      "However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "The average rate for a two-year fixed deal is now 5.21%, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts. A typical five-year deal has a rate of 5.12%.",
      "Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder",
      "Low-deposit mortgage deals highest for 17 years",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "However, lenders are offering attention-grabbing sub-4% deals again to some customers. They were seen briefly in February, but market-watchers had not expected them to return for a while.",
      "The fallout from US tariffs policy has led the markets to settle on a view of more base rate cuts this year.",
      "As a result, so-called swap rates - a key measure on which mortgage deals are priced - have fallen.",
      "Equally, there is now little to tell between swap rates - and therefore mortgage rates - over two years and five years.",
      "\"More borrowers are taking two-year fixes on the assumption rates will reduce but many may be better off taking longer term fixes for the payment security,\" Mr Strutt said.",
      "Rachael Hunnisett believes that many people want to step away from \"the roulette wheel\" of short-term fixed-rate deals.",
      "\"There is a cohort who just do not want to take that level of risk with their home,\" she said, arguing that everyday payments, like children's activities, are affected if borrowers find themselves having to pay a higher rate after two years.",
      "She is the director of mortgage distribution at April Mortgages, which provides 10 and 15-year mortgages. The rates are generally higher, but the certainty of payments she feels is a selling point.",
      "The company is now offering home loans at seven times a borrower's income, which is higher than for many shorter-term loans.",
      "Brokers say this is one example of a host of lenders competing by potentially allowing customers more flexibility to borrow larger amounts, particularly first-time buyers.",
      "They also point to the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide, making changes earlier in the week that offered improved rates to those remortgaging - another sign of greater competition.",
      "David Hollingworth, from broker L&C, said that the sub-4% deals were now becoming part of the core range of mortgages offered by the big lenders.",
      "But he warned the global economic uncertainty meant these rates could quite quickly move either way.",
      "As a result, borrowers were increasingly applying for deals, almost as a backstop months before their old deals expired, he said. If rates improve before the new deal starts, then they could still switch to a better rate."

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 16:07:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The US central bank is one of Trump's favourite punching bags. But how serious is the threat?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank.",
      "Elevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.",
      "But however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse.",
      "Not only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Coming at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.",
      "The tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.",
      "It came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.",
      "But Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.",
      "Donald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy.",
      "\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"",
      "What is Trump's problem with Powell?",
      "Trump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.",
      "Lower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.",
      "Trump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.",
      "He objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.",
      "\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.",
      "A threat to Fed independence?",
      "Trump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.",
      "Nor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.",
      "Trump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.",
      "It has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.",
      "The idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.",
      "Sarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled.",
      "If shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.",
      "\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.",
      "Can Trump fire Powell?",
      "Joe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.",
      "\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy.",
      "He said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed.",
      "\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"",
      "Powell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him.",
      "But the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate.",
      "By law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.",
      "The administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure.",
      "Mark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.",
      "\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.",
      "Asked again for his thoughts a few days later, Mr Spindel wrote back just two words in reply: \"Damage done.\""

      "The annual bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3166 a year, a drop of nearly 9%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "It comes after a series of household bills became more expensive in April, and would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,683.",

    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",

      "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.",
      "I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.",
      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",
      "Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.",
      "He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.",
      "Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.",
      "They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.",
      "Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.",
      "The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.",
      "It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.",
      "But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.",
      "Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.",
      "To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.",
      "So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.",
      "\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.",
      "\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning \u2013 such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way \u2013 a challenge,\" they said.",
      "At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.",
      "For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.",
      "The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.",
      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",
      "Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.",
      "\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.",
      "Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (\u00a312,500).",
      "Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.",
      "In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.",

      "\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.",
      "\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"",
      "As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.",
      "Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.",
      "\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.",
      "Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.",
      "\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.",
      "Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.",
      "\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.",
      "\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.",
      "He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 06:56:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Caribbean nation of Guyana is breathing a sigh of relief after US President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on the introduction of higher tariffs on a number of countries.",
      "Guyana, which is nestled between Venezuela and Suriname on the South American mainland, had been singled out for rates of 38% on many of its exports.",
      "Following Trump's change in policy, it now faces tariffs of only 10% - the same as all countries apart from Canada, China and Mexico.",
      "But why had Guyana been facing a higher levy in the first place?",
      "Guyanese political commentator Francis Bailey says the country is caught in a geopolitical battle between the US and China. Or more specifically - Washington objects to Beijing's \"very strong foothold\" in Guyana.",
      "Recent years have seen billions of dollars of investment in Guyana by Chinese entities, in everything from roads and hospitals, to hotels and shopping centres. And a crucial new bridge linking the capital Georgetown to the western region of Demerara-Mahaica is currently under construction by a Beijing-based company.",
      "For its part, the US continues to be happy to buy Guyana's key exports of crude oil, gold and bauxite, which is the ore from which aluminium is extracted. These were all to be exempt from the planned 38% tariff, which instead would have hit Guyana's fishing and sugar industries.",
      "The US also backs Guyana in its territorial dispute with Venezuela over the vast Essequibo region that forms the western two thirds of Guyana. During a visit to Georgetown in March, Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned Venezuela of \"consequences\" if it were to use force against Guyana.",
      "But the planned high tariff showed Washington's ire, says Mr Bailey. \"I think the reason we had been given such high tariffs is to apply pressure on Guyana.",
      "\"The US is saying, 'if you want our protection you need to chase the Chinese out of your country'. Trump is a very transactional president \u2013 and Guyana is in a very precarious position against its sabre-rattling adversary Venezuela which has been ramping up acts of aggression.\"",
      "The Guyanese government did not respond to requests for comments before this article was initially published. However, it subsequently put out a statement denying that the country's initially high tariff from the US had anything to do with its relationship with China.",
      "It pointed to the website of the US Trade Representative, which it said \"very transparently indicated that the formula for determining the tariff applied to each country is based on the trade balance between the US and the country concerned, and that the formula does not include any variable to capture the relationship of the country concerned with any other country whatsoever\".",
      "The country, once one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere, and a former British colony, has been enjoying a surge in wealth since it first discovered oil in its territorial waters in 2015.",
      "Last year it exported $3.13bn (\u00a32.4bn) of crude oil to the US, according to United Nations figures.",
      "Across the Caribbean all countries now face a 10% tariff on their exports to the US. However, it is the price impact of Trump's global tariffs on what they import from the US that is of most concern.",
      "This is because the Caribbean's love for, and reliance on, US products is immediately apparent when you glance at a High Street or supermarket shelf across the region. In fact, some islands are said to import as much as 70% of their consumer goods from their North American neighbour.",
      "And with American goods that rely on overseas raw materials or components set to go up in price, this will inevitably be passed on to consumers in the Caribbean.",
      "Also, much of what Caribbean nations buy from other countries around the world comes to them via the US.",
      "So with the White House now hitting Chinese goods coming into the US with tariffs of 125%, Chinese items that are then reexported to the Caribbean should see price hikes of a similar amount. And by around 10% for goods from other countries that arrive via the US.",
      "With already ever-increasing shipping costs in the Caribbean, and high local import duties causing exorbitant prices in a region beset by low wages, the impact of Trump's tariffs could be profound and keenly felt.",
      "In Antigua and Barbuda, interior designer Carissa Warner tells the BBC that 70% of her materials are imported from the US, and 20% from China.",
      "\"Some of my projects are on hold while we wait to see what happens,\" she explains. \"I am extremely worried from a business aspect but also just as a local consumer.",
      "\"I'm so worried about the cost of food I have been looking online for pots to start growing fresh produce. I don't think people realise the impact it will have on us.\"",
      "Ms Warner believes one way Caribbean governments could ease the squeeze on their people is by lowering their own import duties, which are partially calculated using a percentage of an item's cost.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's Prime Minister Gaston Browne has dubbed global tariffs \"extremely worrisome\" and is urging citizens to \"buy smarter and buy local\".",
      "Trump's tariffs come as the Caribbean is already grappling with a confluence of harsh economic conditions from the cost of cleaning up after frequent natural disasters like hurricanes, to the aftereffects of the Covid pandemic.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the US, Sir Ronald Sanders, says that the US has long enjoyed a trade surplus with most Caribbean countries.",
      "\"For decades, we have helped sustain American prosperity by collectively importing far more from the United States than we export,\" he says.",
      "\"The problem we have created for ourselves is that we have been dependent on the US market for such a long time and have not sought to diversify into other markets.\"",
      "As for the 10% tariff on Caribbean exports to the US, Sir Ronald says: \"Any loss is not a good thing for our small economies, but the 10% that we face is not going to disrupt our goods from going to the US market.\"",
      "The Caribbean islands' small market sizes, high labour costs and remoteness from principle markets has kept their manufacturing sectors relatively modest. Their exports include many niche products like specialist rums and indigenous foods such as ackee, a fruit from Jamaica.",
      "\"These kinds of products are all orientated to a certain kind of market and will not face any competition because the US does not produce them, and the countries that do face their own tariffs,\" Sir Ronald continues.",
      "Exacerbating worries in the Caribbean are potential additional taxes on Chinese-built ships entering US ports of up to $1.5m per docking. This idea was mooted by the White House in February.",
      "Many fear that will aggravate freight costs in the Caribbean, and lead to further hikes in the price of everyday goods, given the large volume of items sold in the region that are manufactured in China.",
      "Sir Ronald adds that tacking the problem of an overreliance on the US \"can only come from diversifying the market, but that's not an overnight achievement\".",
      "He adds: \"It's not as easy to set up new markets as people think. It's not governments who control trade; it's the private sector. And much of what we buy will still come via the US.\"",
      "Many Caribbean leaders feel the best strategy to thwart the fallout from tariffs is to negotiate as a bloc.",

      "Speaking surrounded by geraniums, he said he was happy to take any form of payment, although card was slightly easier albeit slower to process.",

      "The report comes as the Post Office announced a renewed deal with banks to ensure customers can access basic banking services at post office counters.",
      "The deal, which runs until the end of 2030 allows customers of 30 banks and building societies to use their local post office to withdraw and deposit cash, make balance queries and deposit cheques.",
      "Some campaigners have called for cash acceptance to be enforced by the law now.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:31:13 GMT",
    "summary": "The Irish band have a reputation for provocation, but a new row has led to rising scrutiny and anger.",
    "story": [
      "To their fans, west Belfast rave-rap group Kneecap are a rowdy, subversive force of nature. But to many others, their inflammatory political messages make them dangerous and amoral.",
      "Following in the footsteps of anti-establishment rap groups like NWA and Run The Jewels, the trio present themselves as dissident underdogs, giving a voice to the oppressed.",
      "Their lyrics, delivered in a rapid-fire mix of English and Irish, cover everything from drug-fuelled parties to their desire to free Northern Ireland from British rule.",
      "On stage and on film, they've created a riotous experience that's thrilled Glastonbury, won a Bafta award, and inspired what's been called an \"Irish language revolution\".",
      "But their rising profile has resulted in increased scrutiny and anger about their political statements.",
      "During an incendiary performance at the Coachella music festival in California earlier this month, they described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide. As a result, they've been called anti-Semitic and branded \"terrorist sympathisers\".",
      "Now, footage from two previous gigs is being assessed by counter-terrorism police in the UK.",
      "In one, the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.",
      "Kneecap have responded with a statement, saying they \"do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah\".",
      "They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.",
      "But Cox's widower Brendan was unimpressed, calling their statement \"only half an apology\". Downing Street agreed, describing their words as \"half-hearted\" and \"completely unacceptable\".",
      "The row was discussed in the House of Commons on Tuesday, with Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp calling their comments \"evil\".",
      "It isn't the band's first brush with controversy. If anything, controversy is in their DNA. But this time, the fallout threatens to engulf their career, with venues and festivals under pressure to cancel the band's gigs.",
      "To understand how we got here, here's Kneecap's origin story.",
      "Kneecap were formed in 2017 by rappers Mo Chara (Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh) and M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap (Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in), alongside beatmaker DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed (JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh).",
      "Their career was sparked by an incident in which M\u00f3gla\u00ed and a friend were out spray-painting the day before a march in support of an Irish Language Act.",
      "M\u00f3gla\u00ed had written \"cearta\" (rights) on a bus stop when police arrived. He fled but his friend was arrested, and spent a night in the cells after refusing to speak English to the police.",
      "They documented the incident in the song C.E.A.R.T.A, which they released \"just for the craic. No plans for after,\" Mo Chara told the Irish Times.",
      "To their surprise, the song was playlisted by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9, only to be removed after listeners complained about drug references in the lyrics.",
      "After that, their output was sporadic. The mixtape 3CAG (slang for the drug MDMA) arrived in 2018, followed by the singles H.O.O.D and MAM - dedicated to M\u00f3gla\u00ed's mother, who had died by suicide.",
      "Those early records showcased an ability to move between sharp satire, tender vulnerability and the experiences of Northern Ireland's \"ceasefire babies\" - the generation born around the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.",
      "Talking to the BBC in 2023, the band said they were inspired by US bands like Dead Prez, NWA and Wu Tang Clan.",
      "\"Rebel music in Ireland has all the same sort of ideas as hip-hop in America. A community that's oppressed, using songs to revolt in some way,\" said Mo Chara.",
      "Unusually, they perform most of their lyrics in Irish, reclaiming the language from rural folk music.",
      "\"The only way that Irish history and mythology was passed down was orally. I think that's why it's important for us to have that intertwined with our music,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told Crack magazine last year.",
      "Kneecap's lyrics frequently contain Republican slang and slogans. Even their name is a reference to the IRA's chosen method of punishment for alleged drug dealers during the Troubles.",
      "The messaging has landed them in hot water before. DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed lost his job as a teacher in 2020 after his school was alerted to a video of a concert where he'd painted \"Brits out\" on his buttocks.",
      "Two years later, the band made headlines in Belfast after commissioning a mural of a burning police vehicle with a slogan criticising Northern Ireland's pre-Good Friday police force, the RUC.",
      "Designed to promote a festival appearance, it was criticised by politicians across the  spectrum.",
      "\"Loathe to give the band more publicity,\" said Alliance leader Naomi Long, \"but as a community we need to start asking ourselves what messages we're sending out about the kind of future we want.\"",
      "The band have claimed their take on Republicanism is partially tongue-in-cheek - satirising the self-important sloganeering they grew up with.",
      "\"Republicanism is so vast, and on a spectrum,\" M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap told the New York Times. \"We like to toy with it. We like to take the irony on.\"",
      "Certainly, the band's gleeful celebration of drug culture puts them at odds with the old guard of the movement - but the band are serious about their desire for a unified Ireland.",
      "\"The British government has failed us for 100 years,\" Mo Charra told Vulture last year. \"It's not like this is a trial run. You've had enough time and it's failed.\"",
      "Awards success",
      "Kneecap's reputation grew in 2024 with the release of a film, also called Kneecap, which presented a semi-fictional, and often hilarious, account of their rise to fame.",
      "Starring the band as themselves, with Michael Fassbender as M\u00f3gla\u00ed's father, the movie won the audience award at the Sundance Film Festival, with critics praising its \"punky defiance\" and \"unruly energy\", and was nominated for six Baftas.",
      "It was followed by their debut album, Fine Art, a concept record that threw fans into a hedonistic night out with the band at a fictional Belfast pub called The Rutz.",
      "With songs that skewered the music industry and addressed Northern Ireland's mental health crisis, it showcased a band with more to say than their reputation suggested.",
      "Still, in an era of sanitised, apolitical music, Kneecap's instincts for provocation and protest were inevitably going to draw attention.",
      "Pro-Palestinian chants have featured in their gigs since the start of the latest Israel-Gaza war. But when they brought those messages to Coachella, they faced a new level of scrutiny and criticism.",
      "Kneecap weren't the only people who uttered pro-Palestinian messages at the festival, but accusations of genocide and video screens that declared \"F*** Israel\" were seen by some as crossing a line into hate speech.",
      "The organisers of Israel's Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed by Hamas in 2023, said Kneecap's message \"deeply hurt\" their community, and invited the band to visit an exhibition about the victims and survivors \u2013 \"not to shame or silence but to connect\".",
      "Others took a more strident tone. A music industry group called The Creative Community For Peace, along with Sharon Osbourne, called on the US government to revoke the band's visas.",
      "The band's manager defended their actions. Citing Hamas-run health ministry figures that more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed since the start of the war, Daniel Lambert characterised criticism of the Coachella performance as \"moral hysteria\".",
      "\"If somebody's hurt by the truth, that's something for them to be hurt by,\" he told RT\u00c91. \"But it's really important to speak truth and thankfully, the lads are not afraid to do that.",
      "\"They have the bravery and the conviction, given where they've come from in a post-conflict society, to stand up for what's right, and [they] are willing to do that despite the fact that it may harm their career.\"",
      "Right now, their career is under intense pressure.",
      "Since Coachella, Kneecap have received death threats and have been dropped by their booking agents in the US, which could jeopardise their visas ahead of a forthcoming sold-out tour.",
      "The discovery of the concert video in which the band shouted \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" and advised the audience to \"kill your local MP\" shocked the political establishment, with counter-terrorism police reviewing the footage.",
      "In Scotland, First Minister John Swinney has called for the band to be dropped from Glasgow's TRNSMT festival, saying their comments had \"crossed a line\".",
      "The Eden Project in Cornwall has cancelled their gig in July, and others, including Glastonbury, are under pressure to call off appearances.",
      "Home Office minister Dan Jarvis said on Tuesday: \"There is an ongoing live police investigation, so the government would urge the organisers at the Glastonbury Festival to think very carefully about who is invited to perform there later this year.\"",
      "At the same time, the criticism has only increased the profile of an act who were essentially an underground act a month ago.",

    "story": [
      "The trial has begun of 10 people who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at a Paris hotel in 2016.",
      "The reality TV star and business woman was tied up and held at gunpoint in a luxury suite where she was staying during Paris Fashion Week.",
      "About $10m (\u00a37.5m) worth of jewels were taken from her, including a $4m (\u00a32.9m) diamond engagement from then-husband Kanye West.",
      "In a grand courtroom adorned with 19th Century tapestries, the court was given a fascinating snapshot into the lives of the diverse cast of characters suspected of involvement in the heist.",
      "For the first one up - 71-year-old Yunice Abbas - this was done through a \"enqu\u00eate de personnalit\u00e9\", a sort of background report on a person accused of a crime which French courts regularly include in their trials. These reports take in elements of the defendant's family history, behaviour and work to paint a picture of their lives and help jurors make a decision.",
      "The court heard a long list of crimes that Abbas has been found guilty of in the past - from petty crime and small-time drug trafficking to bank robberies - and retraced his difficult childhood, which was partly spent in Algeria and marked by the deaths of two of his siblings.",
      "Abbas - who has spent almost a third of his life in jail - has already admitted to his role in the heist, and even wrote a memoir entitled I Held Up Kim Kardashian. The president of the court, David De Pas, suggested that the book shows Abbas was proud of what he did - something he has repeatedly denied.",
      "When asked if he had any sympathy for his victims, Abbas said that he never did before the Kardashian heist, \"but this time I do regret what I did\u2026 It opened my eyes.\"",
      "Abbas said that while watching television in jail, he was confronted with relentless coverage of the burglary, which made him realise how much Kim Kardashian had suffered.",
      "\"We just grabbed the lady's handbag but I have discovered there's trauma behind it,\" he said.",
      "The court also focused on Gary Madar, whose brother's company provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for several years. Now 35, the father-of-two has been accused of feeding information to the gang about Kim Kardashian's location on the night of the heist.",
      "At the time, Gary worked as a customer service agent in airports for the transport company. His task was to welcome VIPs arriving at Paris airports and escort them through passport and customs checks. Through this job, he met the Kardashians several times.",
      "But he also worked at a caf\u00e9 owned by another defendant, Florus H\u00e9roui, 52, to whom investigators believe Madar passed on information about Kim Kardashian.",
      "He has denied this and his lawyer has told the BBC that Madar should not be on the dock as there is \"no solid proof\" of his involvement.",
      "Marc Boyer, 78, who is accused of supplying the weapon that was used to threaten Kardashian, was also questioned at length. He expressed regret that his son Marc-Alexandre Boyer - also a defendant - had grown up surrounded by \"thieves\" and \"crooks\" who had led him to make the wrong life choices.",
      "The rest of the week will see more defendants take the stand as the trial ticks on towards 13 May - the day Kim Kardashian is expected to testify.",
      "Most of the 400 journalists reporting on this trial are expected to flock to the courthouse that day, and court staff are unsure how they will accommodate so many reporters who will want a front seat.",

      "The court will only hear from 10 out of the 12 people who were arrested in 2017, as one died last month, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he has advanced dementia.",
      "Another, Aomar Ait Khedache, will be up on Wednesday - but he is now nearly deaf and mute and will have to write his answers down on a piece of paper.",
      "The trial is taking place eight and a half years after the heist.",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and author of a book on the robbery, told the BBC that Paris courts were busy with large terrorism trials for several years, which created a backlog.",
      "She also said the long wait had to do with the defendants' age and health issues which meant they spent little time in provisional detention.",
      "\"Once they were freed it felt less urgent for judges to bring this to trial,\" Tourancheau said."

      "Mr Adams will resume giving evidence on Wednesday.",

      "Jeremy Vine has said he will no longer post videos of his encounters with motorists while cycling because of the level of online abuse he receives - saying \"it did get to me\".",
      "The TV and radio presenter has for years been posting clips of his London commute, and making the case that some motorists in his videos are driving dangerously and greater consideration needs to be given to cyclists.",
      "He spoke to BBC Radio 4's World at One on Monday about his decision, after announcing on social media on Sunday that he would stop uploading the videos.",
      "\"I do have to deal with quite a lot of incoming, what you would have called flak in the olden days, but now they call it trolling,\" he said.",
      "\"I shouldn't mind, but in the end I just thought I just want to now switch the narrative, I don't want to do this any more and in the end it did get to me,\" the BBC Radio 2 presenter added.",
      "\"Car driving is a religion in this country,\" he said, adding \"if you say anything that runs counter, that's what you get.\"",
      "He read out examples of the comments he had received online, in which people said they wanted to see him injured on the road, or made personal comments about his family.",
      "\"Please only upload another cycling video if it's you getting run down and hospitalised,\" was among the comments Vine read out.",
      "Many of Vine's posts spark debate online over both the driver's actions and his own, while some language used by Vine when talking about motorists has been divisive.",
      "Last week he told broadcaster Gaby Roslin's podcast \"all the people who are not getting enough sex lock themselves in small metal boxes and drive around London\" when describing his experiences in the capital.",
      "\"That's fundamentally what's going on in our society,\" he added.",
      "Challenged by World at One presenter Sarah Montague over whether his own behaviour had been militant, Vine said he was \"just a safety first kind of a guy\".",
      "\"If you drive and you're wanting your kids to be safe on the back you're just a sensible person,\" he added.",
      "\"If you cycle and you'd really rather not have your head crushed by the wheel of a bus you're described as militant or radical.\"",
      "Vine also mentioned his bike recently being stolen from his home as among the reasons why he plans to stop posting the clips.",
      "Writing on social media, he said: \"The trolling just got too bad. They have had well over 100 million views but in the end the anger they generate has genuinely upset me.",
      "\"My aim was only to get all of us who drive to think about the dangers of trying to move around cities on a pushbike.",
      "\"I know I've sometimes got a little cross when a driver has, say, pulled out without looking, but I only ever uploaded the film to show the danger.\"",
      "In 2018, Vine told the London Assembly transport committee that he filmed up to 40 driving offences every day cycling from Chiswick in West London to the BBC offices in Oxford Circus.",
      "The year before, a woman was jailed for shouting and making a gun sign at him as he cycled home from work."

    "summary": "It is not yet clear who will be held responsible for the cost of repairing Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8.",
    "story": [
      "A child has damaged a painting worth millions of pounds by the American artist Mark Rothko at a museum in Rotterdam.",
      "A spokesperson for the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen said it was considering the \"next steps\" for the treatment of Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8.",
      "The damage occurred during an \"unguarded moment\", a museum spokesperson told the Dutch media outlet Algemeen Dagblad (AD) last week.",
      "A spokesperson for the museum told the BBC the damage was \"superficial\", adding: \"Small scratches are visible in the unvarnished paint layer in the lower part of the painting\".",
      "The abstract painting is estimated to be worth up to \u20ac50m (\u00a342.5m), according to newspaper AD.",
      "\"Conservation expertise has been sought in the Netherlands and abroad. We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting\", the museum spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.",
      "Sophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".",
      "This is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.",
      "\"In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,\" Ms McAloone said.",
      "The Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot \u2013 a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum \u2013 as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of \"public favourites\" from the gallery's collection.",
      "Jonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"",
      "\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Restoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.",
      "He said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.",
      "Conservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.",
      "\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Rothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.",
      "Umaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.",
      "During his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.",
      "Rachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".",
      "This includes \"accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions\", she said.",
      "She said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum.",
      "The loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.",
      "The museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.",
      "The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.",
      "In 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.",
      "Sharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: \"It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.\"",
      "The Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.",
      "Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 painting is one of several works of modern art that have been damaged in the Netherlands in recent years.",
      "In November 2024, multiple screen prints by the US pop artist Andy Warhol were damaged by thieves during an attempted robbery of the MPV art gallery in the town of Oisterwijk.",
      "In another incident, a Dutch town hall admitted it \"most likely\" disposed of 46 artworks by accident \u2013 including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen \u2013 during renovation works last year.",
      "Museums have different policies when responding to damage caused by children.",
      "In August last year, a four-year-old boy accidentally smashed a 3,500-year-old jar into pieces at the Hecht Museum in Israel.",
      "At the time, Hecht Museum worker Lihi Laszlo told the BBC the museum would not treat the incident \"with severity\" because \"the jar was accidentally damaged by a young child\".",
      "The family were invited back to the exhibition with his family for an organised tour shortly after the incident occurred.",

      "\"You're watching yourself get personally ripped apart, criticised, accused of all sorts of stuff over and over again. You're thinking, this isn't true. It isn't true. What's coming next?\"",

      "Wallace said that at the time, his mother called him to ask why people were \"picking on him\".",
      "He said he responded: \"I've said something really stupid. They're investigating my behaviour, but more and more people are coming forward with complaints about me. Mum, they're not all true. I haven't done these things.\"",
      "Wallace revealed that his mother recently died, adding that it was \"terribly sad\" that she had spent the last few days of her life reading \"horrible things\" about him.",
      "One of the women who spoke to BBC News as part of its investigation was broadcaster Kirsty Wark who appeared on Celebrity MasterChef.",
      "Wark accused Wallace of telling \"sexualised jokes\" during the filming of the show, and said that it left people feeling \"uncomfortable\".",
      "But Wallace says he was never aware he had offended her until it came to light last year, saying: \"I thought we got on.\"",
      "Other high-profile media personalities, including Vanessa Feltz and Kirstie Allsopp, also spoke up at the time.",
      "Wallace said that Feltz's complaint \"knocked him for six\", and also pushed back against Allsopp's comments about his language, saying: \"I wouldn't have said that.\"",
      "'Absolutely not true'",
      "Writing on Instagram in November, singer Sir Rod Stewart described Wallace as an \"ill-mannered bully\", and said the presenter \"humiliated\" his wife Penny Lancaster when she was on Masterchef in 2021.",
      "Addressing that claim, Wallace said it was a \"shame\" as he liked Sir Rod. He acknowledged there had been a \"falling out\" between himself and Lancaster, but said it was over \"whether an orchid should stay on a bowl of soup or not\".",
      "He also addressed other allegations that emerged towards the end of last year, including one that he'd walked around on set naked with a sock on his penis.",
      "He admitted to putting a \"sock over my private bits\" and opening his dressing room door shouting \"hooray\", but claimed he did this to three friends who were in the studio after filming had finished, rather than while it was taking place.",
      "He admitted that some of the inappropriate jokes were \"probably true\", saying: \"Some of what's been said sounds like the sort of comments I'd have made.\"",
      "But he insisted he never groped any workers, calling those claims \"absolutely not true\".",
      "He also said that many of those who work with him had been supportive, including John Torode, his co-presenter on MasterChef.",
      "Torode has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "When Banijay launched an inquiry, Wallace said his \"world tumbled in\".",
      "\"It's very difficult to explain the pressure unless you've been through it. I thought about suicide all the time: \"Is my insurance up to date? Will [Wallace's wife] Anna get some money? She doesn't deserve this. It would be better if I wasn't here.\"",
      "He told the newspaper Banijay had arranged for a crisis mentor to support him.",
      "Wallace said he was recently diagnosed with autism, saying: \"I want to make it absolutely clear I'm not blaming my behaviour on my diagnosis, but it does explain a hell of a lot to me.\"",
      "He added that he accepts he was \"very slow to wake up\" to a changing work environment.",
      "\"It wasn't until seven years ago that I had a massive wake-up call and realised the loud, energetic greengrocer persona I was on the telly was, maybe, becoming redundant. So I changed.\"",
      "\"I honestly never meant to upset anyone. I thought I was going in every day and just delivering what was wanted. I didn't realise I was causing any problems.\"",
      "Wallace has been one of Britain's most high profile presenters for more than two decades.",
      "BBC News, which is editorially independent from the wider organisation, started investigating Wallace last summer, after becoming aware of allegations. The claims were made across five shows, from 2005 to 2022.",
      "Most of the allegations came from production workers. Many were young female freelancers.",
      "Allegations heard include Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to \"give her a fashion show\", and telling a junior female colleague he wasn't wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans.",
      "BBC News has also heard from a former MasterChef worker who says he showed her topless pictures of himself and asked for massages, and a former worker on Channel 5's Gregg Wallace's Big Weekends, who says he was fascinated by the fact she dated women and asked for the logistics of how it worked.",
      "Another female worker on MasterChef in 2019 says Wallace talked about his sex life; a female worker on the BBC Good Food Show in 2010 says Wallace stared at her chest; and a male worker on MasterChef in 2005-06 says Wallace regularly said sexually explicit things on set.",
      "After BBC News's initial investigation, more women came forward with claims.",
      "One woman says he touched her bottom at an event and another says he pressed his crotch against her while filming on a different show.",
      "His lawyers have strongly denied he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature.",
      "Wallace has repeatedly declined interview requests from BBC News.",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 16:51:37 GMT",
    "summary": "As the BBC finds some pockets of bad behaviour among a small number of staff, what happens next?",
    "story": [
      "Samir Shah's anger was obvious, the BBC chairman's voice shaking with fury as he delivered his message of change. \"If you think you're too big to live by the values of this organisation, you are wrong and we will find you out,\" he promised.",
      "He left little doubt about his personal determination to stamp out bad behaviour at the BBC.",
      "But will he succeed?",
      "The Respect at Work 2025 report was commissioned following Huw Edwards' guilty pleas last year. The corporation was reeling from the revelations surrounding one of its biggest names.",
      "But 12 years ago, a report was published after a scandal involving another former BBC star.",
      "That 2013 Respect at Work review looked into BBC culture in light of Jimmy Savile's depravity. It found bullying was an issue inside the corporation, with some people viewed as \"untouchable\" because of their status and colleagues too scared to speak up, for fear of reprisals.",
      "The then director general, Tony Hall, said he wanted \"zero tolerance of bullying\". The BBC brought in a series of measures, including updating its policies and setting up a confidential helpline.",
      "'We have your backs'",
      "On Monday, the current director general, Tim Davie, said he was \"totally committed to make long-lasting change.\"",
      "He said staff must feel confident to speak up and they will be supported (unless their complaints are malicious) without any negative impact on their careers.",
      "\"We have your backs,\" he said. He announced a series of measures including a new code of conduct, a more robust disciplinary policy and leadership training.",
      "All organisations have bad apples, but the power dynamics in a media company are multi-layered. Well-known presenters, for example, can wield extraordinary influence, as well as behind-the-scenes editors and managers.",
      "Then there is the issue of an industry that often relies on freelancers, who have even less power. 30% of freelancers told the report they had seen inappropriate behaviour at the BBC. Less than half said they would feel safe speaking up. That is sobering.",
      "Equally, in BBC news and current affairs, only 48% of staff who answered a recent survey said they thought the corporation dealt with bullying and harassment concerns appropriately.",
      "This is all about power imbalances. Will BBC employees ever feel confident that the organisation really will have their backs if they decide to complain?",
      "My sense is that the biggest consideration when deciding whether to make a formal complaint is the fact that the person you are complaining about will be told you have done so. If that person is your boss, or a close colleague, how can you be sure that it won't have an impact on your career?",
      "But equally, if you don't take formal action, then there is a perception that offenders consistently get away with bad behaviour. There are rumours and stories about particular individuals inside the BBC, just as there are in all organisations.",
      "The proof, perhaps, of whether these new policies are working will be whether the small number of people whose names are often raised internally, accused informally of bad behaviour, will now face more scrutiny; whether colleagues will feel confident to raise a formal complaint.",
      "The report makes clear the majority of people enjoy working at the BBC and that there isn't a toxic culture. But it also talks of some names repeated several times as people who are \"not being held to account for poor behaviour\".",
      "Who are those people and is any action being taken in light of this review?",
      "The report doesn't name names, either complainants or those accused.",
      "A BBC source told me the corporation will always act if necessary on any information it becomes aware of.",
      "But in pockets of the BBC there is real anger that bullying by individuals is an open secret - and there's a belief that complainants aren't protected. Shah and Davie are promising that will change.",
      "It takes time to change cultures. While some behaviour is always unacceptable - sexual harassment or physical assault for example - the report also talks about grey areas, including colleagues being tetchy or rude, ridiculing ideas or using aggressive language. The plan is to nip these in the bud.",
      "Sometimes this kind of behaviour has been blamed on working in a high pressure environment, for example a newsroom, where short-term emotions can run high. It's not an excuse, Davie said.",
      "The report was commissioned because of the BBC's newsroom's most high-profile star, Huw Edwards. But his name was never mentioned over its 60 pages.",
      "Perhaps the evidence of real culture change will be if this is the last report the BBC ever does about workplace culture."

    "summary": "Suspects who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in October 2016 stand trial in Paris.",
    "story": [
      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

    "story": [
      "The Netherlands, March 2025. Yungblud is leaving his hotel in Amsterdam when he's approached by a fan in floods of tears.",
      "\"You saved my life,\" she sobs.",
      "\"No, you saved your own life,\" he replies, quietly. \"Maybe the music was the soundtrack, but you saved your own life, OK?\"",
      "Leaning in for a hug, he adds, \"Don't be sad, be happy. I love ya.\"",
      "It's a remarkably touching moment, full of compassion and devoid of rock star ego.",
      "Two weeks later, after a video of the encounter goes viral, Yungblud is still moved by the memory.",
      "\"I didn't think people would see that, except me and her,\" he says, \"but it was such a moment for me.\"",
      "The interaction crystallised something he'd felt for a while.",
      "\"I always said that Bowie and My Chemical Romance saved my life, but ultimately you have to find yourself,\" he says.",
      "\"Like this morning, I put my headphones on and I listened to [The Verve's] Lucky Man, and it made me go, 'Oh, I'm ready to face the day'.",
      "\"But Richard Ashcroft didn't tell me I was ready to face the day. I said that to myself.",
      "\"That's what I was trying to tell that girl in Amsterdam.\"",
      "Self-assurance is a lesson he learned the hard way.",
      "On the surface, Yungblud, aka 27-year-old Dominic Harrison, had it all. Two number one albums, an international fanbase, a Louis Theroux documentary and enough clout to run his own festival.",
      "But if you looked more closely, there were chinks in the armour. Those number one albums both fell out of the Top 30 after one week, a sign of a strong core fanbase, with limited crossover appeal.",
      "And the first year of his Bludfest in Milton Keynes was criticised after long queues and a lack of water caused fans to pass out and miss the concert.",
      "Harrison was keenly aware of it all. As he released his self-titled third album in 2022, he hit a low.",
      "\"Yungblud was number one in seven countries, and I wasn't happy because it wasn't the album I wanted to make,\" he says.",
      "\"It was a good album, but it wasn't exceptional.\"",
      "The problem, he says, was a record label who'd pushed him in a more commercial direction. But in polishing his sound, he lost the angry unpredictability that characterised his best work.",
      "\"It's funny, my-self titled album was actually the one where I was most lost,\" he observes.",
      "\"I felt like I compromised but, because of that, I was never taking no for an answer again.\"",
      "Nowhere is that clearer than on his comeback single, Hello Heaven, Hello.",
      "Over nine minutes and six seconds it achieves Caligulan levels of excess, full of scorching guitar solos, throat-shredding vocal runs, and even an orchestral coda.",
      "\"Do you still remember, or have you forgotten where you're from?\" Harrison asks himself, as he re-ignites his ambition.",
      "The song's purposefully unsuited to radio \u2013 unlike the follow-up single, Lovesick Lullaby. Released today, it's a free-associating rampage through a messy night out, that ends with epiphany in a drug dealer's apartment.",
      "Combining Liam Gallagher's sneer with Beach Boys' harmonies, it's uniquely Yungblud. But the singer reveals it was originally written for his last album.",
      "\"We were actually discouraged from doing it,\" he says.",
      "\"My advisor at the time, a guy called Nick Groff [vice president of A&R at Interscope, responsible for signing Billie Eilish], was like, 'I don't get it'.\"",
      "Warming to the theme, he continues: \"The music industry is crap because it's all about money but, as an artist, I need to make sure that anything I put out is exciting and unlimited.",
      "\"It can't be like a 50% version of me.\"",
      "To achieve that, he shunned expensive recording studios and made his new album in a converted Tetley brewery in Leeds.",
      "Professional songwriters were banished, too, in favour of a close group of collaborators, including guitarist Adam Warrington, and Matt Schwartz, the Israeli-British producer who helmed his 2018 debut.",
      "\"When you make an album in LA or London, everything is great, even if it's mediocre, because people want a hit out of it,\" he argues.",
      "\"When you make an album with family, all they want is the truth.\"",
      "'Sexiness and liberation'",
      "One of the most honest tracks on the record is Zombie, a lighters-aloft ballad (think Coldplay, sung by Bruce Springsteen) about \"feeling you're ugly, and learning to battle that\".",
      "\"I always was insecure about my body, and that got highlighted as I got famous,\" says the singer, who last year revealed he'd developed an eating disorder due to body dysmorphia.",
      "\"But I realised, the biggest power you can give someone over you is in how you react. So I decided, I'm going to get sober, I'm going to get fit, and I discovered boxing.\"",
      "He ended up working with the South African boxer Chris Heerden - who was recently in the news after Russia jailed his ballerina girlfriend, Ksenia Karelina.",
      "\"I met him before all that,\" says Harrison, \"but he's been extremely inspirational. Boxing's become like therapy for me.",
      "\"If someone says something bad about me, I go to the gym, hit the punch bag for an hour and talk it out.\"",
      "Fans have noticed the change\u2026 drooling over photos of his newly chiseled torso, and declaring 2025 his \"shirt-off era\".",
      "\"Maybe the shirt-off era is a comeback to all the comments I've had,\" he laughs.",
      "\"I'm claiming a freedom and a sexiness and a liberation.\"",
      "He's clearly found a degree of serenity, without surrendering the restless energy that propelled him to fame.",
      "Part of that is down to control. In January, he created a new company that brings together his core business of recorded music with touring operations, his fashion brand and his music festival, Bludfest.",
      "The event kicked off in Milton Keynes last summer but suffered teething troubles, when fans were stuck in long queues.",
      "\"I will fully take responsibility for that,\" says the star, who claims he was \"backstage screaming\" at police and promoters to get the lines moving.",
      "\"The problem was, there were six gates open when there should have been 12,\" he says, suggesting people underestimated his fans' dedication.",
      "\"When Chase and Status had played [there] a day before, there were 5,000 people when the doors opened, and another 30,000 trickled in during the day.",
      "\"With my fans, there were 20,000 kids at the gate at 10am. So we've learned a lot for this year. There'll be pallets of water outside. It'll be very different.\"",
      "Dedication to his fans is what makes Yungblud Yungblud.",
      "He built the community directly from his phone and, whether intended or not, that connection has sustained his career - insulating him from the tyrannies of radio playlists and streaming placement.",
      "Maintaining a personal relationship becomes harder as his fanbase grows but, ever astute, he hired a fan to oversee his social accounts.",
      "\"She's called Jules Budd. She used to come to my gigs in Austin and she'd sell confetti to pay for gas money to the next city.",
      "\"She built an account called Yungblud Army, and she's amazing at letting me understand what are people feeling.",
      "\"If people are outside and security aren't treating them right, I know about it because she's in contact with them. So I brought her in to make the community safer as it gets bigger.\"",
      "With his new album, he wants to make that community even bigger. Harking back to the sounds of Queen and David Bowie, he says it'll \"reclaim the good chords\" (Asus4 and Em7, in case you're wondering).",
      "\"The shackles are off,\" he grins.",
      "\"We made an album to showcase our ambition and the way we want to play.",
      "\"Can you imagine seeing Yungblud in a stadium? 100% yes. Let's do it.\""

      "Although it is set in an unnamed US city, all of it - including car chases and shootouts - was filmed in Wales.",
      "Hardy and his co-star Forest Whitaker were spotted filming in south Wales in 2021, but the production experienced several delays because of the pandemic and the writers strike in the US.",
      "Havoc, which also stars Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Jessie Mei Li and Timothy Olyphant, began with the vision of its Welsh director Gareth Evans.",
      "\"I had this, like, one core image which was a corrupt cop in a crime scene where a drug deal's gone wrong and for whatever reason he was scooping cocaine into a coffee cup,\" said Evans, best known for gangster film The Raid and thriller series Gangs of London.",
      "\"And it all mushroomed out from there.\"",
      "Evans said it was \"incredible\" when Hardy came on board in the lead role and as a producer.",
      "\"One of the nicest things about Tom [is] I knew I was in my wheelhouse when it came to action film-making, but with Tom his skillset is deep dive explorations into morally complex characters and so we were able to fuse two styles together.\"",
      "Evans, who grew up in Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, still lives in Wales.",
      "He said recreating the US in south Wales was \"challenging\" but he wanted to bring work to the area.",
      "\"I started going around, like, Swansea, Port Talbot, Cardiff and Newport, looking for any little bit of architecture that I could find that might pass as a little bit Americana,\" he said.",
      "\"And so we took a look and we thought if we can get 30% or 40% real in camera then the VFX (visual effects) can take care of the rest.\"",
      "Swansea's Brangwyn Hall became the outside of an American police precinct, Swansea University's Bay campus provided exterior street shots, and a fishing shack was built in the Merthyr Mawr countryside.",

      "Aram Tertzakian, one of XYZ Films' founders, has worked with Evans since Apostle, the 2018 horror featuring Michael Sheen which was filmed around Margam Park in Port Talbot.",
      "Tertzakian spent much of the pandemic in an Airbnb in Cardiff while Havoc was being filmed.",
      "\"Gareth brought me to Wales for this project because he is a great patriot and wanted to figure out how to make films in Wales,\" said Tertzakian.",
      "He said he believed that after Havoc, filmmakers and producers in the industry are going to be \"a lot more focused on Wales being on the map\".",
      "\"I think it's always been seen as an option but when they see Havoc and what we pulled off, I think it's going to blow their minds and really make Wales a lot more viable for a lot of people.",

    "story": [
      "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt \"overwhelming excitement\" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.",
      "The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would \"do Paddington proud\", adding that the musical numbers are \"my favourite songs I've ever written\".",
      "The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.",
      "The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.",
      "Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt \"so honoured and lucky\" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect \"all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly\".",
      "\"There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,\" he joked.",
      "Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.",
      "He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the show was formally announced in 2023.",
      "With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature \"lots of juicy new material\".",
      "\"We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,\" she said.",
      "\"Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.\"",
      "Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.",
      "The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.",
      "Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what \"the musical language\" of Paddington was. \"Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,\" he explained.",
      "He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with \"a very fast 'yes please'\", but began writing music for the show right away.",
      "\"While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.\"",
      "He reflected: \"My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.\"",
      "The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.",
      "In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.",
      "It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.",
      "\"I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!\" joked Swale. \"He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!\"",
      "She continued: \"I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.\"",
      "'The politics of Paddington'",
      "Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for \"really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it\u201d, adding: \u201cEvery single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.",
      "\"I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.\"",
      "As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical \"also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington\".",
      "\"For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.\"",
      "Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be \"fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right\".",
      "He added: \"I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\"",
      "The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, \"so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in\", he explained.",
      "\"It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.\"",
      "Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.",
      "\"You can rest easy,\" laughed Swale. \"Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.\"",

      "\"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible,\" he says.",
      "In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition.",
      "Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion.",
      "\"It was completely dominating my life,\" Ellie says. \"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days.",
      "\"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better.\"",
      "The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school.",
      "Ellie says she eventually reached \"breaking point\", and even began considering having her affected eye removed.",
      "\"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,\" she says, \"my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.\"",
      "It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection.",
      "Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, funghi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens.",
      "A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world.",
      "Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish.",
      "For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid.",
      "However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks.",
      "\"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one,\" she says. \"So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it.\"",
      "Dr Brown says metagenomics is \"an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer\".",
      "In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America.",
      "It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia.",
      "Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test.",
      "\"I broke down - I just had to cry. I never imagined that it would come back positive and be for something that was treatable,\" she says.",
      "\"I was given three weeks of antibiotics and within days my vision was clearer and the inflammation subsided.\"",
      "A single metagenomics test costs around \u00a31,300, which is far more than standard diagnostics. However, as the technology is developed that price is likely to fall rapidly.",
      "Virologist Professor Judy Breuer, who has been developing metagenomics at GOSH and University College London (UCL) for more than a decade, says her team currently receives three or four samples a week from hospitals around the UK for metagenomic testing in addition to those it carries out on its own patients.",
      "These are often samples from parts of the body that are normally sterile sites, where bacteria are not usually found such as the brain, central nervous system, liver and eye.",
      "\"In the future, we think metagenomics will become a first line test and be able to diagnose infection in any sample, probably within the same day,\" she says.",
      "It's also likely to become faster, cheaper and easier to do, explains Dr Brown, meaning it will become available to more patients rather than just a small number who are severely unwell.",
      "Resolving her eye problems has allowed Ellie to concentrate on her training as a GP and arrange her wedding.",
      "Ellie was married in Newcastle on 29 March, the same day the city celebrated   Newcastle United's win in the Carabao Cup.",
      "She says: \"We got a shout-out from Ant and Dec and went up on a scissor lift above the Newcastle United fans, which was incredible.\"",
      "Prof Breuer says she is thrilled with how the treatment is changing lives.",
      "\"It is amazing to see the impact it is having for patients like Ellie.\"",

      "The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has called for a change in policy due to \"critical\" staff shortages among radiographers who specialise in this area.",
      "Sally Reed, 67, who had two mastectomies after mammograms revealed breast cancer, told the BBC that \"if something can save your life you should go for it\" - whether it's administered by a woman or man.",
      "Major breast cancer screening AI trial to begin",
      "Women urged to book breast screening appointments",
      "'I may not have been here today without mammogram'",
      "But Sally also admits women who already don't want to go for breast screening \"would definitely be turned off by a man\".",
      "Breast X-rays, which look for cancers that are too small to see or feel, are only permitted to be undertaken by female health workers. Mammography is the only health examination carried out exclusively by female staff.",
      "According to radiographers, the vacancy rate among mammographers who specialise in breast exams is 17.5%.",
      "Among mammographers who assess women who have found a lump in their breast or have a family history of breast cancer, the figure is 20%.",
      "It takes three to four years to qualify as a radiographer through a university degree.",
      "Changes to staffing were being discussed at the annual SoR conference, with discussions also taking place over whether transgender men should be included in the NHS breast screening programme.",
      "Sue Johnson, who represents the SoR, told the BBC: \"The role of the radiographer has developed and evolved and there is a much broader scope to the job role than simply taking the images.",
      "\"It's a very desirable and enjoyable career and men are saying 'we would like to access that same career and we could help deliver the service'\".",
      "Johnson said she believes this could help the recruitment of more radiographers and open up the job to more qualified people because \"mammography doesn't get as much publicity\" as other health professions.",
      "The prospect of men performing mammograms has been explored unsuccessfully in the past, but Johnson believes \"the world has changed\" and that \"the time is right\" to start reconsidering the role.",
      "She says women would still be given a choice on who conducted their mammogram if they didn't feel comfortable with a man doing it.",
      "Ms Reed said having two mammograms 15 years apart were responsible for \"saving\" her life.",
      "She's now had two mastectomies after two separate breast cancer diagnoses.",
      "Because of what she's gone through, having a male radiographer \"wouldn't bother me at all\", she says.",
      "But Claire Rowney, chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Now, says \"it's vital that efforts to build up the screening workforce do not inadvertently damage uptake of breast screening\".",
      "She says that \"while we welcome every effort to reduce staff shortages and delays in breast screening, we know that concerns about being seen by a male mammographer already deter some women from attending breast screening, even with current staffing being all-female\".",
      "Ms Rowney adds that recruiting male mammographers could be an issue for some women in ethnic minority communities, who may have greater concerns around preserving their modesty and who may be less likely to take up the offer of screening."

      "Sir Tony Blair has called for a major rethink of net zero policies, arguing that limiting energy consumption and fossil fuel production is \"doomed to fail\".",
      "In a new report, the former Labour prime minister says voters \"feel they're being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know the impact on global emissions is minimal\".",
      "He does not call for Labour to halt its push to decarbonise the UK economy - but says all governments need to rethink their approach, as it is not working.",
      "The Tories - who have joined Reform UK in opposing net zero emissions by 2050 - urged Labour to end the \"mad dash\" to this goal - but Downing Street said it would not be changing course.",
      "In its report The Climate Paradox: Why We Need to Reset Action on Climate Change, the Tony Blair Institute argues that global institutions such as COP and the UN have failed to make sufficient progress in halting climate change.",
      "At the same time, it argues, the public have lost faith in climate policies because the promised green jobs and economic growth have failed to materialise, thanks in part to global instability and the Covid pandemic.",
      "Writing in the foreword, Sir Tony says: \"Though most people will accept that climate change is a reality caused by human activity, they're turning away from the politics of the issue because they believe the proposed solutions are not founded on good policy.\"",
      "He says \"any strategy based on either 'phasing out' fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail\".",
      "He also warns against the \"alarmist\" tone of the debate on climate change, which he  says is \"riven with irrationality\".",
      "The report calls for the rapid deployment of carbon capture and storage technology, greater use of AI to make energy grids efficient and investment in small scale nuclear reactors.",
      "It also argues for a greater focus on climate change mitigation measures such as flood defences and a new international push to persuade China and India to cut emissions.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, the author of the report dismissed claims that the foundation was rejecting net zero targets, saying it \"is a paper that is about increased climate ambition\".",
      "Lindy Fursman, director of climate and energy policy at the Tony Blair Institute, said:  \"We are certainly not rejecting net zero targets. The paper is really clear that we need to keep these because of the certainty they provide for businesses.\"",
      "Ms Fursman said the report was \"pointing out that while many economies are doing well, we need to do more, particularly in the global picture because global emissions continue to rise\".",
      "Downing Street said it would not be changing course on net zero - and rejected Sir Tony's suggestions that the public was no longer prepared to make sacrifices to meet green goals.",
      "\"We will reach net zero in a way that treads lightly on people's lives, not telling them how to live or behave,\" said the prime minister's official spokesman.",
      "\"Net zero is the economic opportunity of the 21st century, one that has the potential to reignite our industrial heartlands, create good jobs for the future and lower bills in the long term.\"",

      "Reacting in the Commons to Sir Tony's comments in the report, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said he agreed \"with a lot of what it says\" particularly on carbon capture and storage and AI \"which the government are doing\".",
      "But Labour's opponents were quick to seize on the former prime minister's words.",

      "\"It seems even Tony Blair has come to the realisation that Keir Starmer and the Labour Party's mad dash to net zero by 2050 is simply not feasible, or sustainable,\" he added.",
      "Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said: \"Blair is wrong, both morally and pragmatically. The British public understands the need for decisive climate action and expects politicians to lead in delivering this action.\"",
      "Sir Tony's intervention has also been met with dismay by Labour-supporting environmental groups.",

      "\"But adopting the anti-net-zero framing of [Tory leader Kemi] Badenoch and Reform is out of step with where the public are on this issue and will not help Labour.\"",
      "A Liberal Democrats spokesperson said: \"There is no doubt that the last Conservative government set us back by failing to invest in cheap, clean energy and home insulation.",
      "\"But that makes it all the more important that we act with urgency now, to bring down energy bills and emissions, free ourselves from reliance on Putin's gas, and restore the UK's role as a world-leader in the clean technology of the future and the jobs that go with it.\"",

    "summary": "Sir Mark Rowley warns that without more funding, the Met will struggle to meet key crime targets.",
    "story": [
      "Rates of knife crime, violence against women, and theft could rise in London without more government funding, the Metropolitan Police commissioner has warned.",
      "In a report, due to be presented by Sir Mark Rowley to the London Policing Board this week, he says the force \"must be honest to Londoners that in light of the budget, we are shrinking as an organisation\".",
      "The commissioner acknowledges that extra funding from the Home Office and City Hall means the Met's final settlement is \"nearly \u00a3100m better\" than it feared in November 2024, when he warned of a \u00a3450m funding gap and \"eye-watering cuts\" to services.",
      "The Home Office has been asked to comment.",
      "Sir Mark says unless the Met receives more money in June's spending review, the government risks being unable to meet its own national promises to halve knife crime, and violence against women and girls, over the next decade.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC London last week that a review of the Met's finances is currently under way, alongside the mayor and Scotland Yard.",
      "The commissioner's report states the force wants to grow in size to 38,000 officers and 19,000 staff, but is forecast to have just 31,248 officers and 10,972 staff by the end of the year.",
      "He predicts the Met will lose about 1,700 officers, PCSOs and staff, but that additional funding may allow the force to reduce the losses by speeding up recruitment.",
      "'Less capacity, increasing demand'",
      "The report warns that with no additional investment, London may experience \"sustained increases\" in knife crime, violence against women and girls (VAWG), and theft.",
      "\"We will have less policing capacity and capability at a time when demand has been steadily increasing,\" the commissioner writes.",
      "\"Undoubtedly this will impact our ability to respond to victims of crime and Londoners and have consequences for our own officers and staff and our reform plans.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Met detailed a list of savings it would need to make in order to protect frontline services such as neighbourhood policing and public protection teams, which tackle sex offences and domestic abuse.",
      "Those plans include scrapping the Royal Parks police and Safer Schools officers, along with cuts to forensics and mounted police, and potentially taking firearms off the Flying Squad.",
      "Sir Mark's report warns the financial challenges are likely to have a \"negative impact on the speed and scale\" of reforms, which the force is under pressure to make following a series of scandals and a highly critical review two years ago by Baroness Casey.",
      "Met to cut 1,700 staff to plug \u00a3260m 'black hole'",
      "Royal Parks police could be cut to plug Met budget",
      "Met given more money for capital city policing",
      "Referring to key promises in the government's manifesto, the report says \"halving knife crime and VAWG will be impossible without significant reductions in London\".",
      "He argues that tackling crime will boost economic growth, stating that London loses at least \u00a336.5bn each year and that \"for every \u00a31 spent on policing, at least \u00a34 is added to the country's GDP\".",
      "Sir Mark also describes how the Met expects, without further funding, that it will have to close \"up to half our current buildings due to them being no longer habitable or legally compliant\".",

    "summary": "Quangos are taxpayer-funded but not directly controlled by central government and include watchdogs.",
    "story": [
      "Over 300 quango bosses received a higher salary than the prime minister last year, according to the TaxPayers' Alliance (TPA).",
      "Quango stands for quasi autonomous non-governmental organisations, which means they are taxpayer-funded but not directly controlled by central government, and include watchdogs as well as the prison service.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer axed the biggest quango, NHS England, last month and the government is currently reviewing hundreds of quangos in a bid to reduce bureaucratic waste and inefficiency.",
      "John O'Connell, chief executive of the TPA, said there should be more scrutiny of the hundreds of \"quangocrats\" taking home \"massive pay packets\" with minimal democratic oversight.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "Ministers to review hundreds of public bodies",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "As prime minister, Sir Keir is entitled to a salary of \u00a3172,153, which is five times higher than the median UK annual salary of \u00a337,430 in April 2024, as measured by the Office for National Statistics.",
      "In all, 315 quango chief executives received a higher salary, according to the TPA, with the top three being Channel 4's on \u00a3619,000, the chief executive of HS2 on \u00a3618,195, and head of Network Rail on \u00a3588,000.",
      "The research also found that at least 1,472 quango staff received more than \u00a3100,000 in total remuneration, which included salary, expenses and pension benefits.",
      "The TPA definition of a quango is wider than others and includes any non-ministerial department, public corporation, agency or other public body included in the government's departments, agencies and public bodies list, including the Bank of England and the BBC.",
      "Mr O'Connell said the TPA backed the Labour government's review of quangos, and urged more focus on scrapping unnecessary functions and bringing delivery of significant services back under political control.",
      "He said: \"Taxpayers will be shocked to hear that there are hundreds of quangocrats heading up bodies they may never have heard taking home massive pay packets the average Brit can only dream of.",
      "\"But beyond the healthy remuneration, arguably the bigger problem is that in many areas of government policy these quango bosses reign supreme, with minimal ministerial or parliamentary oversight despite the often highly sensitive and significant nature of what their organisation is responsible for.",
      "\"The government may have signalled an intent to get a grip of the quango state, but as well as restoring political accountability there needs to be serious review of some of the functions they perform.\"",
      "However, Matthew Gill, the Institute for Government's programme director on public bodies, said focusing on the pay of quango bosses could be misleading.",
      "\"It is important that public bodies are democratically accountable, but ministers cannot micro-manage everything in the public sector,\" he said.",
      "\"They need good people running things \u2013 and pay that is too low to attract them is a false economy.",
      "\"It is very difficult to evaluate whether public sector leaders are paid appropriately without benchmarking their pay to the private sector.\"",
      "Under Sir Keir, the Labour government has set up more than 20 new quangos, including Great British Energy, which will invest in renewable energy to help meet the government's clean power goals; and Skills England, which aims to support people in finding jobs.",
      "Almost 60% of day-to-day government spending is channelled through quangos, with \u00a3353.3bn budgeted for them in 2022/23, according to the latest published figures.",
      "The last major shake-up was under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, when a \"bonfire of the quangos\" scrapped nearly a third of them, including the Audit Commission and the UK Film Council.",
      "Asked last month if the government was planning another \"bonfire of the quangos\", Downing Street said the PM wanted to see a more \"active and agile state\", rather than \"outsourcing\" decisions to other bodies.",
      "Meanwhile, the government has announced it will merge the Valuation Office Agency, which values properties for council tax and business rates, into HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) by April 2026.",
      "It is the latest quango to be scrapped in a move the Treasury said would increase efficiency and cut duplication.",

      "Planned changes to school uniform policy will affect over four million pupils across England, according to new estimates from the Department for Education (DfE).",
      "The government says seven in 10 secondary schools and 35% of primary schools in England will have to reduce the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a branded tie for secondary students.",
      "The new rule is part of the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which still has several parliamentary stages to go through before becoming a law.",

      "The government claims parents will save around \u00a350 per child through the school uniform measures, which it hopes to introduce in September 2026.",
      "But uniform retailers warn that the planned changes might increase costs for families. The Schoolwear Association says the plans could mean parents spend more on replacing lower-quality generic garments which might not last as long as branded items.",

      "Many parents rely on uniform exchanges to afford the full list of items required by their children's schools.",
      "At Darlington Borough Council's exchange, located on the ground floor of a multi-storey car park, all the uniforms have been donated and are free to local parents, who are able to stock up on branded items from over 25 schools in the area.",
      "The exchange has been running for five years and has given out approximately 12,000 items to 4,000 customers.",
      "Volunteer Kay says she is worried some school uniform policies will still be too strict even after the government's planned limit on logos comes into force.",
      "\"Some of the schools are particular about a certain skirt, a certain style from a certain supplier - so that can cause problems and be quite expensive for parents,\" she says.",
      "But she says it is a good thing that more parents will be able to buy more of their uniforms from other retailers, like supermarkets.",
      "In Darlington town centre, one mum with two sons at primary school and a daughter in secondary said she was worried about the jump in uniform costs coming when her sons join secondary school.",
      "\"It's just a nightmare,\" she said.",
      "\"My daughter's school is really strict on the uniform. You can't get black trousers, it's got to be grey, or pleated skirts. For their shoes alone I'm looking at \u00a360 a year, and there's three of them. That's not including blazers, PE kits or anything else.",
      "\"It's a lot of money when it all adds up.\"",
      "Matt Perry, head teacher at The Halifax Academy in West Yorkshire, says he makes sure pupils follow the school's rules on uniform, but also wants to ensure it is affordable for parents.",
      "The school gives its pupils ties for free, and parts of the PE kit and a school blazer are the only compulsory items with branding on.",
      "The school may cut back further if limits to branded items are brought in.",
      "The school is in an area of Halifax with high deprivation, and has a uniform bank as well as a laundrette to wash pupils' uniforms.",
      "Mr Perry says branded school uniform can bring a sense of pride and inclusion, but that tough uniform policies can be a barrier to attendance.",
      "\"There are so many different factors that children have to face in order to have clean and correct uniform that is used daily,\" he says.",
      "\"As long as we see the families really trying to adhere to the uniform policy that we've got, we can be flexible with how we interpret that. So if it is in the right colours but it's not branded, that doesn't matter to us.\"",

      "Interim guidance on single-sex spaces is \"ill-considered and impractical\" and should be withdrawn, the Green Party has said.",
      "The guidance, issued by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), followed the UK Supreme Court's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under the Equality Act.",
      "In places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use women's facilities but they should not be left with no facilities to use, the guidance says.",

      "\"It's been really obvious that they have not listened to trans people,\" she told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.",
      "She added that the guidance put trans people at risk of discrimination, especially in workplaces, and \"seems to fly in face of the strong tradition of tolerance we have in Britain\".",
      "The Green Party said in a statement that the guidance was likely to cause \"distress\" to the trans community as well as \"further confusion to employers, businesses and service providers\" .",

      "When asked to clarify this, the EHRC pointed to a section of the Supreme Court ruling stating that trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken\" in the context of a women-only service.",
      "However, the guidance says where possible mixed-sex toilets or changing facilities should be provided, with lockable rooms intended to be used by one person at a time, in addition to single-sex facilities.",
      "Denyer also raised concerns that for lesbian associations or venues which wanted to include trans women, the advice appeared to say they would not be allowed to.",
      "The guidance states that \"a women-only or lesbian-only association should not admit trans women (biological men)\", while \"a men-only or gay men-only associations should not admit trans men (biological women)\".",
      "Sir Ed also told the programme lots of people were confused and anxious about the guidance, for example over which toilet a trans man (biological woman) should use.",

      "The UK's trade relationship with the EU is arguably \"more important\" than the one it has with the US, the chancellor has told the BBC.",
      "Rachel Reeves suggested that moving closer to the EU on trade was a bigger priority, despite her current focus on talks with the US.",
      "After her meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday, Reeves tweeted that both the UK and US want a deal that is \"in both our national interests\".",
      "Earlier this week, she signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports from their current 10% to 2.5% as part of a wider deal.",
      "The UK is preparing for a summit with the EU in May in an attempt to \"reset\" the relationship between the two.",
      "\"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"Obviously I've been meeting Scott Bessent this week whilst I'm in Washington, but I've also this week met the French, the German, the Spanish, the Polish, the Swedish, the Finnish finance ministers - because it is so important that we rebuild those trading relationships with our nearest neighbours in Europe, and we're going to do that in a way that is good for British jobs and British consumers.\"",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the chancellor's remarks had been \"a statement of fact that the EU is our largest trading partner\".",

      "She has said she wants to see \"free and fair\" trade, and wants to deepen the relationship between the US and UK in areas such as technology.",
      "Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith told Sky News that his party would \"absolutely be seeking to prioritise\" a deal with the US over the EU.",
      "Griffith argued that the UK already had a tariff-free deal on goods with the EU, therefore the \"next best choice if you want to grow the economy after the chancellor's crashed it would be to get a deal with the US\".",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: \"The chancellor is absolutely right that our trading relationship with Europe is more important, but the government's approach so far shows these are little more than empty words.",
      "\"This government has bent over backwards to appease Donald Trump but barely lifted a finger to unleash growth by boosting trade with Europe.\"",
      "'We're all grappling with tariffs'",
      "Regarding the situation with the US, Reeves said she \"understands what President [Donald] Trump wants to address\" with his tariffs, ahead of talks with her US counterpart in Washington.",
      "Reeves said there were similarities with the way both the US and UK governments had come to power off the back of voter frustration with the economy.",
      "\"We're all grappling with this issue of tariffs but I think that there is an understanding why President Trump wants to address some of the global imbalances there are in the system,\" she said.",
      "Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US including from the UK.",
      "The UK also faces a broader tariff rate of 10% and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies \u2013 most of which are currently on pause until July.",
      "Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.",
      "Reeves said she had also been working closely with European and Canadian counterparts to remove trade barriers, and that conversations around the table at G20 meetings this week had been difficult.",
      "\"Obviously there are strains. We are all following what's happening in our domestic bond markets, in our equity markets, and we all know that that uncertainty is bad for investment in the UK economy.\"",

      "The amount of cannabis posted to the UK from Thailand has dropped by 90% in three months thanks to cooperation with Thai Customs, the Home Office has said.",
      "When Thailand decriminalised cannabis in 2022, a surge of illegal shipments  threatened to overwhelm UK Border Force - which uncovered 15 tonnes of the drug in the post in the final quarter of last year.",

    "story": [
      "The government is no longer ruling out a youth visa deal with the EU, ahead of a summit next month to \"reset\" relations after Brexit.",
      "Labour has previously said it has \"no plans\" for such a scheme, which would make it easier for young people to study and work abroad.",
      "But an agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations between the two sides to boost co-operation. Downing Street declined to repeat its previous opposition to reporters on Thursday, saying it would not provide a \"running commentary\" on talks.",
      "It comes as over 60 Labour MPs called on ministers to strike a \"new and bespoke youth visa scheme for UK and EU citizens aged under 30\".",
      "Five key impacts of Brexit five years on",
      "EU chief 'surprised' at fish status in Brexit talks",
      "In a letter to EU relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, they argued a mutual deal for time-limited visas, subject to a cap, would \"extend new cultural, educational, and economic opportunities to young people in the UK\".",
      "Sir Keir Starmer met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later, as preparations increase for the summit in London on 19 May.",
      "Following the meeting, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"Discussing the ongoing negotiations to strengthen the UK-EU partnership, they both agreed that good progress had been made.",
      "\"They asked their teams to continue their important work in the coming weeks, with the aim of delivering as ambitious a package as possible at the first UK-EU summit next month.\"",
      "The Labour government is aiming to forge closer economic ties to the EU after Brexit. Both sides have also expressed a renewed interest in a defence and security pact amid the war in Ukraine.",
      "A defence deal would potentially unlock full UK access to a \u20ac150bn (\u00a3128bn) EU-backed loans scheme, with British firms otherwise limited to providing up to 35% of the value of projects funded under the programme.",
      "Speaking at UK Trade and Business Commission meeting on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a \"package approach\" to the talks, where different topics are linked together.",
      "He added that EU citizens had faced \"many obstacles\" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including \"very high thresholds\" for skilled work visas.",
      "Existing schemes",
      "The UK currently offers visas allowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.",
      "These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.",
      "Applicants from these countries need at least \u00a32,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of \u00a3776 for students and \u00a31,035 for workers.",
      "The European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth deal in April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking \"differential treatment\" of EU citizens.",
      "Under its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued.",
      "It also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit.",
      "'Youth experience'",
      "There have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap.",
      "Asked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that \"we have to leave that to the negotiations\".",
      "The EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa.",
      "Documents circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a \"youth experience\" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration.",
      "But any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement.",
      "During a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked \"another avenue which people might use to game the system,\" adding that Labour \"doesn't know how to negotiate\".",
      "She added: \"Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?\"",
      "Reform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a \"huge number of people\" coming to the UK, adding it would be \"completely against what the Brexit vote demanded\".",
      "An agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU.",
      "In his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have \"nothing to do with migration\" as those taking part in the scheme would \"go home\" once their visa has ended."

      "They say their plan to reform business rates will mean lower taxes for High Street businesses such as hair salons when it comes into effect in 2026-27.",
      "But salon owners fear this may come too late to save their businesses.",
      "Cutting a client's hair, Kerry explained she could not afford to take on any new apprentices this year and had been forced to reduce the hours of her current 12 apprentices to the minimum.",
      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from \u00a37,576 to \u00a318,482 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",

      "Forget the huge thwack of decisive national victory. Brace for what one former minister described as slivers of votes between five political parties, determining who wins and loses power over town halls in England, and one perch in the Commons.",
      "The results will set the political pace for the next few months. And from Friday, Reform could give the two big traditional tribes a problem, and also acquire a potential problem they haven't encountered thus far - a track record to defend.",
      "The largest parties are both likely to have a horrible time of it. Labour's wide coalition of voters went pop almost as soon as they moved into No 10.",
      "Calm heads in government say it was always going to be thus because of the state of the country when they took over. Sir Keir Starmer even told us on the record he was going to \"have to be unpopular\" \u2013 a curious ambition for a politician!",
      "But more candid insiders admit the government \"looked very unsure\" at the start. \"They didn't come in with a big project,\" one source says, and many voters took a dim view of ministers' freebies and the decision on winter fuel allowance.",

      "Labour loyalists and spin doctors will emphasise what is true \u2013 the elections being fought at council level are \"us fighting in the shires\", as one of them said.",
      "A poor performance in areas that are traditionally Tory, where the party prospered in 2021, won't be a surprise. One cabinet minister says, \"they're just not our heartlands, so we just haven't got our normal base\".",
      "But Labour could also lose mayors and there's no such excuse in what was one of their safest seats, in Runcorn, in the by-election where they could struggle to cling on.",
      "After 10 months in power, next week could show Labour how much the reality of government can really hurt.",
      "The Conservatives have also been falling over themselves to tell you just saying how awful it's going to be for them after they were, in the words of one senior figure, \"absolutely, mercilessly hammered\" back in July.",
      "The leadership says \"nowhere is safe\".  Some sources even warn in private they could lose all of the town halls they control.",
      "The concern behind the very public worry about losing hundreds and hundreds of seats is that \"we might not yet actually have hit the bottom\", in the words of another veteran.",
      "Leader Kemi Badenoch's backers continually say that rebuilding the party is a long-term project, and praise her for managing to draw at least a faint line under the toxic infighting that corroded Conservative ranks in recent years.",
      "The broad sense in Westminster is that dreadful results next week won't usher Badenoch to the door. Still, you'd be hard pressed to find a Conservative who'd happily bet their mortgage she'll definitely be in charge by the time of the next election.",
      "That's in large part because in the words of one Tory bigwig, \"she was working on the basis that it was her versus Starmer but it's not her versus Starmer,  it's her versus Starmer and Farage and Davey\".",
      "This election is pick and mix, with the newest morsels on offer coming from Nigel Farage's Reform UK. They see success in these elections as \"two or three more steps up the staircase\" towards power, says a senior figure.",
      "The other parties report Reform spending big, particularly on online advertising, focusing on national issues like immigration and net zero, and \"putting Farage out to draw a crowd\", according to a minister.",
      "Reform sources scent success. They hope they can nab Runcorn from Labour (although they aren't banking on it), but are more confident of winning mayoral races and of taking plenty of council seats.",

The Lib Dems reckon with a good night they might control more councils than the Tories this time next week \u2013 whether it's Oxfordshire or Wiltshire, Buckinghamshire or other parts of the South West.",
      "Leader Sir Ed Davey's been back in his happy place \u2013 carrying out ever more ridiculous stunts on the campaign trail, meeting hedgehogs, and even waving around packets of British pork chops on TikTok this time, (I'm not making that up).",
      "After July last year, the Lib Dems have a taste for making the Tories miserable, not just for the sake of it, but in the hope of taking out another chunk of their party's traditional infrastructure, in the shape of their county councillors.",
      "And party sources suggest their activists are more motivated, and their numbers even increasing, because of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Lastly, but not least, the Greens want to continue their steady march into council seats across England.",
      "In 2023 they had their best showing in 20 years and took majority control of a council for the first time, adding many more councillors to their number last year.",
      "This time round they want to add to the tally in counties like Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Kent, where they already have bums on seats.",
      "The Green MPs have made less noise than their other newbie rivals at the other end of the spectrum, Reform. So at a time when enthusiasm for the climate agenda has been fading, or at least evolving in both the big main parties, next week the Green Party will want to show it is a growing force.",
      "Any election is also a test of our political parties' campaign machines \u2013 the questions different for each this time round.",
      "For Labour, is it firing on all cylinders after its July triumph? Frankly, it doesn't seem to be running a campaign at full throttle this time, which given the geography of the contests, shouldn't surprise.",
      "For the Conservatives, how much of its once legendary campaigning muscle is left after getting whacked in the summer? Some loyalists are heartened there are still members willing to knock on doors. But a rival campaigner now calls them the \"tumbleweed Tories\", claiming they're nowhere to be seen on the ground.",
      "Both the Lib Dems and the Greens have long been playing effective local ground games, concentrating on building power bases in pockets of the country.",
      "The most acute test perhaps then is for Reform, who have proven time and time again they can make a lot of noise nationally, on air, and increasingly, online.",
      "In five-party politics, many races may be won with a relatively small share of the vote, by tiny margins, that \"sliver here and sliver there\".",
      "These elections are likely to result in real-life evidence of a political idea that's all the rage, that there's \"fragmentation\" among the public, the traditional voting blocs are no more. Excitable columns are already being penned in anticipation, proclaiming that two-party politics is dead.",
      "The splitting of the vote among so many groups also seems likely to leave more councils without any a clear majority.",
      "In that case, they go into what's known as \"no overall control\", so the biggest party needs votes from the others to get their way.",
      "It's likely that will pose the Conservatives with a tricky real-life question after many weeks of troublesome hypothetical arguments: will they, or won't they, work with their arch rivals Reform UK on the ground?",
      "Crucially, if Reform makes its expected big advances, it will for the first time have responsibility for decisions that affect people's lives.  That will be a big achievement.",
      "Both senior Labour and Conservative sources agree privately, as one said, \"the biggest thing to come out of Thursday night is that Reform will have a record to defend\".",
      "Next week the smaller parties are on track to have plenty to celebrate.  If the General Election was branded the \"ABC election \u2013 Anyone But the Conservatives\", maybe next week's ballots will be branded the \"ABB election \u2013 Anyone But the Big parties\".",

    "story": [
      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

    "summary": "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and April created ideal conditions for wildfires to spread.",
    "story": [
      "The area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade, satellite data suggests.",
      "More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012.",
      "That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019.",
      "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers.",
      "Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly.",
      "The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels.",
      "The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km).",
      "More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year.",
      "Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly.",
      "\"We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,\" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office.",
      "\"This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.\"",
      "A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires.",
      "\"The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,\" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London.",
      "\"Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.\"",
      "The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record.",
      "The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year.",
      "In Galloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total.",
      "A fire in mid-Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km.",
      "Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April.",
      "These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.",
      "Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.",
      "Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.",
      "Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.",
      "\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".",
      "\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"",
      "The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.",
      "But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.",
      "A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.",
      "Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.",
      "\"One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,\" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh.",

      "\"On the plus side, better weather is more inviting for us to get out and enjoy the spring. Dawn chorus is at its peak at the minute and calm, warm mornings are perfect for enjoying it,\" says Jon Carter of the BTO.",
      "The Met Office says a brief spell of warmth at the end of April isn't a bad thing for wildlife - and there shouldn't be much impact to water sources such as ponds.",
      "\"Climate change is already having a big impact on our wildlife, but a temporary blip like this is an end of April dividend for wildlife,\" says the Met Office's Grahame Madge.",
      "Some wildlife accelerates its activity with warm spring weather, so people may see natural areas near them teaming with life this coming week.",
      "Butterflies and birds may be particularly prominent, Mr Madge adds.",
      "Some studies suggest warm weather means birds can breed earlier in the year and do not need to incubate their young for as long.",
      "Migratory birds - such as swallows and swifts - that return to the UK because there are more insects to feed on in warmer climes, may be coming back sooner. The Met Office says a swallow was reported in southern England before March this year.",
      "Warm weather can also see butterflies emerge. Hotter days earlier in the year can bring out red admirals, previously an exclusively migratory insect.",
      "The peacock and small tortoiseshell are among the first to spread their wings, with more butterflies emerging from April onwards.",
      "Dragonflies start to be seen around this time, too.",
      "There could also be some sightings of rare visitors such as the exotic European bee-eater, which have recently begun nesting in the UK.",
      "Wildlife charities say it's a great time to get out and about and enjoy nature, but people should be on their guard against accidentally starting a fire.",
      "Oliver Fry of Surrey Wildlife Trust says conditions are incredibly dry on the heathlands of Surrey, which creates \"tinderbox conditions\".",
      "The wild, flat landscapes dotted with gorse and heather are known for their wildlife, including rare species like the sand lizard, woodlark and silver-studded blue butterfly.",
      "Earlier this month, conservationists warned that some of the UK's rarest wildlife is being \"torched alive\" and pushed closer to extinction after weeks of intense grass fires.",
      "Anne McCall, director of RSPB Scotland, says climate change is driving more regular wildfires of greater intensity, and especially so in spring.",
      "\"It is not just vegetation that gets destroyed by wildfire,\" she says. \"This is a critical time of year for our native wildlife \u2013 with birds nesting and other animals such as amphibians and reptiles coming out of winter dormancy and starting to breed.\"",
      "On the coasts, conservation experts say there has been a crop of sightings of whales and dolphins close to British shores \u2013 and though it's difficult to pin down a reason, warming seas and climate change are likely to be a factor.",
      "\"Seeing whales and dolphins in the wild is always an awesome experience but seeing more of them, and more unusual species around UK coast may not be such a good thing,\" says Danny Groves from the charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation.",
      "Heatwaves and increases in sea temperatures can cause some whales to roam far from their usual areas just to survive, he adds.",

      "Donald Trump has signed a controversial executive order aimed at stepping up deep-sea mining within US and in international waters.",
      "The move to allow exploration outside its national waters has been met by condemnation from China which said it \"violates\" international law.",
      "Thursday's order is the latest issued by the US president to try to increase America's access to minerals used by the aerospace, green technology and healthcare sectors.",

      "Deep-sea mining tech advances but doubts remain",
      "The latest US executive order was issued to \"establish the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration\", it reads.",
      "The move appears to bypass a long-running round of UN negotiations on mining in international waters.",
      "Many countries, including China, have delayed issuing permits until countries agreed a framework for how resources could be shared.",
      "\"The US authorisation... violates international law and harms the overall interests of the international community,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Friday.",
      "China dominates global production of rare earths and critical metals like cobalt and lithium.",
      "Trump has been frustrated by this relative weakness of the US position, analysts say.",
      "\"We want the US to get ahead of China in this resource space under the ocean, on the ocean bottom,\" a US official said on Thursday.",
      "To achieve this, the order says the US will speed up the process of issuing exploration licences and recovery permits both in its own waters and in \"areas beyond national jurisdiction\".",
      "The administration estimates that deep-sea mining could boost the country's GDP by $300bn (\u00a3225bn) over 10 years and create 100,000 jobs",
      "The EU, the UK and others support a moratorium on the practice until further scientific research is carried out.",
      "Environmentalists and scientists are concerned that marine species living in the deep sea could be harmed by the process.",
      "\"Deep-sea mining is a deeply dangerous endeavour for our ocean,\" said Jeff Watters of Ocean Conservancy, a US-based environmental group.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.",
      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",
      "In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.",
      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xz664r2do",
    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:00:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",

      "The world's rainforests are often referred to as the \"lungs of the earth\".",
      "They store billions of tonnes of carbon and in doing so help to reduce the impacts of climate change.",
      "But with more than one and half trillion trees, measuring exactly how much carbon they store has been virtually impossible, until now.",
      "On Tuesday, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched a first-of-a-kind satellite which uses a special radar system to reveal what lies beneath the canopy.",
      "It is hoped it will help scientists better understand the importance of rainforests in storing carbon and the impact of deforestation.",
      "World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030",
      "Deforestation surges in 2022 despite pledges",
      "The rocket took off from ESA's Kourou station in French Guiana and flying over the Amazon, one of the rainforests it will study.",
      "The satellite on board has been affectionately named \"space brolly\" for its giant 12m diameter antenna which will send out signals.",
      "\"We really want to interrogate these forests. We can actually look inside,\" Prof John Remedios, director of The National Centre for Earth Observation, which proposed the idea to ESA, said after the launch.",
      "He said that it would be a major achievement \"to actually know for the first time with high accuracy how much is actually in the Amazon, Congo, Indonesia\".",
      "The antenna is using P-band radar which has a very long wavelength - allowing it to see deeper inside forests and reveal branches and trunks obscured by the canopy.",
      "\"Most radars that we have in space today take wonderful images of icebergs, but when they look at forests they see the tops of the forest, the little twigs, the little leaves, they don't penetrate down into the forests,\" explained Dr Ralph Cordey, head of geosciences at Airbus.",
      "\"But what we found was that by using a much longer radar wavelength, we could see down into the depths of trees and forests,\" he said.",
      "The 1.2-tonne satellite will use an approach not dissimilar to that used in a CT scan, and analyse slices through the trees on repeat passes to build up a picture of how much woody material is present.",
      "It is this material that can be used as a proxy for the amount of planet-warming carbon dioxide stored.",
      "Currently scientists have been measuring individual trees and trying to extrapolate, but this presents a \"huge challenge\" said Prof Mat Disney, professor of remote sensing, at University College London.",
      "\"Our current understanding is really patchy, because it's really, really difficult to measure,\" he said. \"Essentially, what we're talking about is trying to weigh the amount of carbon that's stored in one and a half trillion trees across the tropics.",
      "\"Satellites are really the only way you can do that consistently.\"",
      "On the ground measurements will continue to take place after the satellite is launched to verify the data it is sending back.",
      "The satellite was built in the UK and first conceived by University of Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan, but he said it was an international effort: \"The mission is the culmination of decades of highly innovative work in partnership with some of the best scientists in Europe and the US.\"",
      "Despite decades of testing, the deployment of the satellite has many challenging stages beyond the rocket launch.",
      "\"Certain things on the satellite are big, that includes its big 12-metre, deployable antenna. It's a bit like deploying an umbrella in space, only a very big one, so we will be looking for that to happen smoothly,\" said Dr Cordey.",
      "Airbus brought in engineers from the American company L3Harris Technologies to their site in Stevenage to oversee the construction of the antenna-reflector.",
      "L3Harris are specialists in these large, unfurlable systems - expertise which is not currently possessed in Europe.",
      "The team is hoping to produce the first maps within six months, and will then continue to gather data for the next five years.",
      "These annual maps will not only show how much carbon is stored but how much is being lost through deforestation.",
      "\"The kind of observations that we've had for 50 years from [other] satellites like Landsat are affected very heavily by clouds. And in tropical regions, we have clouds a lot of the time, so you may not see a chunk of tropical forest,\" said Prof Disney.",
      "Another advantage of the longer wavelength of the Biomass satellite is that it can penetrate clouds giving a consistent, comparable view of a forest from one year to the next.",
      "It is this outcome which has motivated the scientists who have worked on the project for more than 20 years.",
      "\"It's exciting, because it's going to tell us about how something that we perhaps take for granted,\" said Dr Cordey. \"Our forests, our trees, how they are contributing to the processes which govern our planet, and in particular, the processes behind climate change which are so important to us today and for the future.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",

      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",

      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",

    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have reprogrammed a robot vacuum cleaner to help charge a phone and assist in a home workout because they think the machines are currently too \"idle\".",
      "Researchers from the University of Bath say the increasingly popular domestic appliances are, on average, in use for less than two hours per day, but could be working considerably harder - with some modifications.",
      "To prove their point, they retrained a Roomba device to carry out a range of other chores, and outlined many more possible tasks it could do such as playing with a cat and watering the plants.",
      "Such robots \"are perceived as limited, single-task devices but there is a strong argument that they are under-used for practical tasks\", said Yoshiaki Shiokawa, the author of the study.",
      "The global household robots market size was valued at $10.3bn (\u00a37.7bn) in 2023 and is anticipated to hit $24.5bn by 2028, meaning such devices are an increasingly common sight in people's homes.",
      "Anyone who has watched a robot vacuum cleaner in action may argue these ideas are a little far-fetched, given that current machines sometimes struggle with the challenges presented by rugs and shoelaces while carrying out their core function.",
      "However, scientists from the University of Bath and the University of Calgary in Canada, have set out to prove that cleaners - and similar devices, such as lawnmowers - could be reprogrammed and modified relatively easily.",
      "Their study identified 100 functions the robots could possibly perform with simple adjustments.",
      "The scientists then reprogrammed a Roomba robot vacuum cleaner to perform four of them:",
      "A mobile phone charger attached to the vacuum that is programmed to follow the userA robot with a projector attached that displayed a workout video on a wall or ceilingA 'home monitor' with live video so a user could check on the ovenA screen showing 'do not disturb' on a robot that was programmed to go to a specific location, to help minimise possible disturbances",

      "A screen showing 'do not disturb' on a robot that was programmed to go to a specific location, to help minimise possible disturbances",
      "Other proposed tasks suggested by the scientists include a reprogrammed robot that carried the groceries from the car to the kitchen.",
      "Mr Shiokawa, a PhD student in the department of computer science at Bath, said the project proved that \"after making minimal adjustments, a Roomba can serve multiple roles around the home\".",
      "\"For most of the day, they sit idle\", he lamented.",
      "He added that taking on some new tasks involved some upgrades the average vacuum owner probably would not have lying around their homes, such as a cart, a helmet and a robotic arm.",
      "Nonetheless, he said people should be expecting more of their robots.",
      "\"We should be extending their utility beyond their primary tasks by programming them to physically navigate the home to perform a range of additional functions,\" he said.",
      "The study's co-author Dr Adwait Sharma agreed, saying the device's \"idle time\" presented \"unique opportunities\" to meet the \"growing need for adaptable robots and integrated systems that can seamlessly fit into our daily lives\"."

      "Marks and Spencer (M&S) customers have been telling the BBC of their frustration as disruption caused by the cyber attack which has hit the retailer continues into another trading week.",
      "The incident - which it disclosed last Monday - has caused delayed parcels, paused online orders and suspended gift card payments, and has seen the retailer take down several parts of its operations over the last few days.",
      "It has yet to disclose the nature of the cyber attack or when it expects operations to return to normal. Some customers told the BBC that M&S' communication over affected orders has been \"disappointing\".",
      "Analysts warn the incident may affect the retailer's reputation.",
      "Customers have been telling the BBC of the impact the situation is having on them.",
      "Linda Sonntag, who lives in Norwich, told the BBC she was left \"disappointed\" after a flower delivery arranged for a friend never arrived.",
      "She told the BBC she was still awaiting a refund and email with information about her order.",
      "\"In the meantime I've had to order flowers from somewhere else,\" she said.",
      "\"I don't blame them, they've had a cyber attack,\" Ms Sonntag added.",
      "\"But I don't think their attitude towards their customers is very helpful.\"",
      "Dawn Cunnington, of Exeter, agreed the company was not to blame, but said she had no communication from M&S about her own flower order not being fulfilled.",
      "She had ordered flowers on Wednesday, on behalf of her 91-year-old mother, for her mother's friend, who was celebrating their 90th birthday.",
      "\"I'd had nothing from them until I phoned up,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Ms Cunnington said she received a refund and a \u00a310 apology voucher after calling M&S to find out what happened to the flowers, but was \"a bit cross\" they had allowed her to place the order in the first place, given it was aware of cyber incident.",
      "Other customers have described having to cancel orders for clothes which they were expecting to collect before going on holiday, or being unable to return goods they had previously bought.",
      "But some have expressed sympathy for the staff at the stores, who they say have been on the receiving end of abuse from angry customers, or having to deal with shopping abandoned at the tills when customers were unable to pay when contactless payments were down.",
      "Working round the clock",
      "M&S remains silent on how the cyber attack unfolded, the nature of the attack and how specifically it has been affected by it - leaving cyber security experts to speculate as to what might have happened.",
      "It is known it has hired external cyber security experts, who are likely to be a team of incident response specialists who will be working around the clock either at the headquarters of the company or remotely.",
      "Their first priority is likely to be find out where the hackers are in the IT system and kick them out.",
      "Switching off computer servers used in their online ordering, payment or logistics systems might imply that security teams have isolated that portion as a way the hackers gained entry.",
      "They might also have taken these offline to stop the hackers from spreading their malicious software into those previously unaffected areas.",
      "It might also be the case that the company is taking all non-business critical services offline to help deal with the hack.",
      "\"In situations like this, in-store services are typically prioritised for recovery, which can mean online operations take slightly longer to restore,\" said Sam Kirkman, a director at cyber-security firm NetSPI.",
      "He told the BBC that while M&S taking steps like pausing services may make the incident seem \"even more serious from the outside,\" they would allow staff to contain any potential threats and begin recovery safely.",
      "Reputational risk",
      "About a third of M&S's clothing and household goods' sales in the UK are through its online platforms and were worth some \u00a31.268bn in latest published financial results.",
      "Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said even though M&S's physical stores were still open, many of them \"simply don't stock the popular ranges from online\".",
      "She added clothes sales were \"likely to take a big hit\" as the cyber-attack had occurred during a spell of warm weather when summer ranges would be \"piling up in virtual baskets\".",
      "Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said M&S's success was \"built on trust\" - and this was something customers may question after it suspended online orders.",
      "\"The longer it takes to draw a line under the cyber incident, the greater the risk to Marks & Spencer's reputation,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Shoppers want to know that their personal and financial details are safe when buying goods online and Marks & Spencer failing to give the all-clear implies that something is very wrong at its end.\"",

    "summary": "Bug hunters make money by funding flaws in software, but AI is changing the way they work.",
    "story": [
      "Few technology careers offer the chance to demonstrate your skills in exclusive venues worldwide, from luxury hotels to Las Vegas e-sports arenas, peers cheering you on as your name moves up the leaderboard and your earnings rack up.",
      "But that's what Brandyn Murtagh experienced within his first year as a bug bounty hunter.",
      "Mr Murtagh got into gaming and building computers at 10 or 11-years-old and always knew \"I wanted to be a hacker or work in security\".",
      "He began working in a security operations centre at 16, and moved into penetration testing at 20, a job that also involved testing the security of clients' physical and computer security: \"I had to forge false identities and break into places and then hack. Quite fun.\"",
      "But in the past year he has became a full-time bug hunter and independent security researcher, meaning he scours organizations' computer infrastructure for security vulnerabilities. And he hasn't looked back.",
      "Internet browser pioneer Netscape is regarded as the first technology company to offer a cash \"bounty\" to security researchers or hackers for uncovering flaws or vulnerabilities in its products, back in the 1990s.",
      "Eventually platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne in the US, and Intigriti in Europe, emerged to connect hackers and organizations that wanted their software and systems tested for security vulnerabilities.",
      "As Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis explains, while hacking is a \"morally agnostic skill set\", bug hunters do have to operate within the law.",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd bring more discipline to the bug-hunting process, allowing companies to set the \"scope\" of what systems they want hackers to target. And they operate those live hackathons where top bug hunters compete and collaborate \"hammering\" systems, showing off their skills and potentially earning big money.",
      "The payoff for companies using platforms like Bugcrowd is also clear. Andre Bastert, global product manager AXIS OS, at Swedish network camera and surveillance equipment firm Axis Communications, said that with 24 million lines of code in its device operating system, vulnerabilities are inevitable. \"We realized it's always good to have a second set of eyes.\"",
      "Platforms like Bugcrowd mean \"you can use hackers as a force for good,\" he says. Since opening its bug bounty programme, Axis has uncovered \u2013 and patched - as many as 30 vulnerabilities, says Mr Bastert, including one \"we deem very severe\". The hacker responsible received a $25,000 (\u00a319,300) reward.",
      "So, it can be lucrative work. Bugcrowd's top earning hacker over the last year earned over $1.2m.",
      "But while there are millions of hackers registered on the key platforms, Inti De Ceukelaire, chief hacking officer at Intigriti, says the number hunting on a daily or weekly basis is \"tens of thousands.\" The elite tier, who are invited to the flagship live events will be smaller still.",
      "Mr Murtagh says: \"A good month would look like a couple of critical vulnerabilities found, a couple of highs, a lot of mediums. Some good pay days in an ideal situation.\" But he adds, \"It doesn't always happen.\"",
      "Yet with the explosion of AI, bug hunters have whole new attack surfaces to explore.",
      "Mr Ellis says organizations are racing to gain a competitive advantage with the technology. And this typically has a security impact.",
      "\"In general, if you implement a new technology quickly and competitively, you're not thinking as much about what might go wrong.\" In addition, he says, AI is not just powerful but \"designed to be used by anyone\".",
      "Dr Katie Paxton-Fear, a security researcher and cybersecurity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, points out that AI is the first technology to explode onto the scene with the formal bug hunting community already in place.",
      "And it has levelled the playing field for hackers, says Mr De Ceukelaire. Hackers \u2013 both ethical and not \u2013 can exploit the technology to speed up and automate their own operations. This ranges from conducting reconnaissance to identify vulnerable systems, to analysing code for flaws or suggesting possible passwords to break into systems.",
      "But modern AI systems' reliance on large language models also means language skills and manipulation are an important part of the hacker tool kit, Mr De Ceukelaire says.",
      "He says he has drawn on classic police interrogation techniques to befuddle chatbots and get them to \"crack\".",
      "Mr Murtagh describes using such social engineering techniques on chatbots for retailers: \"I would try and make the chatbot cause a request or even trigger itself to give me another user's order or another user's data.\"",
      "But these systems are also vulnerable to more \"traditional\" web app techniques, he says. \"I have had some success in an attack called cross site scripting, where you can essentially trick the chatbot into rendering a malicious payload that can cause all kinds of security implications.\"",
      "But the threat doesn't stop there. Dr Paxton-Fear says an over-focus on chatbots and large language models can distract from the broader interconnectedness of AI powered systems.",
      "\"If you get a vulnerability in one system, where does that eventually appear in every other system it connects to? Where are we seeing that link between them? That's where I would be looking for these kinds of flaws.\"",
      "Dr Paxton-Fear adds that there hasn't been a major AI-related data breach yet, but \"I think it's just a matter of time\".",
      "In the meantime, the burgeoning AI industry needs to be sure it embraces bug hunters and security researchers, she says. \"The fact that some companies don't makes it so much harder for us to do our job of just keeping the world safe.\"",
      "That is unlikely to put off the bug hunters in the meantime. As Mr De Ceukelaire says: \"Once a hacker, always a hacker.\"",

      "Satellite images further reveal that the Turkish military has built at least 660km (410 miles) of roads connecting its facilities. These supply routes have resulted in deforestation and left a lasting imprint on the region's mountains.",

      "Romanians are returning to the polls this weekend, following the unprecedented cancellation of presidential elections last December which fuelled protests and nationwide turmoil.",
      "Far-right candidate Calin Georgescu's shock victory in the first round of elections was annulled amid accusations of Russian interference, suspicious TikTok accounts and secret payments to online influencers. Moscow denied interfering in the election.",
      "Georgescu is now banned from running, and was detained, facing a criminal investigation including attempting to overthrow constitutional order. He has denied the charges and accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify stealing the election\".",
      "The leader of Romania's far-right AUR party, George Simion, has been polling as the frontrunner in the first round of the election re-run on Sunday.",
      "He is followed in the polls by Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party and independent candidate Nicu\u0219or Dan.",
      "At the centre of this unprecedented political crisis are TikTok influencers accused by the Romanian authorities of participating in social media campaigns which artificially boosted Georgescu's online presence. The BBC has spoken to some of them.",
      "Protesters took to the streets in March, after it was announced Georgescu couldn't run in the May elections.",
      "What happened on TikTok?",
      "Pro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu's victory in the first round of elections came as a surprise.",
      "Georgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%.",
      "He declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning.",
      "Instead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote.",
      "An independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\".",
      "Authorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign.",
      "The authorities said that one of these campaigns was \"identical\" to an operation \"run by the Russian Federation in Ukraine\".",
      "Separately, declassified intelligence documents also stated that Russia carried out \"cyberattacks, leaks, and sabotage\" in Romania.",
      "But authorities still haven't provided any concrete evidence of Russian interference in the election, frustrating many Romanians.",
      "The Foreign Intelligence Services and Romanian Police declined to comment on ongoing investigations.",
      "Calin Georgescu has been barred from running in May's re-run of the election",
      "Influencer campaign",
      "Shortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\".",
      "They did not name a specific candidate.",
      "They had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it.",
      "FameUp declined to comment to the BBC.",
      "Cristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\".",
      "Some influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned.",
      "While the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescu\u2026 I was absolutely surprised.\"",
      "The comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\".",
      "It is still not clear who created these bot accounts.",
      "Experts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\".",
      "\"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said.",
      "The uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January.",
      "The Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections.",
      "In response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu.",
      "Romeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents",
      "'TikTok King'",
      "Then, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money.",
      "The prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts.",
      "His lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\".",
      "We spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts.",
      "He says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok \u2013 along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle \u2013 have been removed.",
      "Elgi says his content wasn't about the election, but about manele music, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu.",
      "Elgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\"",
      "Much is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election.",
      "It's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity.",
      "\"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\"",

      "In a grand courtroom adorned with 19th Century tapestries, the court was given a fascinating snapshot into the lives of the diverse cast of characters suspected of involvement in the heist.",
      "For the first one up - 71-year-old Yunice Abbas - this was done through a \"enqu\u00eate de personnalit\u00e9\", a sort of background report on a person accused of a crime which French courts regularly include in their trials. These reports take in elements of the defendant's family history, behaviour and work to paint a picture of their lives and help jurors make a decision.",
      "The court heard a long list of crimes that Abbas has been found guilty of in the past - from petty crime and small-time drug trafficking to bank robberies - and retraced his difficult childhood, which was partly spent in Algeria and marked by the deaths of two of his siblings.",
      "Abbas - who has spent almost a third of his life in jail - has already admitted to his role in the heist, and even wrote a memoir entitled I Held Up Kim Kardashian. The president of the court, David De Pas, suggested that the book shows Abbas was proud of what he did - something he has repeatedly denied.",
      "When asked if he had any sympathy for his victims, Abbas said that he never did before the Kardashian heist, \"but this time I do regret what I did\u2026 It opened my eyes.\"",
      "Abbas said that while watching television in jail, he was confronted with relentless coverage of the burglary, which made him realise how much Kim Kardashian had suffered.",
      "\"We just grabbed the lady's handbag but I have discovered there's trauma behind it,\" he said.",
      "The court also focused on Gary Madar, whose brother's company provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for several years. Now 35, the father-of-two has been accused of feeding information to the gang about Kim Kardashian's location on the night of the heist.",
      "At the time, Gary worked as a customer service agent in airports for the transport company. His task was to welcome VIPs arriving at Paris airports and escort them through passport and customs checks. Through this job, he met the Kardashians several times.",
      "But he also worked at a caf\u00e9 owned by another defendant, Florus H\u00e9roui, 52, to whom investigators believe Madar passed on information about Kim Kardashian.",
      "He has denied this and his lawyer has told the BBC that Madar should not be on the dock as there is \"no solid proof\" of his involvement.",
      "Marc Boyer, 78, who is accused of supplying the weapon that was used to threaten Kardashian, was also questioned at length. He expressed regret that his son Marc-Alexandre Boyer - also a defendant - had grown up surrounded by \"thieves\" and \"crooks\" who had led him to make the wrong life choices.",
      "The rest of the week will see more defendants take the stand as the trial ticks on towards 13 May - the day Kim Kardashian is expected to testify.",

      "Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and author of a book on the robbery, told the BBC that Paris courts were busy with large terrorism trials for several years, which created a backlog.",

    "summary": "Assad al-Nassasra was missing for weeks following last month's attack, in which 15 emergency workers were killed by Israeli troops.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli military has released a Palestinian paramedic detained when Israeli troops killed 15 other emergency workers in southern Gaza last month, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said.",
      "Assad al-Nassasra was missing for three weeks until the International Committee of the Red Cross received information he was in Israeli detention.",
      "He was reportedly one of 10 detainees freed at an Israeli border crossing with Gaza on Tuesday.",
      "The Israeli military has not commented. But it had confirmed it was holding Mr Nassasra during a briefing on an internal inquiry into the attack, which identified \"several professional failures\".",
      "The PRCS denounced the findings as an attempt to justify a \"war crime\".",
      "Palestinian Red Crescent says Israeli report into Gaza medics' killings 'full of lies'",
      "'Professional failures' led to killing of Gaza medics, IDF inquiry says",
      "Gaza medic missing since deadly attack being detained by Israel, Red Cross says",
      "Eight PRCS paramedics, six first responders from Gaza's Civil Defence agency, and one employee of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) were killed when their ambulances, a fire engine and a UN vehicle came under fire in the Tal al-Sultan area of Rafah during an emergency call-out early on 23 March.",
      "Their bodies were found buried in shallow graves a week later next to the crushed vehicles.",
      "One other PRCS paramedic survived and said he was released by Israeli forces after being detained alongside Mr Nassasra.",
      "The Israeli military initially said its troops fired on \"suspicious vehicles\" driving in darkness with their headlights and emergency lights off.",
      "But it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of one of the dead paramedics - Rifaat Radwan, who was in the same ambulance as Mr Nassasra - showed the convoy was using its emergency lights.",
      "At the end of the video, the ambulances are seen having pulled over on the roadside. The sound of gunfire can then be heard just as Radwan gets out of his ambulance. It continues for more than five minutes and Radwan is heard saying his last prayers, before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching.",
      "On 20 April, the military released a summary of its internal inquiry which said the shooting of the 14 PRCS and Civil Defence workers resulted from \"an operational misunderstanding\" by troops from a reconnaissance battalion \"who believed they faced a tangible threat\".",
      "It found the killing of the Unrwa employee meanwhile \"involved a breach of orders during a combat setting\".",
      "The military said the deputy commander of the reconnaissance battalion was dismissed \"due to his responsibilities as the field commander in this incident and for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief\".",
      "The PRCS condemned the report, saying it was evidence of what it called Israel's \"policy of systemic distortion of the truth\" to protect its soldiers from accountability.",
      "\"The results of the occupation's investigation hold the usual fallacious allegations of rescue teams in Gaza being part of Hamas in order to justify the war crime of targeting medical missions in general, and the war crime of attacking teams and vehicles carrying the protected emblems of the Geneva Conventions in particular,\" it said.",
      "A senior UN humanitarian official in Gaza warned \"a lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place\".",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",
      "At least 52,365 people have been killed in Gaza during the ensuing war, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "The ministry says more than 2,270 people have been killed since Israel resumed its offensive on 18 March after the collapse of a two-month ceasefire, saying it was putting pressure on Hamas to release the 59 hostages it is still holding.",
      "Palestinian media reported on Tuesday that at least six people were killed in Israeli air and artillery strikes across Gaza City, in the north, including three in the al-Shaaf area.",
      "Another four people were said to have been killed in strikes on tents housing displaced people in the southern al-Mawasi area, near the city of Khan Younis.",
      "Israel has also blocked all deliveries of humanitarian aid and other supplies to Gaza since 2 March, which the UN says has caused severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.",
      "On Tuesday, the UN's human rights chief urged the world to \"prevent the total collapse of critical life-saving support in Gaza\".",
      "\"Any use of starvation of the civilian population as a method of war constitutes a war crime, and so do all forms of collective punishment,\" Volker T\u00fcrk warned.",
      "The UN has said Israel is obliged under international law to ensure supplies for the 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "But Israel has said it is complying with international law and that there is no shortage of aid because 25,000 lorry loads entered Gaza during the recent ceasefire. It has also accused Hamas of stealing supplies, which the group has denied."

    "summary": "The escalation in tensions means it could be years before tourism and businesses thrive again in Kashmir.",
    "story": [
      "One week after a devastating militant attack near the mountain resort of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir killed 26 people, the town wears a look of quiet desolation, although tourists have begun trickling back in small numbers.",
      "The main high street, abandoned by visitors last week - with shops shuttered and hotels completely emptied out - is seeing fleeting signs of life again.",
      "Last Tuesday, militants opened fire on people, mostly tourists, who were visiting Baisaran, a mountain-top meadow three miles (5 km) from Pahalgam, often described as the \"Switzerland of India\".",
      "The attack was one of the deadliest in recent years, devastating the lives of many families and sparking widespread anger in India.",
      "In the days since, tensions between India and Pakistan, which both claim Kashmir in full but administer it only in part, have significantly risen, with each side announcing retaliatory measures against the other.",
      "There is now growing speculation about whether there will be a military response from Delhi. The government in Kashmir has closed down over half the tourist destinations in the valley, as authorities review the security situation and carry out search operations.",
      "While violence has often broken out in the region, with militants targeting security forces and civilians since an insurgency broke out in 1989, the brazen killing of tourists has been rare and has shocked local businesses and tourists alike.",
      "Tourism is a mainstay of the economy in places like Pahalgam and there's now fear that many livelihoods might be irrevocably hit.",
      "At a \"selfie point\" outside town, overlooking lush meadows and a rushing river, Akshay Solanki, a tourist from Mumbai, said there was \"panic\" among his group of travellers on the day of the attack. But they had decided to continue with their journey because flights back home had become unaffordable.",
      "Other tourists said constant reassurances from the locals and security forces had given them a sense of comfort. A driver who had brought visitors from the capital, Srinagar, told BBC Hindi that he was pleading with those visiting not to \"distance\" themselves from Kashmir.",
      "After a washout three days, shawl-seller Rafi Ahmed said he'd managed to sell just a few pieces and feared for his livelihood in the long run if tourists stopped coming.",
      "Among those exhorting tourists to come to Pahalgam was Bollywood actor Atul Kulkarni, who visited the town days after the attack. He told BBC Hindi, if the message from the militants was \"don't come here, we should respond by coming in even larger numbers\".",
      "\"Don't cancel bookings, cancel your other plans and come here,\" Kulkarni said.",
      "But uncertainty and apprehension loom large in Pahalgam and it could take several years before a sense of normalcy is restored, local business owners and residents told the BBC.",
      "Indian authorities have launched combing operations in the region, detaining hundreds of people and destroying homes belonging to alleged militants.",
      "India and Pakistan have also reportedly exchanged small arms fire across the border.",
      "The escalation in tensions is keeping tourists and business owners on tenterhooks.",
      "Indian authorities have often claimed Kashmir witnessed a period of relative peace after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked its autonomous status in 2019. Ahead of India's general elections in 2024, Modi hailed the \"freedom\" that had come to the region, saying Kashmir was touching new heights of development because it was breathing freely.",
      "Top leaders pointed to high tourism numbers - some 23 million last year and millions more in the years before - as proof of a big boom after years of unquiet. But last week's attacks have, yet again, shattered any idea of lasting peace in the restive valley.",
      "\"This [attack] is a blot on us\u2026How we wipe it off is a long-term concern,\" Rafi Ahmed Meer, a politician from Pahalgam told BBC Hindi, urging tourists to remember that it was local Kashmiris who rushed to help after the attacks, even picking up bodies.",
      "The cancellation rate for trips planned from cities like Pune, Mumbai and Bengaluru are very high, Abhishek Sansare, a Mumbai-based tour operator told the BBC. A group of prominent tour operators said in a press conference that some 80-90% of all bookings had been cancelled.",
      "\"After the attack, there's a sense that a war is looming. So tourists are confused about what to do,\" said Sansare. \"Some of those who've already made advance bookings are going ahead with their plans. I'm also going there on the 2nd of next month.\"",
      "The attack on tourists is also likely to weigh on Kashmir in other ways. The inauguration of the world's highest single-arch rail bridge, set to connect the Kashmir valley with the rest of India was slated to happen this month after several delays.",
      "The timeline for the opening of this showpiece project now \"looks uncertain\", a source told the BBC.",
      "The region was just beginning to attract fledgling business investments, but those too could dry up if hostilities go up.",
      "\"People who were investing in logistics and other sectors will now think twice because of the security environment. Until they regain some confidence, I don't foresee investments coming to Kashmir immediately,\" said Ubair Shah, who owns one of Kashmir's largest cold storage facilities for fruits in Pulwama district in south Kashmir.",
      "As the region continues to boil over, local leaders have expressed deep anguish to the families who lost their loved ones.",
      "In an impassioned speech in the Jammu and Kashmir assembly on Monday, the state's chief minister and tourism minister Omar Abdullah paid tributes to the victims by reading out names of all the 26 people.",
      "He said people from every part of the country had come under attack, and while they'd come to Kashmir at his invitation he could not ensure their safe return.",
      "\"I had no words to apologise to them. What could I say to the children who saw their father drenched in blood? To the widow of the navy officer who was married barely a few days ago?",
      "\"Some people told me they'd come to Kashmir for the first time, but will have to pay for their holiday life long,\" he said, adding that the attack had \"hollowed out\" Kashmir."

    "story": [
      "At least 68 African migrants have been killed in a US air strike on a detention centre in Houthi-controlled north-western Yemen, the armed group's TV channel says.",
      "Al Masirah reported that another 47 migrants were injured, most of them critically, when the centre in Saada province was bombed. It posted graphic footage showing multiple bodies covered in the rubble of a destroyed building.",
      "A US defence official said the US military's Central Command was aware of the claims of civilian casualties.",
      "The strike came hours after Central Command announced its forces had hit more than 800 targets since President Donald Trump ordered an intensification of the air campaign against the Houthis on 15 March.",
      "It said the strikes had \"killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders\", including senior officials overseeing missile and drone programmes.",
      "Houthi-run authorities have said the strikes have killed dozens of civilians, but they have reported few casualties among the group's members.",
      "Who are the Houthis and why is the US targeting them?",
      "Hundreds of migrants killed by Saudi border guards - report",
      "'We make it or we die'",
      "The migrant detention centre in Saada was reportedly holding 115 Africans when it was hit four times shortly before 05:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Monday, according to Al Masirah.",
      "The casualty reports could not be immediately verified, but Al Masirah's videos showed first responders recovering the bodies of at least a dozen men among pieces of concrete and metal debris on the floor of a large building with partially destroyed walls and no roof.",
      "At a local hospital, another injured man told Al Masirah: \"The strike hit us while we were sleeping, that's it.\"",
      "Following a visit to the scene, the chairman of the Somali community in Yemen,  Ibrahim Cabdulqaadir Macallin, told the BBC: \"It was tragic and horrific... I saw burnt people. We couldn't recognise some of the bodies we saw.\"",
      "He said the number of Somali migrants who were killed was \"very small\" because a group had been removed from the detention centre three days earlier, and that the majority of the detainees were Ethiopians.",
      "He also said that the facility was in an \"open area\" and \"not near any military base\".",
      "The Houthi-run interior ministry condemned what it called the \"deliberate bombing\" of the facility and said it constituted a \"war crime\".",
      "The US defence official said Central Command took the claims of civilian casualties very seriously, and that it was currently conducting a battle-damage assessment and inquiry into them.",
      "The UN's International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was \"deeply saddened by the reports of the tragic loss of life in Saada\".",
      "\"While IOM has not been operating at this facility, we remain committed to closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to offer support as needed,\" it added.",
      "\"We call on all parties to the conflict to prioritize the protection of civilians and ensure full respect for international laws.\"",
      "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said teams from the Yemen Red Crescent Society provided lifesaving support by evacuating the wounded to hospitals and were ensuring a dignified management of the dead.",
      "In 2022, at least 66 people were reportedly killed when the Saudi-led coalition supporting Yemen's government struck a pre-trial detention facility only 100m (330ft) away from the location of Monday's attack.",
      "Al Masirah also reported that another eight people had been killed in overnight US air strikes in the Houthi-controlled capital, Sanaa.",
      "The statement put out by Centcom late on Sunday said the US had \"intentionally limited disclosing details of our ongoing or future operations\" in order to \"preserve operational security\".",
      "Despite the devastation and humanitarian crisis in Yemen caused by 11 years of conflict, migrants continue to arrive in the country by boat from the Horn of Africa, motivated by political and economic instability, droughts and other extreme weather events in their own countries.",
      "Most of them are intending to cross into neighbouring Saudi Arabia to find work. Instead, they face exploitation, detention, violence, and dangerous journeys through active conflict zones, according to the IOM.",
      "In 2024 alone, it says, almost 60,900 migrants arrived in the country, often with no means to survive. The majority of them are Ethiopians and Somalis.",
      "Thousands of migrants are thought to be held in detention centres like the one in Saada, but there are no official statistics from the Houthi-run authorities. Rights groups say detainees experience dire conditions, including overcrowding, abuse and poor sanitation.",
      "Earlier this month, the Houthi-run government said a series of US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal on the Red Sea coast killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others. It said the terminal was a civilian facility and that the strikes constituted a \"war crime\".",
      "Centcom said the attack destroyed the ability of Ras Isa to accept fuel and that it would \"begin to impact Houthi ability to not only conduct operations, but also to generate millions of dollars in revenue for their terror activities\".",
      "Last month, Trump ordered large-scale strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis and threatened that they would be \"completely annihilated\". He also warned Iran not to arm the group - something it has repeatedly denied doing.",
      "On Sunday, Centcom said it would \"continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region\".",
      "On Monday evening, the Houthis' military spokesman said its forces had retaliated for the US \"aggression and massacres against civilians\" by targeting the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier battle group with \"a number of cruise and ballistic missiles and drones\".",
      "He also said the group had launched a drone towards the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israel's military announced earlier that it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen.",
      "Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members.",
      "The Houthis have said they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.",
      "The Houthis were not deterred by the deployment of Western warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden to protect merchant vessels last year, or by multiple rounds of US strikes on military targets ordered by former President Joe Biden.",
      "After taking office in January, Trump redesignated the Houthis as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" - a status the Biden administration had removed due to what it said was the need to mitigate the country's humanitarian crisis.",
      "Yemen has been devastated by a civil war, which escalated in 2015 when the Houthis seized control of the country's north-west from the internationally-recognised government, and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US intervened in an effort to restore its rule.",
      "The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered a humanitarian disaster, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid."

      "\"Conservation expertise has been sought in the Netherlands and abroad. We are currently researching the next steps for the treatment of the painting\", the museum spokesperson told the BBC.",
      "\"We expect that the work will be able to be shown again in the future,\" they added.",
      "Sophie McAloone, the conservation manager at the Fine Art Restoration Company, said that \"modern unvarnished\" paintings like Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 are \"particularly susceptible to damage\".",
      "This is \"owing to a combination of their complex modern materials, lack of a traditional coating layer, and intensity of flat colour fields, which make even the smallest areas of damage instantly perceptible,\" she said.",
      "\"In this case, scratching of the upper paint layers can have a significant impact on the viewing experience of the piece,\" Ms McAloone said.",
      "The Rothko painting was hanging in the museum's Depot \u2013 a publicly accessible storage facility beside the main museum \u2013 as part of an exhibition displaying a selection of \"public favourites\" from the gallery's collection.",
      "Jonny Helm, a marketing manager at the art restoration service Plowden & Smith, said the incident had implications for UK institutions such as V&A East and the British Museum, which are considering \"opening up the display of things that would otherwise be obscured in archives.\"",
      "\"How will this event affect other UK institutions who are opening up their archives in the same way?\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Restoring a Rothko painting is a difficult task because \"Rothko's mixture of pigments and resins and glues were quite complex\", Mr Helm said.",
      "He said the fact the painting is unvarnished \u2013 meaning it is \"open to the environment\" \u2013 will pose an additional challenge to conservators.",
      "Conservators working to restore the painting will now likely be in the process of documenting the extent of the damage and researching \"historic successful treatments\" of Rothko paintings.",
      "\"Rothko works seem to have terrible luck \u2013 this isn't the first damaged Rothko we've heard about,\" Mr Helm said.",
      "Rothko's 1958 work, Black on Maroon, was deliberately vandalised by Wlodzimierz Umaniec at London's Tate Modern gallery in October 2012.",
      "Umaniec was sent to prison for two years and subsequently apologised for his actions.",
      "During his trial, prosecuting barrister Gregor McKinley said the cost of repairing the work would be about \u00a3200,000. It took conservators 18 months to repair the painting.",
      "Rachel Myrtle, Head of Specie and Fine Arts at Aon, a company that offers insurance broking to its clients, said fine art insurance policies typically cover \"all risks associated with physical loss and damage to artwork\".",
      "This includes \"accidental damage caused by children or visitors, albeit with certain exclusions\", she said.",
      "She said that when an artwork is damaged, a gallery's insurer will appoint a specialist fine art loss adjuster to visit the museum.",
      "The loss adjustor typically \"reviews the damage to the artwork, examines any CCTV footage to determine the exact cause of the loss, and assesses conservation options\", Ms Myrtle said.",
      "The museum did not comment on who will be held liable for the damage to the 1960 painting, which the gallery reportedly bought in the 1970s.",
      "The Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen has previously billed visitors who have caused damage to artworks on display.",
      "In 2011, the museum asked an unsuspecting tourist who stepped on Wim T. Schippers' peanut butter floor artwork, called Pindakaasvloer, to pay for repairs to the work.",
      "Sharon Cohen, a spokesperson for the museum at the time, was quoted by AD as saying: \"It is normal procedure for people to pay if they damage art.\"",
      "The Rothko painting is described by the museum as an example of colour field painting, a term used to describe art characterised by large blocks of flat, solid colour spread across a canvas.",
      "Rothko's Grey, Orange on Maroon, No. 8 painting is one of several works of modern art that have been damaged in the Netherlands in recent years.",
      "In November 2024, multiple screen prints by the US pop artist Andy Warhol were damaged by thieves during an attempted robbery of the MPV art gallery in the town of Oisterwijk.",
      "In another incident, a Dutch town hall admitted it \"most likely\" disposed of 46 artworks by accident \u2013 including an Andy Warhol print of the former Dutch queen \u2013 during renovation works last year.",
      "Museums have different policies when responding to damage caused by children.",
      "In August last year, a four-year-old boy accidentally smashed a 3,500-year-old jar into pieces at the Hecht Museum in Israel.",
      "At the time, Hecht Museum worker Lihi Laszlo told the BBC the museum would not treat the incident \"with severity\" because \"the jar was accidentally damaged by a young child\".",
      "The family were invited back to the exhibition with his family for an organised tour shortly after the incident occurred.",

    "story": [
      "On a searing afternoon in Vietnam, Tung Linh declared she \"basically knows nothing\" about the bloody, decades-long war that pitted her country's Communist-run North against the United States-backed South.",
      "\"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student.",
      "Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, the capital, Ho Chi Minh, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed.",
      "Today's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat \u2013 it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer.",
      "Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China.",
      "But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war \u2013 it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential.",
      "Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia.",
      "But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle \u2013which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs",
      "Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50).",
      "\"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded.",
      "It's a dream that suits the bustling she city she lives in \u2013 now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, the Vietnamese capital has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city.",
      "You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon.",
      "And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace.",
      "America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over.",
      "The victory had come at enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two.",
      "But few here want talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\".",
      "Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back \u2013 they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade.",
      "\"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said.",
      "Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future \u2013 and her country's - is not uncommon.",
      "A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\"",
      "When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering.",
      "\"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\"",
      "Vietnam's new leaders appears to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team.",
      "The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates.",
      "The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment \u2013 and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores.",
      "After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan.",
      "\"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back.",
      "\"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\"",
      "It's no coincidence this shift began around 2017, when Trump declared his first trade war against China.",
      "Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\"",
      "They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world \u2013 but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods.",
      "Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\"",
      "Vietnam is again being asked to choose \u2013 America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big communist neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing \u2013 the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses.",
      "As Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs.",
      "But even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged.",
      "\"There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.\"",
      "But he says he bears no anger anymore.",
      "\"We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.\"",
      "There are signs Trump could be ready to retreat on tariffs",
      "Five cards China holds in a trade war with the US",
      "Trump's tariffs leave China's neighbours with an impossible choice",

      "After entering this small Indigenous community near Cairns in far north Queensland, with fishing nets sitting on palm-lined shores, the only thing fighting for attention is a truck selling ice cream \u2013 urgently dinging a bell as it avoids the wild horses and dogs that wander the streets.",
      "\"It's weird,\" says Suzanne Andrews, chief executive of the town's Gurriny Yealamucka Health Services. \"We don't see any placards. No-one's visiting us.\"",
      "Watching the leaders of Australia's two major parties debate each other on television, the Jaru Bunuba Bardi woman was dismayed that \"they didn't talk about any Aboriginal issues or concerns\".",
      "\"So,\" she asks \"what the hell's going on?\"",
      "Indigenous Australians, who represent about 3.8% of the nation's 26 million population, are by most socio-economic measures the most disadvantaged people in the country - something successive leaders have for years called a \"national shame\".",
      "Yet in this election campaign, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton have had little to say on First Nations issues.",
      "One glaring exception occurred this week, when during the final leader's debate Dutton said Indigenous \"welcome to country\" ceremonies -  where a local Aboriginal person acknowledges and give consent to events taking place on their traditional lands - were \"overdone\" and should not take place so frequently.",
      "The comments represent one of the only times on the campaign trail that Dutton has publicly addressed issues specifically relating to First Nations people \u2013 and not to discuss disadvantage, but within the context of a culture war.",
      "Part of the reason politicians try to steer clear of First Nations issues, according to experts and advocates, is that many believe they are too divisive and therefore electorally risky \u2013 especially after the failure of the Voice to Parliament referendum in 2023.",
      "That referendum, which was loudly supported by Albanese in the most polarising moment of his leadership, saw 60% of voters reject a proposal to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia's constitution and give them greater political say through a Voice to Parliament.",
      "Those opposing it said the idea was divisive, would create special \"classes\" of citizens where some have more rights than others, and the new advisory body would slow government decision-making.",
      "Ahead of the vote, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on both sides of the debate told the BBC they hoped the unprecedented level of interest in their lives would build momentum for more policies to improve them.",
      "Ms Andrews was one of them. But now she looks back at the result with sadness, believing it has now led political parties to \"play it safe\" and avoid \"the hot Aboriginal issues\".",
      "Others, including those who loudly opposed the Voice proposal, agree.",
      "On referendum night, prominent anti-Voice campaigner Warren Mundine told the BBC \"now the hard work starts\".",
      "Some 18 months on, he says the reality is that people on both sides of the political aisle promptly disengaged with Indigenous issues after the referendum.",
      "\"This is one of the sad things about this election campaign here: whether the Voice got up or didn't get up, we still had work to do,\" he said.",
      "\"What's happened now is that this is probably the first election that I've been in where there is no conversation about an Aboriginal policy. It's just gone silent.\"",
      "Lidia Thorpe, an independent senator in Victoria, told the BBC that \"Albanese particularly is too scared to mention us [Indigenous Australians] because of his failed referendum that we should never have had in the first place\".",
      "Thorpe spearheaded an Indigenous-run Blak Sovereign movement opposing the Voice, calling instead for priority to be given to a legally binding treaty between First Nations peoples and the Australian government.",
      "\"In previous elections, even though we may have been an afterthought and tacked on the end of the sentences, like we always are, at least we were mentioned. Now it's complete silence,\" she said.",
      "\"This election could have been a real opportunity for both leaders to unite the nation and tell some truth about the plight of our people. They need to tell the truth that these injustices continue, and they need to tell the truth that they are in a position to change that, to turn that around.\"",
      "Since 2008, the Australian government's Closing the Gap strategy has sought to reduce levels of Indigenous disadvantage through the annual tracking of 18 key measures in areas such as health and education.",
      "The latest review, however, found only four were on track to be met, while four were worsening \u2013 including the annual rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander incarceration, which was up 12% in a year.",
      "Despite these trends, Professor Rodney Smith of the University of Sydney says the defeat of the Voice - including in many Labor strongholds - makes it \"electorally foolish\" to talk too much about First Nations issues this election.",
      "He points to Coalition adverts that tie money \"wasted\" on the referendum \u2013 which is estimated to have cost more than $A400m \u2013 into the discussion about cost of living and a struggling economy.",
      "Prof Smith also argues, however, that the 2025 election is not unprecedented in its lack of focus on Indigenous affairs, but rather a return to the norm after several years of the issues receiving more attention than usual.",
      "\"I'm not saying people shouldn't care about this,\" he says. \"I'm just saying that generally speaking, the electorate doesn't particularly care about it.\"",
      "Recent data from Australian National University (ANU) seems to back that up. A long-term study of voter attitudes found that between January 2024 and January 2025 there was a sharp decline in the number of people believing it was the government's responsibility to reduce the gap in living standards between First Nations Australians and the rest of the population.",
      "\"This lack of policy focus (by Labor and the Coalition) reflects a low prioritisation amongst the Australian population\" ANU's Professor Nicholas Biddle said.",

      "A former minister of Aboriginal Affairs when a Queensland state MP in the 1980s, Mr Katter says he thinks about the struggles of many Indigenous Australians \"every night before I go to bed\".",

      "He also admits he doesn't talk about those issues on the campaign trail, though.",
      "\"As a politician that's got to win votes in the election, I wouldn't be game,\" he told the BBC.",
      "That's hard for many Indigenous people to swallow given the toll the referendum took - on those on both sides of the debate.",
      "A report published by Sydney's University of Technology last month found that the Voice referendum led to an increase in hostile levels of racism towards First Nations People, recording 453 \"validated\" incidents of racism roughly six months either side of the vote.",
      "About a fifth of all complaints contained mention of the failed referendum.",
      "\"While there was significant thought and debate given to the ideas of nation building and the righting of wrongs, the undercurrent of racism was ever present,\" said the report's guest author Professor Lindon Coombes in his introduction.",
      "\"This is its insidiousness.\"",
      "In Yarrabah, Ms Andrews becomes suddenly tearful, telling how her two daughters, studying at university in Brisbane, were intimidated and got \"so many racist remarks\" after the vote.",

      "S\u00e1nchez on Monday evening said 15GW of power - the equivalent to 60% of demand at that time - was \"suddenly lost from the system... in just five seconds\".",
      "Mr Prieto said during a news conference on Tuesday that there were two \"disconnection events\" barely a second apart in the south-west of Spain, where there is substantial solar power generation.",
      "One issue that the Spanish grid operator may have been referring to was when power companies identify a mismatch of supply and demand for electricity that could lead to instability, and disconnect temporarily in order to protect their systems.",
      "However, S\u00e1nchez later said the power cut was \"not a problem of excessive renewables\". He said there was not a failure of coverage - meaning supply - and there was a relatively low demand for electricity that was quite normal in the days running up to the crisis.",
      "So what exactly happened? It is unclear, especially as many systems fail in electricity supply quite frequently, not only renewables, and outages on this scale happen somewhere in the world around once a year on average.",
      "The mismatch between supply and demand of electricity can change the frequency of the electricity grid, which is 50Hz in Europe and the UK.",
      "If that frequency changes out of a narrow range, it could lead to damage to equipment.",
      "\"When a big company detects that the frequency is moving out of their tolerance, they can go offline to protect their equipment,\" said Prof Hannah Christensen at the University of Oxford.",
      "If lots of companies do that in quick succession, it can have \"cascading effects\" and lead to a black-out, she added.",
      "But when it comes to renewables, operators have very accurate short-term weather forecasts to predict when there will be a surplus of wind of solar power, so they adjust power supply accordingly, Prof Christensen said.",
      "Renewable power has different challenges to fossil fuel energy \"because of its intermittency\", she said, but it is a well-known issue that is planned for.",
      "\"It is a little perplexing that this wouldn't have been predicted,\" she said.",
      "Prof Keith Bell, at the University of Strathclyde, added that \"if a system is relying on solar and wind, they design a system to reflect that,\" suggesting that the additional supply of energy from renewables will not have been a surprise to the grid.",
      "\"Spain has a lot of experience of wind and solar, and a long-standing system of forecasting weather and its impacts,\" he said.",
      "\"All sorts of systems fail,\" he added. \"Things can and do go wrong, whether that is from renewables, fossil fuels or nuclear power. This could be the Swiss cheese model, where the holes in the system have happened to align.\"",
      "Was it related to Spain's connection to France?",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica also suggested that the drop of power caused a grid interconnection between Spain and France to trip.",
      "Two basic technologies are used to interconnect parts of a grid or countries - a standard transmission line that carries alternating currents, and increasingly, high voltage direct current lines.",
      "Spain has a high voltage line that came into service seven years ago, meaning it is well-tested, Prof Bell said.",
      "The Iberian peninsula is often referred to as an \"electricity island\" because it relies on just a few connections through the Pyrenees to France, meaning it can be vulnerable to failures.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said power was brought back online thanks to connections with France and Morocco as well as gas and hydropower sources.",
      "Was it linked to a 'rare atmospheric event'?",
      "Portugal's grid operator REN refuted initial reports, attributed to the agency on Monday, which said the blackout was caused by a rare atmospheric event.",
      "The message in Portuguese said that \"due to extreme temperature variations in the interior or Spain, there were anomalous oscillations in the very high voltage lines (400 KV), a phenomenon known as 'induced atmospheric vibration'\".",
      "\"These oscillations caused synchronisation failures between the electrical systems, leading to successive disturbances across the interconnected European network.\"",
      "However, REN spokesman Bruno Silva told AFP on Tuesday that the grid operator \"did not put out this statement,\" without giving further details.",

    "summary": "Mark Carney's party pull off an election win that once looked near-impossible, until the US president targeted Canada.",
    "story": [
      "Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a remarkable victory in the Canadian election \u2013 and it appears to have come with a big assist from Donald Trump.",
      "The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party.",
      "Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: \"President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Until Trump's return to power, Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party had held what looked like high and insurmountable ground in voter preference polls amidst general dissatisfaction with the state of the Canadian economy and almost a decade of Liberal government under then leader Justin Trudeau.",
      "The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control \u2013 with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples.",
      "This Canadian general election broke that trend, as the Liberals forced Trudeau to resign and picked a political outsider, former Bank of England chief Carney, as their leader.",
      "He ran hard against what the party continuously characterised as the real threat Trump posed not just to their economy but also to Canada's very sovereignty.",

      "No one should expect those Liberals to say thank you to the American leader, however \u2013 or for Trump to soften his rhetoric, even though last month he said he preferred a Liberal prime minister. (He would go on to say that he really didn't care who won.)",
      "Instead, more of the same is the likely result \u2013 more pointed quips about Canada joining the US, more threats of a trade war and more willingness to cast longstanding ties and agreements with America's northern neighbour into doubt.",
      "The irony, however, is that Trump's derisive focus on Canada may have denied him a northern neighbour run by, if not a kindred spirit, at least a politician more in line with his populist conservative priorities than Liberal Carney.",
      "While Poilievre, a veteran politician, will never be mistaken for the American businessman-turned-president, they have some similarities \u2013 a goal of shrinking government, lowering taxes and trimming social services, a desire to promote fossil fuel production, and a distaste for what they both deride as \"woke\" leftist culture.",
      "A Conservative victory in this election would have been viewed by many \u2013 in America and throughout the world \u2013 as a new sign that the Trump win last year was more than just a singular American event. It would have represented what many in Trump's orbit like to believe is a global movement toward their brand of culturally conservative, anti-elite, anti-immigration, and pro-working-class politics.",
      "Although Trump doesn't appear to have the same distaste for Carney that he clearly held for Trudeau, his political and policy interests and those of Canada now appear destined to continue to diverge.",
      "Already there are indications that Canada is looking more toward Europe as a reliable partner, rather than Trump's America \u2013 a move that is sure to irk the American leader.",
      "Carney has pledged to quickly begin new trade negotiations with Trump in an attempt to stave off US tariffs on Canadian auto exports set to kick in on 3 May.",
      "The Canadian economy, which heavily depends on exports to the US, is at considerable risk if a full trade war erupts, and Carney \u2013 an economist by training and a veteran central banker - has promised voters that he will do everything in his power to keep Canada from tumbling into a recession.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump belly-flopped into Canadian politics one more time on Monday, while voters were casting their ballots, again calling the US-Canadian border \"artificially drawn\" and saying the nation would be better off as a \"cherished\" American state.",
      "Carney ascended to political power quite suddenly, at a time when his country is facing a generational challenge from its superpower neighbour. Many world leaders are still working out how to deal with Donald Trump in his second term, but few will face this kind of test."

      "However diversified and advanced Spain's energy mix is, the national power collapse at 12:35 on Monday required an enormous effort to get Spain back up and running.",

      "Combined-cycle gas plants also played a significant part in repowering the grid, but four nuclear power reactors at Almaraz, Asc\u00f3 and and Vandell\u00f3s were automatically shut down by the outage, and three others were already offline anyway.",
      "Spain's neighbours France and Morocco also came to its aid.",
      "Morocco said 900MW of power had been transferred through two high-voltage lines that cross the Strait of Gibraltrar from Fardioua to Tarifa in southern Spain.",
      "French operator RTE said it had been \"gradually transferring more electricity to the Spanish border\" via its power lines supplying Catalonia in north-east Spain and the Basque country in the north-west.",
      "RTE said the Iberian network had been disconnected from 12:38 to 13:30 on Monday, when the 400kV line to Catalonia was restored. Within minutes, France had supplied 700MW and RTE said it was later able to increase that by up to 2,000 MW.",
      "Power was then eventually restored to Spain's electricity substations in the north, south and west of the peninsula.",
      "By 19:20 on Monday, the grid operator said more than a fifth of demand had been restored by way of Spain's own electricity generation and from France.",
      "Electricity provider Endesa said it had restored almost 3.5 million customers by 19:15 and had prioritised hospitals and other strategic infrastructure.",
      "Just over an hour later the head of Red El\u00e9ctrica boss Eduardo Prieto said about 9,200 MW of demand - about 35.1% - had been restored.",

    "summary": "Historians say there were three popes of North African descent, the last one more than 1,500 years ago.",
    "story": [
      "Now predominantly Muslim, North Africa was once a Christian heartland, producing Catholic popes who left their mark on the Church to this day.",
      "Their papacies were in the era of the Roman Empire, which stretched across modern-day Tunisia, the north-east of Algeria and the coast of western Libya.",
      "\"North Africa was the Bible Belt of ancient Christianity,\" says Prof Christopher Bellitto, a historian at Kean University in the US.",
      "Many Catholics in Africa are hoping that the papacy will return to the continent  for the first time in more than 1,500 years, as a successor to Pope Francis is chosen.",
      "Here, we look at the three previous African popes - and how they got Christians to celebrate Easter Sunday and St Valentine's Day.",
      "All three have been recognised in the Church as saints.",
      "Victor I (189-199)",
      "Thought to be of Berber origin, Pope Victor I was in charge of the Catholic Church at a time when Christians were sometimes being persecuted by Roman officials for refusing to worship Roman gods.",
      "He is perhaps best known for ensuring Christians celebrate Easter on a Sunday.",
      "In the 2nd Century, some Christian groups from the Roman province of Asia (in modern-day Turkey) celebrated Easter on the same day that Jews celebrated Passover, which could fall on different days of the week.",
      "However, Christians in the Western part of the Empire believed that Jesus was resurrected on a Sunday, so Easter should always be celebrated on that day.",
      "The debate over when the resurrection took place made it an extremely contentious issue.",
      "The \"Easter controversy\" was symbolic of larger conflicts between East and West, and whether or not Christians should follow Jewish practices.",
      "Victor I called the very first Roman Synod - a gathering of Church leaders - to resolve the impasse.",
      "He did this by threatening to excommunicate from the Church those bishops who refused to comply with his wishes.",
      "\"He was a rather forceful voice for getting everyone on literally the same page,\" Prof Bellitto told the BBC.",
      "This was an impressive feat, the historian said, because \"he was the Bishop of Rome when Christianity was illegal in the Roman empire.\"",
      "Another important part of Victor I's legacy was to introduce Latin as the common language of the Catholic Church. Previously Ancient Greek was the primary language of the Catholic Liturgy as well as official communication for the Church.",
      "Victor I himself wrote in - and spoke - Latin, which was widely spoken in North Africa.",
      "Miltiades (AD311-314)",
      "Pope Miltiades is believed to have been born in Africa.",
      "During his reign, Christianity gained increasing acceptance from successive Roman emperors, eventually becoming the Empire's official religion.",
      "Before this, the persecution of Christians had been widespread at different points in the Empire's history.",
      "However, Prof Bellitto pointed out that Miltiades was not responsible for this change, saying the Pope was the \"recipient of the Roman benevolence\" rather than being a great negotiator.",
      "Miltiades was given a palace by the Roman Emperor Constantine, becoming the first pope to have an official residence.",
      "He was also granted permission by Constantine to build the Lateran Basilica, now the oldest public church in Rome.",
      "While modern popes live and work in the Vatican, the Lateran church is sometimes referred to in Catholicism as \"the mother of all churches\".",
      "Gelasius I (AD492-496)",
      "Gelasius I is the only one of the three African popes who historians believe was not born in Africa.",
      "\"There's a reference to him being... Roman-born. So we don't know if he [ever] lived in North Africa, but it seems clear that he was of North African descent,\" Prof Bellitto explained.",
      "He was the most important of the three African church leaders, according to Prof Bellitto.",
      "Gelasius I is widely recognised as the first pope to officially be called the \"Vicar of Christ\", a term that signifies the Pope's role as Christ's representative on Earth.",
      "He also developed the Doctrine of the Two Swords, which emphasised the separate-but-equal powers of the Church and the state.",
      "Gelasius I made the critical distinction that both powers were given to the Church by God, who then delegated earthly power to the state, making the Church ultimately superior.",
      "\"Later on, in the Middle Ages, popes sometimes tried to veto the selection of an emperor or a king, because they said God gave them that power,\" said Prof Bellitto.",
      "Gelasius I is remembered, too, for his response to the Acacian Schism - a split between the Eastern and Western Christian Churches from 484 to 519.",
      "During this period, Gelasius I asserted the supremacy of Rome and the papacy over the entire Church, East and West, which experts believe went further than any of his predecessors.",
      "Gelasius is also responsible for a popular celebration which is still marked every year - establishing St Valentine's Day on 14 February in 496 to commemorate the Christian martyr St Valentine.",
      "Some accounts say Valentine was a priest who continued to perform weddings in secret when they were banned by Emperor Claudius II.",
      "Historians believe that Valentine's Day is rooted in the Roman love and fertility festival, Lupercalia, and was a move by Gelasius I to Christianise pagan traditions.",
      "What did Africa's popes look like?",
      "Prof Bellitto says there is no way of knowing with any degree of accuracy what the three popes looked like.",
      "\"We have to remember that the Roman Empire, and indeed the Middle Ages, didn't think of race as we think of it nowadays. It had nothing to do with skin colour,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"People in the Roman Empire didn't deal with race, they dealt with ethnicity.\"",
      "Prof Philomena Mwaura, an academic at Kenya's Kenyatta University, told the BBC that Roman Africa was very multicultural, with local Berber and Punic groups, freed slaves and people who had come from Rome found there.",
      "\"The North African community was quite mixed, and it was a trade route also for many people who were involved in trade in the earlier antiquity,\" she explained.",
      "Rather than identifying with specific ethnic groups, \"most people who belonged to areas within the Roman Empire regarded themselves as Roman\", Prof Mwaura added.",

      "Who will be the next Pope?",
      "How a Pope is elected",
      "Why the conclave is so unpredictable",
      "Why hasn't there been an African pope since?",
      "None of of the 217 popes since Gelasius I are believed to have come from Africa.",
      "\"The church in North Africa was weakened by very many forces, including the fall of the Roman Empire and also the incursion of Muslims [into North Africa] in the 7th Century,\" Prof Mwaura said.",
      "However, some experts argue that the prevalence of Islam in North Africa does not explain the absence of a pope from the entire continent over more than 1,500 years.",
      "Prof Bellitto said the process of electing a new pontiff became an \"Italian monopoly\" for many years.",
      "However, he said there was a strong chance of a pope from Asia or Africa in the near future because Catholics in the southern hemisphere outnumber those in the north.",
      "In fact, Catholicism is expanding more rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa today than anywhere else.",
      "The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023. This accounts for 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "Three Africans are in the race to succeed Pope Francis - the Democratic Republic of Congo's Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, Ghana's Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson and Guinea's Robert Sarah.",
      "But Prof Mwaura argued that \"although Christianity is very strong in Africa, the power of the Church is still in the north, where the resources have been\".",
      "\"Maybe, as it continues to be very strong within the continent and supporting itself, then a time will come when there could be an African pope,\" she said.",

      "The head of Israel's Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency has resigned.",
      "Ronen Bar made the announcement that he would leave his position on 15 June at a memorial event for Shin Bet members who have died in service.",
      "It came after he had been engaged in a fierce trading of recriminations with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who dismissed him last month. A challenge to the Supreme Court by the attorney general and the opposition had put the move on hold.",
      "Ronen Bar said he had chosen to announce his resignation on an evening that, in his words, symbolised \"remembrance, heroism and sacrifice\".",
      "He said every public servant who failed to stop the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the Gaza war, needed to bow their heads \"humbly before those who were killed, or wounded, or taken hostage, and act accordingly\".",
      "On Sunday, Netanyahu presented an affidavit to the Supreme Court in which he accused Bar of being a liar.",
      "In his own affidavit, the Shin Bet chief had accused the prime minister of demanding excessive personal loyalty and ordering his agency to spy on anti-government protesters.",
      "The confrontation has further exposed the deepening rifts in Israeli politics and society between the right-wing and hardliners supporting Netanyahu and the more liberal elements in the country, who took to the streets to protest against the government's moves to curb the powers of the judiciary for many months before the 7 October attacks.",
      "It centres on Netanyahu's insistence that he fired the Shin Bet head for professional failures.",
      "Bar countered by saying that his dismissal was motivated by political and personal considerations.",
      "In his affidavit last week, the spy chief said that it was \"clear\" that if there were to be a constitutional crisis, Netanyahu would expect him to obey the prime minister and not the courts.",
      "He also said Netanyahu had put pressure on him to use the Shin Bet to spy on Israelis leading or providing financial support to anti-government protests.",
      "Many in Israel reacted with alarm, saying it was evidence of what appeared to be an unprecedented effort to overstep the powers of the domestic intelligence agency.",
      "In his affidavit, which functioned as a form of rebuttal, Netanyahu excoriated the Shin Bet head.",
      "\"The accusation according to which I allegedly demanded action against innocent civilians, or against a non-violent and legitimate protest during the protests of 2023, is an absolute lie,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu also trained his sights on the security failures in the lead-up to and during the 7 October attacks, saying that Bar bore \"massive and direct responsibility\" for them and had \"failed in his role as chief of Shin Bet and lost the confidence of the entire Israeli government as far as his ability to continue to manage the organisation\".",
      "Bar immediately responded in kind in a statement, saying Netanyahu's affidavit was \"full of inaccuracies, biased quotes and half-truths aimed at taking things out of context and changing reality\".",
      "The Supreme Court was facing a quandary over who to believe - which Bar's resignation may have to some extent pre-empted.",
      "However, Bar made clear on Monday that he would play a part, if necessary, in any future proceedings.",
      "\"The court hearing is not about my personal affairs, but about the independence of the next heads of the Shin Bet, and of course I am ready to appear for any procedure that the court may require in this regard in the future,\" he said.",
      "The issues which have been exposed in the fierce recriminations between the two men have once again focused attention on the increasing bitterness between opposed sections of Israeli society.",
      "These have been further exacerbated by the ever-growing fault line between those who support Netanyahu and his hard-line government in wanting to continue the war in Gaza to eliminate Hamas at all costs, and those who believe the fate of the living Israeli hostages still being held by Hamas must be put first, even if it means ending the war.",

    "summary": "Vladimir Putin calls a three-day ceasefire in May, coinciding with events marking the 80th anniversary of World War Two's end.",
    "story": [
      "When is a ceasefire a genuine attempt to secure peace? And when is it simply PR?",
      "It's a question that's been asked a lot lately.",
      "Mostly in relation to Russia's president.",
      "Short ceasefires are becoming quite the Kremlin thing.",
      "First, Vladimir Putin declared a 30-hour cessation of hostilities over Easter, portraying it as a \"humanitarian\" gesture.",
      "Now the Kremlin leader has announced a three-day unilateral truce for early May. It will run from 8 May to 10 May to coincide with events marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two.",
      "In a statement, the Kremlin said that for 72 hours all military actions would cease. It cited \"humanitarian\" considerations (again) and made it clear Moscow expected Ukraine to follow suit.",
      "In response to the proposal, Ukraine questioned why Russia could not commit to a ceasefire immediately and called for one to be implemented for at least 30 days.",
      "\"If Russia truly wants peace, it must cease fire immediately,\" Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said, adding: \"Why wait until May 8th?\"",
      "So, from the Russian president who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago, is this a sincere effort to end the fighting?",
      "Or simply a public relations exercise by the Kremlin to impress Donald Trump?",
      "Kremlin critics will suspect PR.",
      "During the extremely brief so-called Easter ceasefire, Ukraine had accused Russian troops of violating it repeatedly.",
      "Moscow had used its announcement of a 30-hour pause in the fighting to send a signal to the White House: that in this war Russia is the peacemaker and Kyiv the aggressor. It accused Ukraine of ignoring what Moscow presented as an olive branch and of prolonging the war.",
      "Trump questions Putin's desire for peaceCritical week for US's future in war talks",
      "Trump questions Putin's desire for peace",
      "Critical week for US's future in war talks",
      "Recent comments by Trump suggest the US president hasn't bought that.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social platform at the weekend, Trump wrote that \"there was no reason\" for Putin \"to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns [in Ukraine], over the last few days\".",
      "\"It makes me think,\" he added, \"that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?' Too many people are dying!!!\"",
      "Cue today's announcement of another Russian ceasefire. This one slightly longer: three days. And, again, that claim of \"humanitarian\" concerns.",
      "Another attempt to signal to Washington that the Kremlin has only the best of intentions? That Russia is really the good guy in all of this?",
      "If so, it doesn't appear to have worked. Not immediately. The White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt noted Moscow's offer of a temporary ceasefire, but said: \"The president [Donald Trump] has made it clear he wants to see a permanent ceasefire first to stop the killing, stop the bloodshed.",
      "\"He is increasingly frustrated with leaders of both countries,\" Leavitt said.",
      "It's an indication that the US president may be losing patience now with the Kremlin, despite having directed most of his public criticism in recent months towards President Zelensky.",
      "Last month the Trump administration was pushing both Russia and Ukraine to agree to a 30-day comprehensive unconditional ceasefire. Ukraine had signed up to that. Russia did not.",
      "Already senior Russian officials are using President Putin's three-day ceasefire offer to try to cast Ukraine in a bad light.",
      "\"It is doubtful that [President] Zelensky will support the decision of our president and accept the ceasefire,\" the speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, told Russian state TV.",
      "Hardly an encouraging sign, so soon after the announcement of another brief ceasefire."

    "summary": "The BBC exposes the members of the security forces who fired on protesters at Kenya\u2019s parliament last year.",
    "story": [
      "The members of Kenya's security forces who shot dead anti-tax protesters at the country's parliament last June have been identified by the BBC.",
      "The BBC's analysis of more than 5,000 images also shows that those killed there were unarmed and not posing a threat.",
      "The East African nation's constitution guarantees the right to peaceful protest, and the deaths caused a public outcry.",
      "Despite a parliamentary committee ordering Kenya's Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) to investigate the deaths on the streets of the capital, Nairobi - and make public its findings - no report regarding the killings at parliament has yet been issued and no-one has been held to account.",
      "The BBC World Service team analysed videos and photos taken by protesters and journalists on the day. We determined when each was taken using camera metadata, livestream timings and public clocks visible in the shots.",
      "We plotted three of the killings on a 3D reconstruction of Kenya's parliament, allowing us to trace the fatal shots back to the rifles of a police officer and a soldier.",
      "What follows is BBC Africa Eye's detailed timeline of events as Kenya's MPs entered parliament for the final vote on the government's controversial finance bill, while protesters amassed on the streets outside on Tuesday 25 June 2024.",
      "Warning: This story contains images of dead bodies",
      "Young people, labelled Gen Z protesters who had mobilised themselves on social media, began streaming into central Nairobi early in the morning - in what would be the capital's third large-scale protest since the finance bill was introduced on 9 May.",
      "\"It was a beautiful party,\" says prominent human rights activist Boniface Mwangi, who was there.",
      "\"Kids came out with Bluetooth speakers and their water. It was a carnival.\"",
      "Protests earlier in the week had already led lawmakers to axe tax increases on bread, cooking oil, mobile money and motor vehicles, as well as an eco levy that would have raised the cost of goods like nappies and sanitary towels.",
      "But other measures to raise the $2.7bn (\u00a32bn) the government said it needed to cut its reliance on external borrowing, such as higher import taxes and another on specialised hospitals, remained.",
      "\"For the first time it was the Kenyan people - the working class and the middle class and the lower class - against the ruling class,\" says Mwangi.",
      "The protesters had one target - parliament, where the final vote was taking place.",
      "By 09:30 local time, the last of the MPs filed into the lower house.",
      "Outside, thousands pushed towards Parliament Road from the east, north and west of the city.",
      "\"For me, it was just a normal day,\" says 26-year-old student journalist Ademba Allans.",
      "People were livestreaming on their TikTok and Instagram accounts, while events were broadcast live on national TV, he adds.",
      "At first, protesters were held back at roadblocks by tear gas and truncheons, then police started using water cannons and rubber bullets.",
      "By 13:00, more than 100,000 people were on the streets.",
      "\"The numbers start getting bigger and people actually start getting arrested,\" says Allans. \"The police are everywhere. They're trying to push people back. People are even climbing on top of those water cannons.\"",
      "Despite the growing chaos outside, MPs remained in the chamber and the voting began.",
      "By 14:00, protesters had pushed police all the way back to the north-eastern corner of parliament.",
      "Inside at 14:14, the Finance Bill 2024 was voted in: 195 in favour, 106 against. Opposition MPs stormed out and word instantly reached the masses outside.",
      "\"This is when everybody is saying: 'Whatever happens, we are going to enter the parliament and show the MPs that we believe in what we're fighting for,'\" says Allans.",
      "At 14:20, protesters finally broke through the police blockade and reached the road running alongside parliament.",
      "An abandoned police truck stationed outside the gates was set on fire. Fences were torn down and protesters set foot on parliamentary grounds. The incursion was short-lived. Parliamentary security forces quickly cleared them out.",
      "At the same time, police officers went back up Parliament Road in force to drive the protesters back.",
      "While this was happening, journalists were filming, producing minute-by-minute footage from many angles.",
      "One of those videos captured a plain-clothes police officer shouting \"uaa!\", the Swahili word for \"kill\". Seconds later, a police officer knelt, gunshots were heard and protesters in the crowd collapsed - seven in total.",
      "David Chege, a 39-year-old software engineer and Sunday-school teacher, and Ericsson Mutisya, a 25-year-old butcher, were shot dead. Five other men were wounded, one of whom was left paralysed from the waist down.",
      "Footage shows Allans, the student journalist, holding up a Kenyan flag as he tried to reach Chege and another casualty bleeding out after the gunfire.",
      "But who fired those shots?",
      "In the video of the officer shouting, \"uaa!\", the shooter's back was to the camera. But the BBC compared his body armour, riot shield and headgear with that of every police officer at the scene.",
      "In his case, he had an upturned neck guard. We matched his distinctive uniform to an officer in a video recorded seconds later. There, he made sure to hide his face before firing into the crowd. We do not know his name.",
      "Even after the fatal shots, the plain-clothes officer could still be heard urging his colleagues forward to \"kill\". He was not so cautious about concealing his identity: his name is John Kaboi.",
      "Multiple sources have told the BBC he is based at the Central Nairobi Police Station.",
      "The BBC put its allegations to Kenya's police service, which said the force could not investigate itself, adding that the IPOA was responsible for investigating alleged misconduct.",
      "Kaboi has been approached for comment and not replied.",
      "No-one has been held accountable for the deaths of Chege or Mutisya. The BBC found that neither of them was armed.",
      "But these would not be the only lives lost. Rather than spook the demonstrators, the killings galvanised them and they tried for parliament again.",
      "At 14:57 they made it in.",
      "Footage shows them breaking down the fences and walking across the parliament's grounds. Many had their hands up. Others were holding placards or the Kenyan flag.",
      "Warning shots were fired. The demonstrators ducked down, then continued towards the building, filming on their phones as they went.",
      "Once inside, momentum turned to mayhem. Doors were kicked in, part of the complex was set alight and the last of the MPs fled the building.",
      "The destruction was severe but, after five minutes, footage showed them leaving the same way they had come in.",
      "At 15:04, shots rang out again and protesters tumbled across the flattened fence. As the smoke cleared, camera footage showed three bodies lying on the ground. Two were wounded - one raised his hand but could not get up.",
      "The third, 27-year-old finance student Eric Shieni, was dead - shot in the head from behind as he was leaving the grounds. The BBC again found, as in the cases of Chege and Mutisya, that he had been unarmed.",
      "BBC Africa Eye analysed more than 150 images taken during the minutes before and after Shieni was shot. We are able to identify the soldier who fired at the back of his head from 25m (82ft) away - again, we do not know his name.",
      "\"The video is very clear,\" says Faith Odhiambo, president of the Law Society of Kenya.",
      "\"The aim was to kill those protesters. They could have had him arrested. But the fact that you shoot his head - it was clearly an intention to kill.",
      "\"You have become the judge, the jury and the sentence executioner for Eric.\"",
      "The Kenyan Defence Forces (KDF) told the BBC the IPOA had not forwarded any request to look into any of its personnel involved in the operations at parliament.",
      "It added: \"The KDF remains fully committed to upholding the rule of law and continues to operate strictly within its constitutional mandate.\"",
      "After the shooting Allans is seen again, leading the evacuation. Footage shows him carrying a man with blood gushing from his leg.",
      "\"I feared for my life, that my parents would never see me again,\" he says.",
      "\"But I also feared to let other people die when I could help.\"",
      "People outside the UK can watch here",
      "As the sun set on 25 June, the country was reeling. After a week of protests, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights declared that 39 people had died and 361 had been injured around the country.",
      "That evening President William Ruto thanked his security officers for their \"defence of the nation's sovereignty\" against \"organised criminals\" who had \"hijacked\" the protests.",
      "The following day, the finance bill was dropped.",
      "\"Listening keenly to the people of Kenya, who have said loudly that they want nothing to do with this Finance Bill 2024, I concede,\" the president said in a national televised address, adding he would not sign it into law.",
      "But to this day no security officer has been held to account for the deaths and no official investigation has been published.",

    "summary": "The impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.",
    "story": [
      "During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House.",
      "But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed.",
      "In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors.",
      "In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life.",
      "To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms.",
      "But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process.",
      "Here are six turning points from the first 100 days.",
      "A social media post sets off a constitutional firestorm",
      "For once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry.",
      "Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X.",
      "In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy.",
      "Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution.",
      "Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders.",
      "But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts.",
      "The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies.",
      "This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.",
      "The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.",
      "Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court.",
      "A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote.",
      "Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply.",
      "It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith.",
      "While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.",
      "Brandishing a chainsaw, dressed in black",
      "Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd.",
      "The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.",
      "Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.",
      "\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"",
      "It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.",
      "Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash.",
      "Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public.",
      "Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events.",
      "Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly.",
      "Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending.",
      "If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.",
      "'I had to think fast as billions was lost before my eyes'",
      "When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast.",
      "\"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says.",
      "McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\".",
      "He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.",
      "\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\"",
      "He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.",
      "The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.",
      "The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory.",
      "His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans.",
      "But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent.",
      "The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession.",
      "While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field.",
      "\"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"",
      "Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.",
      "Spotted in a photo - 'My son, shackled in prison'",
      "\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world.",
      "She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows.",
      "At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter.",
      "When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent.",
      "A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge.",
      "Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years.",
      "A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz.",
      "Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas.",
      "Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted.",
      "While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches.",
      "They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.",
      "A clash with academic, media and corporate worlds",
      "On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on.",
      "In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants.",
      "It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations.",
      "The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address.",
      "But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024.",
      "The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.",
      "Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department.",
      "A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds.",
      "Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives.",
      "Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments.",
      "A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (\u00a311m) to Trump's presidential foundation.",
      "CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted.",
      "Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.",
      "A retreat on race and identity",
      "The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River.",
      "Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack.",
      "A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence.",
      "It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.",
      "Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",
      "His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes.",
      "First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups.",
      "Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers.",
      "But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America.",
      "While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows.",
      "Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\".",
      "Donald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president.",
      "His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire.",
      "In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president.",
      "And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question.",

    "summary": "Suspects who are accused of robbing Kim Kardashian at gunpoint in October 2016 stand trial in Paris.",
    "story": [
      "The morning after the heist, burglar Yunice Abbas went home to catch up on some sleep.",
      "When he woke up, his wife was glued to the TV. The headline news of the day was that American reality TV star Kim Kardashian, then 35, had been tied up and robbed at gunpoint in a luxury Paris apartment.",
      "All her jewellery - worth about $10m (\u00a37.5m), and including the engagement ring her then-husband and rapper Kanye West gifted her, which alone was worth $4m (\u00a33m) - had been taken.",
      "Yunice Abbas' wife glared at him. \"This has you written all over it,\" she grumbled.",
      "She was right. The 62-year-old had dabbled in crime his whole life, from petty offences to bank heists.",
      "The Kardashian robbery, he later wrote in a memoir, was going to be his last job before retirement.",
      "But a series of blunders meant the heist was doomed from the start and in early 2017 - three months after the robbery - Abbas and several of his alleged accomplices were arrested.",
      "Ten of them will now be appearing in court in Paris in a trial set to last just under three weeks.",
      "Out of those, five are accused of taking part in the heist, and six are accused of being accessories to the crime.",
      "Most of them were born in the 1950s, leading French media to dub them the \"grandpa robbers\".",
      "Abbas and a 68-year-old man, Aomar Ait Khedache, have confessed; the others have not.",
      "One has since passed away, and another, aged 81, will be excused as he is suffering from advanced dementia.",
      "By the time the trial starts, almost nine years will have gone by since the heist.",
      "Gun wielding robbers fled on bikes and on foot",
      "On the night between 2 and 3 October 2016, Abbas and four accomplices allegedly staked out Kardashian's discreet suite in Hotel de Pourtal\u00e8s, in the glitzy Madeleine neighbourhood in Paris, not far from the Op\u00e9ra and Place Vendome.",
      "At around 03:00 local time, they burst into the hotel's entrance hall, dressed as policemen and wielding a gun.",
      "They threatened and handcuffed Abderrahmane Ouatiki, an Algerian PhD student who regularly took up shifts as night receptionist, and marched him up to Kardashian's room.",
      "She was resting on her bed, tired from days of attending Paris Fashion Week events, when she heard stomping up the stairs.",
      "She called out for her sister Kourtney and her stylist Stephanie, but when they didn't answer she panicked.",
      "\"I knew someone was there to get me,\" she recalled in an interview with US interviewer David Letterman years later. \"You just feel it.\"",
      "Kim dialled 911 but the number, of course, didn't work outside of the US. As she was calling her then-security guard Pascal Duvier - who had accompanied her sister to a club - the men burst in, pushed her on the bed and started shouting.",
      "\"They kept on saying: the ring, the ring! And I was so startled that it didn't compute for a minute,\" she told Letterman.",
      "The language barrier meant Ouatiki had to act as an interpreter.",
      "They found the ring and stuffed it in a bag along with several other jewels, as well as \u20ac1000 in cash. One of the men grabbed her and pulled her towards him.",
      "Because she was wearing a robe with nothing underneath, she thought he was going to assault her, Kim later told Letterman, wiping tears away.",
      "But instead \u2013 using the technique of saucissonnage, or the practice of tying victims up like a saucisson, a salami - the man bound her with zip ties and duct tape, and left her in the bathroom.",
      "Then, he and the rest of the burglars fled on bikes and on foot. Kim freed herself of her restraints, and shortly after her security guard turned up.",
      "Traumatised, Kim gave a statement to French police in the early hours of the morning and flew back to the US by dawn.",
      "It wasn't until later that day, when Abbas caught a glimpse of the TV screen his wife was watching, that he understood who their victim was.",
      "\"There were breaking news alerts saying Kim Kardashian had been robbed at gunpoint \u2013 that's how important it was,\" says LA-based entertainment journalist KJ Matthews.",
      "Blunders meant heist was doomed from the start",
      "\"We were so fascinated with her and her family and their rise to fame... When the heist happened we were so surprised. How could burglars have gotten so close to her?\" Matthews says.",
      "But while mistakes were made in terms of Kardashian's security, serious errors were made on the burglars' side, too.",
      "\"They didn't take into account the progress made by police techniques, which can now find micro traces of DNA anywhere,\" said Patricia Tourancheau, a crime reporter and the author of \"Kim and the Grandpa Robbers\" - a thorough account of the heist and of the lives of its perpetrators.",
      "\"When they dressed up as police they thought 'that's it, nobody will be able to recognise us',\" she adds.",
      "But in 2016 Paris was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of the previous year, and there were a huge number of CCTV cameras all round the city, meaning police were able to spot the thieves and see them make off with the jewels.",
      "Other details of this story suggest that the thieves' planning was rather haphazard. When fleeing the scene on a bike, Abbas fell, dropping a bag of jewels.",
      "The next day, a passer-by found a diamond-encrusted necklace and wore it all day at the office before watching the news and realising where it had come from.",
      "Police arrested Abbas and several other people in January 2017 and later confirmed that they had been under surveillance for several weeks, after DNA traces left at the scene provided a match with Aomar Ait Khedache, also known as \"Omar the Old\".",
      "French media published a photo from the police stakeout, which shows several of the men having coffee and chatting at a Parisian caf\u00e9 that winter, just before their arrest.",
      "The question that remains - and which will undoubtedly be explored doing the trial - is just how the gang got wind of Kardashian's schedule.",
      "Court documents seen by the BBC show that both Khedache and Abbas stated that all the information they needed was posted online by Kardashian herself, whose very career was built on sharing details about her life and movements.",
      "But how did the gang know that on the night of 2 October Kardashian would be alone in her room, without her security guard?",
      "The documents indicate police believe Gary Madar, whose brother Michael's firm had provided transportation and taxis to the Kardashians for years, was an accessory to the heist and that he had fed information to the gang about Kim's whereabouts.",
      "Mr Madar was arrested in January 2017. His lawyer Arthur Vercken vehemently pushed back against the accusations, telling the BBC that \"since the start the case was built on assumptions, theses, theories - but no proof [of Madar's involvement] was ever found\".",
      "He added that although the Madar brothers exchanged texts about the Kardashians during Fashion Week it was just because they were \"bored\" and that when the heist took place Gary was asleep.",
      "Gary's brother, Michael, is not a defendant.",
      "\"Five men did this. You don't think one of them was keeping an eye on who was coming and going from her hotel?\" he said, suggesting that Mr Madar had only been arrested \"to prove that the French justice system works\".",
      "The trial will also attempt to determine where the jewels ended up.",
      "Police tracking of the gang's phones showed that soon after the heist Omar the Old travelled from Paris to Antwerp in Belgium, where 50% of the world's polished diamonds and 80% of rough diamonds are sold, according to the Diamond Investment Office.",
      "Many jewels were reportedly melted or broken up and sold. Abbas got \u20ac75,000 (\u00a364,000); others far less.",
      "As for Kim's engagement ring, Omar the Old said the gang was too scared to sell it on as it would be too easily traceable. It has never been found.",
      "Kim was undoubtedly spooked by the event, which marked the start of her social media hiatus.",
      "In an episode of the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, she tearfully recalled the night of the heist and said had been scared for her life; later she also said the robbery had made her a \"less materialistic person\".",
      "Soon after the incident her sister Khloe told The Ellen DeGeneres Show that, for safety reasons, the Kardashian family were making some changes to how freely they posted on social media.",
      "\"The biggest change was her security detail,\" KJ Matthews told the BBC.",
      "'They're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is'",
      "Patricia Tourancheau, the author of the book about the heist, said she was \"fascinated\" by the \"clash between these old-style burglars from the Parisian banlieue and this global social media star\".",
      "\"They fled on bikes and she flies around on private jets,\" she laughed.",
      "\"These are a group of elderly down-and-out thieves, they're always broke, they're forever involved in convoluted plans\u2026 and they're facing a huge celebrity and they don't even know who she is.\"",
      "The gang was not \"elite\" as it was suggested in the early days, she added.",
      "\"This isn't the creme de la creme of French banditry. They're a bit of a bunch of losers, really. They're the same kind of people who in the 60s and 70s would burglar banks or post offices and who then rebranded to drug trafficking and then moved on to jewels because it was easier,\" she said.",
      "Around mid-May, Kim will face the suspects for the first time in years when she takes the stand as a witness.",
      "Cameras are not allowed in French courts but her arrival to the tribunal on Ile de la Cit\u00e9 alone will inevitably spark the same media frenzy that has accompanied her for over a decade.",
      "In his memoir, Abbas expressed the hope the victim's status and the global resonance of the case would not influence judges unduly.",
      "However, he also said that on the last day of the trial he would bring a duffle bag with his belongings, ready to be sent to jail.",
      "\"The problem with the past,\" he wrote, \"is that it sticks with you as long as you live\".",

    "summary": "The impact of what President Trump has done so far is being felt in every corner of American life.",
    "story": [
      "During last year's presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly repeated his intention to bring about dramatic change as soon as he returned to the White House.",
      "But few expected it to come at such breakneck speed.",
      "In the three months since he took the oath of office, the 47th president has deployed his power in a way that compares to few predecessors.",
      "In stacks of bound documents signed off with a presidential pen and policy announcements made in all caps on social media, his blizzard of executive actions has reached into every corner of American life.",
      "To his supporters, the shock-and-awe approach has been a tangible demonstration of an all-action president, delivering on his promises and enacting long-awaited reforms.",
      "But his critics fear he is doing irreparable harm to the country and overstepping his powers - crippling important government functions and perhaps permanently reshaping the presidency in the process.",
      "Here are six turning points from the first 100 days.",
      "A social media post sets off a constitutional firestorm",
      "For once, it wasn't a Trump social media post that sparked an outcry.",
      "Three weeks into the new term, at 10.13am on a Sunday morning, Vice-President JD Vance wrote nine words that signalled a strategy which has since shaped the Trump administration's second term.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he declared on X.",
      "In the media frenzy that followed, legal experts lined up to challenge that assertion, pointing to a 220-year-old principle which lies at the heart of American democracy.",
      "Courts have the power to check and strike down any government action - laws, regulations and executive orders - they think violates the US Constitution.",
      "Vance's words represented a brazen challenge to judicial authority and, more broadly, the system of three co-equal branches of government crafted by America's founders.",
      "But Trump and his team remain unapologetic in extending the reach of the executive branch into the two other domains - Congress and the courts.",
      "The White House has moved aggressively to wrest control of spending from Congress, unilaterally defunding programmes and entire agencies.",
      "This erosion of its power has been largely met by silence on Capitol Hill, where Trump's Republicans hold slim majorities in both chambers.",
      "The courts have been more resistant, with well over 100 rulings so far halting presidential actions they deem to be unconstitutional, according to a tally by the New York Times.",
      "Some of the biggest clashes have been over Trump's immigration crackdown. In March, more than 200 Venezuelans deemed a danger to the US, were deported to El Salvador, many under sweeping wartime powers and without the usual process of evidence being presented in court.",
      "A Republican-appointed judge on a federal appeals court said he was \"shocked\" by how the White House had acted.",
      "\"Now the branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,\" Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote.",
      "Trump and White House officials have said they will obey court rulings, even as the president lambasts many of the judges who issue them and the administration at times moves slowly to fully comply.",
      "It all amounts to a unique test of a constitutional system that for centuries has operated under a certain amount of good faith.",
      "While Trump has been at the centre of this push, one of his principal agents of chaos is a man who wasn't born in the US, but who built a business empire there.",
      "Brandishing a chainsaw, dressed in black",
      "Elon Musk, dressed in black from head to toe and wearing sunglasses, stood centre stage and basked in the adulation of the Conservative Political Action Conference crowd.",
      "The richest man in the world, who wants to cut trillions of dollars from the federal government, said he had a special surprise.",
      "Argentinian President Javier Milei, known for his own budget-slashing, emerged from backstage and handed him a shiny gold chainsaw.",
      "\"This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy,\" Musk exclaimed. \"CHAINSAW!!\"",
      "It was a dramatic illustration not only of Musk's enthusiasm for his \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (Doge) assignment, but also of the near rock-star status that the South African-born technologist has developed among the Trump faithful.",
      "Since that appearance, Musk has dispatched his operatives across the federal government, pushing to access sensitive government databases and identify programmes to slash.",
      "Although he has not come anywhere near to finding the trillions of dollars of waste he once promised, his cuts have drastically reduced dozens of agencies and departments - essentially shutting down the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and attempting to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "While pledges to cut \"waste, fraud and abuse\" in government and trim the ballooning federal deficit typically have broad appeal, the manner in which Musk has used his metaphorical chainsaw has led to conflict with senior government officials and stoked anger among some of the American public.",
      "Some Trump supporters may approve of the administration's aggressive budget-cutting but other constituents have berated Republican legislators at town hall events.",
      "Hecklers have expressed fear that the cuts will adversely affect popular government programmes like Social Security retirement plans, veterans benefits, and health insurance coverage for the poor and elderly.",
      "Their concerns may not be entirely misplaced, given that these schemes make up the bulk of federal spending.",
      "If these programmes are not cut back, sweeping tax cuts that Trump has promised would further increase the scale of US government debt and put at risk arguably his biggest election promise - economic prosperity.",
      "'I had to think fast as billions was lost before my eyes'",
      "When trader Richard McDonald saw Trump hold up his charts in the White House Rose Garden showing a list of countries targeted by US tariffs, he knew he had to act fast.",
      "\"I jumped to my feet because I wasn't expecting a board [of charts] - I was expecting an announcement,\" he says.",
      "McDonald expected tariff cuts of 10% or 20%, but says \"nobody expected these huge numbers\".",
      "He raced to understand which companies might be worst hit. Then he sold.",
      "\"There are billions being wiped off share prices every second, so it's really 'fastest finger first'.\"",
      "He is one of the many traders who were at the coal face of global markets when share prices plunged everywhere following Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.",
      "The S&P 500 index of the largest firms listed in the US was hit particularly hard - and even though the White House has reversed course on some of the highest tariffs, it hasn't fully recovered since.",
      "The economy was the biggest concern for US voters in November's election, and Trump rode a tide of deep unhappiness over Biden's handling of inflation all the way to victory.",
      "His pledge to cut prices, pare back government regulation and boost homegrown industry was a pro-business message warmly welcomed on Wall Street and by many working Americans.",
      "But as Trump tries to follow through on his promise of new tariffs, the economic costs, at least in the short term, have become painfully apparent.",
      "The stock market is sinking, interest rates - including for home mortgages - are rising, and consumer confidence is down. Unemployment is also ticking up, in part due to the growing number of federal employees forced out of their jobs.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank, along with economic experts, warn Trump's plan will shrink economic growth and possibly lead to a recession.",
      "While the president's approval ratings on his handling of the economy have tumbled, many of his supporters are sticking with him. And in former industrial areas hollowed out by the loss of manufacturing jobs, there are hopes that tariffs could even the global playing field.",
      "\"Trump has earned back the respect,\" says truck driver Ben Maurer in Pennsylvania, referring to tariffs on China. \"We are still the force to be reckoned with.\"",
      "Economic concerns have contributed to Trump's overall decline in the polls, but in one key area, he is still largely on solid ground in the public's eye - immigration.",
      "Spotted in a photo - 'My son, shackled in prison'",
      "\"It's him! It's him! I recognise his features,\" says Myrelis Casique Lopez, pointing at a photo of men shackled and cuffed on the floor of one of the most infamous prisons in the world.",
      "She had spotted her son in the image, taken from above, of a sea of shaven heads belonging to men in white T-shirts sat in long, straight rows.",
      "At home in Maracay, Venezuela, Ms Casique was shown the photograph, first shared online by the El Salvador authorities, by a BBC reporter.",
      "When she last had contact with her son, he was in the US and facing deportation to Venezuela but now he was 1,430 miles (2,300 km) away from her, one of 238 men sent by US authorities to a notorious mega-jail in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration says they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang - a powerful, multi-national crime operation - but Ms Casique insists her son is innocent.",
      "A tough stance on immigration was a central plank of Trump's re-election campaign, and the president has used his broad powers of enforcement to deliver that pledge.",
      "Illegal border crossings were falling at the end of the Biden presidency, but are now at their lowest monthly total for more than four years.",
      "A majority of the US public still backs the crackdown, but it has had a chilling effect on communities of foreign students who have found themselves caught up in the blitz.",
      "Some, including permanent residents, have been detained and face deportation because of their role in pro-Palestinian campus protests. They have rejected accusations that they support Hamas.",
      "Civil rights lawyers warn that some migrants are being deported without due process, sweeping up the innocent among the \"killers and thugs\" that Trump says are being targeted.",
      "While so far there haven't been the level of mass deportations that some hoped for and others feared, newly empowered immigration enforcement agents have taken action across the US in businesses, homes and churches.",
      "They have been active in universities too, which have become a prominent target of President Trump in several other ways.",
      "A clash with academic, media and corporate worlds",
      "On 21 April, Harvard University's president, Alan Garber, decided to confront the White House head-on.",
      "In a letter to the university community, he announced a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to freeze billions of dollars in federal grants.",
      "It was, he said, an illegal attempt to \"impose unprecedented and improper control\" over Harvard's operations.",
      "The White House said it had to take action because Harvard had not tackled antisemitism on campus - an issue that Garber said the university was taking steps to address.",
      "But the Ivy League college's move was the most prominent display of resistance against Trump's use of presidential power to target American higher education, a longstanding goal energised by pro-Palestinian protests that engulfed campuses in 2024.",
      "The president and his officials have since impounded or threatened to withhold billions of dollars in federal spending to reshape elite institutions like Harvard, which the president and many of his supporters think push a liberal ideology on students and researchers.",
      "Earlier in the month, Columbia University in New York City had agreed to a number of White House demands, including changes to its protest policies, campus security practices and Middle Eastern studies department.",
      "A similar dynamic has played out in the corporate and media worlds.",
      "Trump has used the withholding of federal contracts as a way to pressure law firms to recruit and represent more conservatives.",
      "Some of the firms have responded by offering the Trump administration millions of dollars in free legal services, while two firms have filed suit challenging the constitutionality of the administration's punishments.",
      "A defamation lawsuit Trump brought against ABC News has led to the media company contributing $15m (\u00a311m) to Trump's presidential foundation.",
      "CBS is also in talks to settle a separate lawsuit over a Kamala Harris interview, as its parent company Paramount seeks federal approval for a merger with Skydance Media.",
      "The Associated Press, by contrast, has resisted administration pressure to accept Trump's \"Gulf of America\" name change despite the White House's efforts to block the news agency from coverage of the president.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump warned about the runaway power of the federal government. Now in office, he is wielding that power in a way no previous modern president has attempted.",
      "Nowhere, however, have the impacts of his efforts been more visible than within the federal government agencies and departments that he now controls.",
      "A retreat on race and identity",
      "The press conference at the White House began with a moment's silence for the victims of an aircraft collision over the Potomac River.",
      "Within seconds of the pause coming to an end, however, Trump was on the attack.",
      "A diversity and inclusion initiative at the Federal Aviation Agency was partly to blame for the tragedy, the president claimed, because it hired people with severe intellectual disabilities as air traffic controllers. He did not provide any evidence.",
      "It was a startling moment that was emblematic of the attack his presidency has launched against inclusivity programmes that have proliferated in recent years across the US government and corporate world.",
      "Trump has directed the federal government to end its diversity and equity (DEI) programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\".",
      "His directive has accelerated moves among leading global companies like Meta and Goldman to cut back or eliminate these programmes.",
      "First introduced in the 1960s in the wake of civil rights victories, early forms of DEI were an attempt to expand opportunities for black Americans. They later expanded to take in women, LGBT rights and other racial groups.",
      "Efforts were stepped up and embraced by much of corporate America in the wake of the 2020 Black Lives Matters protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis Police officers.",
      "But to its critics, DEI was putting politics and race above talent, creating division and was no longer needed in modern America.",
      "While Trump's directive seems to have support from a narrow majority of voters, some of the unexpected consequences have raised eyebrows.",
      "Arlington National Cemetery scrubbed from its website all mentions of the history of black and female service members. And the Enola Gay aircraft that dropped an atomic bomb on Japan was initially flagged for removal from Pentagon documents, apparently due to the word \"gay\".",
      "Donald Trump's first 100 days have been an unprecedented display of unilateral power exercised by a modern American president.",
      "His efforts to dismantle large swaths of the federal government will take years, if not decades, for subsequent presidents to restore - if they so desire.",
      "In other ways, however, Trump's efforts so far may end up being less permanent. Without the support of new laws passed by Congress, many of his sweeping reforms could be wiped away by a future president.",
      "And so to what extent this whirlwind start leads to lasting change remains an open question.",
      "Later this year, the narrow Republican majorities in Congress will attempt to provide the legislative backing for Trump's agenda, but their success is far from guaranteed.",
      "And in next year's mid-term congressional elections, those majorities could be replaced by hostile Democrats bent on investigating the administration and curtailing his authority.",
      "Meanwhile, more court battles loom - and while the US Supreme Court has a conservative tilt, its decisions on a number of key cases could ultimately cut against Trump's efforts.",
      "The first 100 days of Trump's second term have been a dramatic show of political force, but the next 1,361 will be the real test of whether he can carve an enduring legacy.",

      "For Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.",
      "Running the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.",
      "Burnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.",
      "Streaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.",
      "A once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.",
      "As a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.",
      "Health has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.",
      "But experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.",
      "Australians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.",
      "The cracks in a 'national treasure'",
      "Healthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.",
      "Seeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.",
      "Though she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.",
      "\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"",
      "When Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".",
      "Health funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.",

      "But the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.",
      "That is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.",
      "According to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.",

      "When the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.",
      "It means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.",

      "Health economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.",
      "The taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.",
      "\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"",
      "The original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.",
      "She says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need.",
      "Both the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.",
      "\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.",
      "On the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.",
      "\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.",
      "His government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.",
      "But the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill.",
      "Proposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.",
      "One Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.",
      "Labor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".",
      "But many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference.",
      "There's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.",
      "Experts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.",
      "That is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.",

      "Democrats have struggled to land a unified message in President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, with fractures both in Congress and among supporters. What comes next for a party in a difficult spot?",
      "The rural, agricultural town of Bakersfield, California, is an odd stop for a pair of East Coast progressive politicians.",
      "After all, Trump won the surrounding county by 20 points, and the dusty fields and endless orchards feel a world away from the party's power centres in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.",
      "Yet Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders packed a local auditorium during a recent stop on their Fighting Oligarchy tour. The rally felt like a 1960s-style sit-in with attendees singing along to a gentle rendition of Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land. They launched rowdy boos and jeers every time Sanders inveighed against Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "The visit also felt like an answered prayer for local Democrats and left-leaning Independents who oppose Trump and his policies, while directing much of their fury at their own party, which they feel has failed to mount an effective opposition.",
      "The Democratic party \"should be doing more to try to protect everybody,\" said Karla Alcantar, 26, who attended the rally. \"I feel like some of them have just folded over completely, and there are some that are trying to do the work of all.\"",
      "\"I definitely feel like they should be doing way more,\" she said.",
      "Democrats at a crossroads",
      "It is not a great time to be a Democratic politician in the United States. The party is out of power. Elected officials cannot agree on a course of action to counter Trump's agenda. No clear leader has emerged to unify the unwieldy coalition. Various ideological and generational factions are warring against each other and nobody seems to be winning.",
      "\"I understand that they don't have the power to, like, change like things drastically, but they do have the power to slow down like things even a little bit,\" said rally attendee Juan Dominguez, 26. \"It honestly feels like I'm not seeing any of that.\"",
      "The anger extends beyond the rally-goers.",
      "Fifty-two percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said their party's leadership is moving in the wrong direction, according to a CNN/SSRS poll conducted in mid-March, as opposed to 48% who said it is moving in the right direction.",
      "That same survey suggested a desire for strong opposition: 57% wanted Democrats in Congress to try and stop the Republican party's agenda. It's a complete reversal of a poll in 2017, the year after Trump first won the presidency, that suggested 74% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted leaders to work with Republicans following a divisive election.",
      "\"What they're pressing for is not just Democratic leaders to lash out because that's going to make their followers feel good,\" said former Pennsylvania congressman Conor Lamb, who held a town hall-style event in Pittsburgh last week.",
      "Though Lamb said he is not currently running for office, he felt a hunger within the Democratic base.",
      "\"I think they feel like the survival of the system we have all counted on is itself on the line, and they want us to act with that level of urgency,\" Lamb told the BBC. \"I think it's important for us not to forget just to be advocates for things that are specific and concrete, and really affecting people.\"",
      "Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's tour is just one attempt to solve that. It stops in conservative-dominated areas and remains laser-focused on the economy, citing cost of living grievances that propelled Trump to a second term, while framing him and his billionaire supporters like Musk as the culprits.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez put the argument simply: \"Oligarchy or democracy?\"",
      "But the Fighting Oligarchy tour is only one theory about how the Democratic Party should evolve.",
      "\"It is completely normal when a party loses, especially the presidency, for there to be this period of soul searching and asking, 'What's next?'\" said Professor Christian Grose, a political scientist at the University of Southern California.",
      "Some Democrats accused their party of falling out of step with more conservative Americans on subjects like transgender rights, or failing to accommodate diverse viewpoints within the party's ideological spectrum. Without widening their potential base, these Democrats argue, they stand little chance of regaining power.",
      "One such gambit by California Governor Gavin Newsom involves moving the party's branding more to the center. Though Newsom has long brushed off White House ambitions, he is among a new generation of Democrats who could vie for the presidency in 2028.",
      "The governor, known nationwide as a liberal defender of abortion and LGBTQ rights, recently launched a podcast to host conversations with politicos who disagree with him.",
      "Newsom's decision to interview right-wing strategist Steve Bannon infuriated many Democrats.",
      "\"I think it's important to have difficult conversations or even have a civil conversation that may be difficult for people to listen to, because everyone is out there trying to tear each other down,\" Newsom said at a recent press conference.",
      "New guard or old guard?",
      "While such debates over whether to moderate or play to the base feature in every party's soul-searching, this year does have a new twist, Mr Grose noted.",
      "\"Some of the questions for the Democrats' strategy is the age question - is it time for a new generation? That is a little unique,\" he said.",
      "David Hogg, 25, a gun safety organiser and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, is currently locked in a heated public debate with a party elder statesmen, strategist James Carville.",
      "Hogg recently pledged $20m through his political group to fund primary challengers to Democrats in safe seats.",
      "\"We cannot win back the majority if we do not convince the American people that our party offers something that isn't just, not Donald Trump, but something substantially better,\" he said. \"I think it's time for some new voices in our party.\"",
      "Carville, credited with shepherding Bill Clinton to the White House, called the plan \"insane.\"",
      "\"Aren't we supposed to run against Republicans?\" he asked on CNN.",

      "\"President Trump is trying to break us so that America could own us,\" the Liberal leader warned.",
      "\"Never,\" supporters shouted back. Many waved Canadian flags taped to ice hockey sticks.",
      "Similar levels of passion were also on display at the union hall where Pierre Poilievre greeted enthusiastic supporters in the Toronto area earlier in the week.",
      "The Conservative leader has drawn large crowds to rallies across the country, where \"Bring it Home\" is a call to arms: both to vote for a change of government and a nod to the wave of Canadian patriotism in the face of US tariff threats.",
      "In the final hours of a 36-day campaign, Donald Trump's shadow looms over everything. The winner of Monday's election is likely to be the party able to convince voters they have a plan for how to deal with the US president.",
      "National polls suggest the Liberals have maintained a narrow lead entering last stretch.",
      "Still, Trump is not the only factor at play - he was only mentioned once in Poilievre's stump speech.",
      "The Conservative leader has focused more on voters disaffected by what he calls a \"Lost Liberal decade\", promising change from a government he blames for the housing shortage and a sluggish economy, and for mishandling social issues like crime and the fentanyl crisis.",
      "His pitch resonates with voters like Eric and Carri Gionet, from Barrie, Ontario. They have two daughters in their mid-20s and said they were attending their first ever political rally.",
      "\"We're pretty financially secure - but I worry about them,\" said Eric Gionet. While he and his wife could buy their first home while young, he said, \"there's no prospect\" their children will be able to do the same.",

      "Tapping into voter frustration has helped opposition parties sweep governments from power in democracies around the world. Canada seemed almost certain to follow suit.",
      "Last year, the Conservatives held a 20-point lead in national polls over the governing Liberals for months. Poilievre's future as the country's next prime minister seemed baked in.",
      "Then a series of shockwaves came in quick succession at the start of 2025, upending the political landscape: Justin Trudeau's resignation, Carney's subsequent rise to Liberal leader and prime minister; and the return of Trump to the White House with the threats and tariffs that followed.",
      "By the time the election was called in mid-March, Carney's Liberals were polling neck-and-neck with the Conservatives, and by early April they had pulled slightly ahead, national surveys suggest.",
      "It has been a stunning reversal of fortunes. Seemingly dead and buried, the Liberals now believe they could win a fourth successive election, and even a majority in Parliament.",
      "Carney is pitching himself as the man most ready to meet this critical moment - a steady central banker who helped shepherd Canada's economy through the 2008 financial crisis and later, the UK through Brexit.",
      "For Conservative voter Gwendolyn Slover, 69, from Summerside in the province of Prince Edward Island, his appeal is \"baffling\".",
      "\"Many people think Mark Carney is some kind of Messiah,\" she said. \"It's the same party, he's one person. And he's not going to change anything.\"",
      "For Carney's supporters, they see a strong CV and a poise that has calmed their anxieties over Trump's threats of steep tariffs and repeated suggestions the country should become the 51st US state - though the president has been commenting less frequently on Canada during the campaign.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by the stability and the serious thought process of Mark Carney,\" said Mike Brennan from Kitchener, Ontario, as he stood in line to meet the Liberal leader at a coffee shop in Cambridge, about an hour outside Toronto.",
      "Mr Brennan is a \"lifelong Liberal\" who did not initially plan to vote for the party in this election because of his dislike for Trudeau.",
      "The departure of former prime minister Trudeau, who had grown increasingly unpopular over his decade in power, released \"a massive pressure valve\", said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation.",
      "\"All of these angry Liberals who are either parking their votes with the [left-wing] NDP or parking their votes with the Conservatives start re-coalescing,\" she said.",
      "Then more disaffected Liberals and other progressive voters began to migrate towards Carney's Liberals, driven by Trump, this election's \"main character\", Ms Kurl said.",
      "\"The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters.\"",
      "It has worked to Carney's advantage, with Trump's tariffs threats giving the political neophyte - he is the first prime minister never to have held elected public office - the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign.",
      "Trump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports allowed Carney to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and meeting US Cabinet ministers.",
      "He's never been tested in a gruelling federal election campaign, with its relentless travel, high-pressure demands for retail politics and daily media scrutiny. Yet on the campaign trail, and in the high-stakes debate with party leaders, he is considered to have performed well.",
      "Poilievre, in contrast, is a veteran politician and polished performer. But on the shifting political ground, Conservatives appeared to struggle to find their footing, pivoting their message from Canada being broken to \"Canada First\".",
      "Poilievre had to fend off criticism from political rivals that he is \"Trump lite\", with his combative style, his vows to end \"woke ideology\", and willingness to take on the \"global elite\".",

      "A young female South African doctor has sparked a nationwide conversation about a form of domestic abuse often shrouded in silence - financial abuse.",
      "In a series of viral videos Dr Celiwe Ndaba opened up about how she said she had been financially exploited by her husband, how it had spiralled and led to their separation.",
      "Often sitting in her car on her way to work, the mother of three vlogged over two weeks about how despite her successful career she had become trapped in a toxic marriage for years, feeling manipulated to fund her husband's lifestyle - in particular his desire to drive a Mercedes Benz.",
      "Taking out loans for him to buy such vehicles was the \"worst decision\" of her life, putting the family under huge financial pressure, said Dr Ndaba - who since sharing her story has reverted to using her maiden name and the number of her followers has ballooned.",
      "Despite pleas for her husband to downgrade, she said he refused - accusing her of wanting to \"turn him into a laughing stock by making him drive a small car\".",
      "The medic said she was speaking out as she wanted to issue a warning to others - that it was not only \"uneducated\" and \"less fortunate\" women who find themselves in abusive relationships.",
      "Her estranged husband, Temitope Dada, has not responded to a BBC request for comment.",
      "In the wake of the social media storm, he set up a TikTok account, where in one of his first videos he acknowledged: \"You may know me as\u2026 'Mr Benz or nothing.'\"",
      "The few posts he has made are accompanied by hashtags such as #divorcetrauma - saying the accusations are lies.",
      "Nonetheless, the comments section on Dr Ndaba's TikTok and other social media platforms have transformed into support groups, filled with female breadwinners sharing eerily similar stories.",
      "\"You are brave to speak out so publicly\u2026 I have been suffering in silence,\" one person commented.",
      "Bertus Preller, a lawyer based in Cape Town, believes this is because although South African women are becoming doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs, getting well-paid jobs does not necessarily free them from the clutches of the patriarchy.",
      "Women's financial independence clashes with \"cultural norms that prioritise male authority\", he says.",
      "If anything, their success appears to make them targets.",
      "Financial abuse occurs when one partner dominates or exploits the other's financial resources, the lawyer explains.",
      "\"It is a subtle yet potent tactic of domestic violence, aimed at keeping the victim under control,\" he says.",
      "In South Africa, this is legally classified as economic abuse under the Domestic Violence Act.",
      "Mr Preller says things like \"unjustly withholding money for essentials or interfering with shared assets,\" are covered by the act.",
      "A university lecturer, who requested anonymity, told the BBC how her husband had lied about his qualifications and eventually left her in financial ruin.",
      "It started with her car that he mostly drove but never refuelled. Then loans she took out for his multiple failed business ventures. Finally, there came an eviction notice as she said he had stopped contributing towards rent, leaving her to shoulder all the expenses for their family, which included three children.",
      "Despite this, they stayed together for close to a decade - even though he was also physically abusive.",
      "\"He's very smart... I was in love with his smartness, his big dreams. But he couldn't follow them up with actions. His pride was his downfall,\" she said.",
      "Even when he managed to get some money, he still did not contribute.",
      "\"He started withholding whatever money he had for himself. He'd go out drinking with his friends, come back - the salary is gone,\" she said.",
      "Legal financial expert Somila Gogoba says that beyond the control of money, financial abuse often has deep psychological roots.",
      "\"For the abuser, this behaviour may stem from feelings of inadequacy, fear of abandonment, or the need for dominance,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"For the victim, the psychological impact includes feelings of worthlessness, fear, and dependence, which can be paralysing.\"",
      "Research from the University of South Africa suggests these are not isolated cases \u2013 and that women who out-earn their partners face significantly higher risks of intimate partner violence.",
      "Out of their in-depth study of 10 women who were the primary breadwinners of their families, only two were married.",
      "\"For eight of the participants, their choice of being single resulted from their experiences of physical, emotional and sexual violence\u2026 All the women said they believed that their role as female breadwinners was viewed as threatening to the traditional male role of a provider,\" said researcher Bianca Parry.",
      "Ms Gogoba says female breadwinners are less valued than their male counterparts, despite their economic contributions: \"This cultural backdrop can encourage some partners to feel entitled to control the finances, even when they do not contribute equally.",
      "\"This control is not just about money - it is also about power and maintaining a grip on the relationship dynamics.\"",
      "Nombulelo Shange, sociologist lecturer at the University of the Free State, says it is part of a growing pattern in South Africa of middle-class women being financially exploited.",
      "\"Black women face a double patriarchy: Western expectations at work, traditional expectations at home. When these collide, harmful ideologies escalate,\" she told the BBC.",
      "She explained that balancing the pressures of being a successful woman, but playing the role of \"the caregiver, the mother, the good wife, the good neighbour and community member who goes to church every Sunday\", was difficult as women were always taught to tiptoe around men's egos.",
      "Since Dr Ndaba's revelations, women on social media have shared stories of giving their male partners their debit or credit cards when they go out to eat so it appears as though he is paying for the meal.",
      "For Dr Shange this shows how the burden of a happy home is often placed on the woman's shoulders.",
      "\"You think: 'If I just get them a car, they'll be happy.' Love makes you blind. When your person struggles, you struggle too - you want to fix it,\" she said.",
      "By the time the university lecturer divorced her husband, she was left with debts of 140,000 rand ($7,500; \u00a35,600) - all racked up in her name.",
      "\"Before, I could plan things like holidays. Now they are a luxury,\" she said.",
      "Dr Ndaba has been at pains to tell her followers, as she did on one vlog: \"Finance is an important aspect of people's marriages.\"",

    "summary": "The so-called \"Granddad Gang\" is on trial for allegedly tying up Kim Kardashian in a Paris residence in 2016 and stealing millions of dollars' worth of jewelry.",
    "story": [
      "A trial over the 2016 heist in which armed robbers tied up reality star Kim Kardashian in her bedroom and stole millions of dollars' worth of jewelry has begun in Paris.",
      "Ten people \u2014 nine men and a woman \u2014 are on trial on charges of robbery and kidnapping of the media personality and the concierge of the residence where she was staying on the night of Oct. 2, 2016. Two of them acknowledged their participation and the others denied it.",
      "Kardashian was in France for Fashion Week when men dressed as police officers allegedly tied her up with zip ties and duct tape, held her at gunpoint and stole $10 million worth of jewelry, including a $4 million diamond ring given to her by her then-husband Kanye West.",
      "In interviews and on her family's reality TV show, Kardashian described being terrified, thinking she was going to be raped and killed when the criminals broke into her bedroom and pointed a gun at her.",
      "\"They dragged me out to the hallway on top of the stairs, that's when I saw the gun like clear as day,\" she said on her show, \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\" \"It makes me so upset thinking about it.\"",
      "Her lawyers said she will testify in person at the trial, with a provisional schedule showing that is expected to happen on May 13. The trial is scheduled to run through May 23.",
      "\"Ms. Kardashian is reserving her testimony for the court and jury and does not wish to elaborate further at this time,\" they said. \"She has great respect and admiration for the French justice system and has been treated with great respect by the French authorities. She wishes the trial to proceed in an orderly fashion, in accordance with French law and with respect for all parties to the case.\"",
      "Twelve people were originally expected in the defendants' box. One of them died and another is seriously ill and can't be tried. According to the investigation, five of the 10 defendants were present at the scene of the robbery.",
      "The \"Granddad Robbers\"",
      "The French press has dubbed them The Granddad Robbers because the main defendants are older \u2014 most in their 60s and 70s \u2014 and have been bank robbers with long criminal records.",
      "The DNA of two of the accused was found at the scene, and they have admitted taking part in the robbery.",
      "Aomar Ait Khedache, now aged 69, was allegedly the mastermind behind the heist.",
      "Known as \"Old Omar\", he reportedly told investigators he had no idea who Kardashian was but had heard from a waiter friend about the amazing jewelry she wore when she was out dining in Paris.",
      "When the robbers arrived at the luxury suites hotel known only as \"The No Address\" where the celebrity was staying during Paris Fashion Week, they allegedly demanded the guard, at gunpoint, direct them to \"the rapper's wife\" \u2013 a reference to her then-husband, West.",
      "\"Old Omar\" reportedly wrote to Kardashian in 2017, when he was in custody, to say sorry. Her lawyers said he wrote to apologize after he heard her speak of how traumatic the experience had been.",
      "He left the hotel on a bicycle, as did two others, then met his son, who was waiting for him in a parked car at a nearby train station.",
      "The other man \u2014 77-year-old Yunice Abbas \u2014 has publicly admitted to being a lookout during the robbery.",
      "He said he was unarmed and did not personally threaten Kardashian, but admitted he shared responsibility for the crime.",
      "In 2021, he co-authored a French-language book titled \"I Sequestered Kim Kardashian.\"",
      "Abbas told reporters that he will apologize during the trial and will give details of his role in the heist but won't denounce anyone else.",
      "The other defendants are suspected of providing information about Kardashian's presence in the apartment. Others are accused of playing a role in the resale of the jewelry in Antwerp, Belgium.",
      "The gangsters stole many pieces of jewelry. Only one piece of jewelry \u2014 a diamond cross on platinum that was lost during the suspects' escape \u2014 has been recovered.",
      "Celebrity status could distract from trial",
      "As the trial opened Monday, lawyers for the accused told reporters outside the court that they were concerned that Kardashian's fame would distract from the essentials of the case.",
      "\"It's a simple case with people who will accept responsibility, who regret what they've done,\" said Frank Berton, lawyer for Khedache.",
      "Another of his lawyers, Chloe Arnoux, told reporters: \"He is, in fact, rather worried about seeing all you journalists, because he is afraid that his case will not be treated the same way it would be if there were not such a famous person involved in it.\"",
      "The lawyer for night watchman Abderrahmane Ouatiki told journalists on his way into court that he was tired of suggestions that the robbers who allegedly forced his client at gunpoint to direct them to Kardashian's suite were \"kind old men.\"",
      "\"The people in front of him that day were not Robin Hoods, they were experienced, determined criminals who did not hesitate to threaten him while he was working nights to finance his studies,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:07:09 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter - subject of the new Broadway musical \"Just in Time\" - was renowned for such pop hits as \"Splish Splash,\" \"Mack the Knife,\" and \"Dream Lover.\" But his life was unsettled when he learned, at age 32, the startling truth about the identity of his mother.",
    "story": [
      "Bobby Darin was a major pop star \u2026 a singer, dancer, musician, and an Oscar nominee. He was the entertainer who did it all, except Broadway. Until now!",
      "Tony Award-winner Jonathan Groff (\"Merrily We Roll Along\") plays the icon of the late 1950s and '60s in the musical \"Just in Time.\" \"He was at the height of his powers, when he was on the floor of a nightclub with the audience in the palm of his hand,\" said Groff.",
      "For Darin, a live audience was oxygen. So, too, for Groff: \"You can feel this vibration between performer and audience member. [It's], to me, the most essential thing to ignite in the telling of his story.\"",
      "It's taken seven years and a whole lot of sweat to bring the show to Broadway. The casting of Groff \u2013 beloved for his roles on stage, and as Kristoff in the \"Frozen\" movies \u2013 might not seem obvious. Groff grew up on a horse farm in Pennsylvania Mennonite country; Darin was a scrappy Italian kid from the Bronx.",
      "I asked Groff to whom he liked listening when he was growing up. \"I am in fourth or fifth grade, on the computer or Nintendo in the basement, blasting Ethel Merman, 'Annie Get Your Gun,'\" he laughed.",
      "\"So, this is the 1990s, probably? And you're playing something from the 1940s?\"",
      "\"Exactly!\"",
      "Likewise, Bobby Darin was an old soul, says his son, Dodd Darin. \"He admired, he loved, he respected the old timers. He loved that era of show business. That's what he related to.\"",
      "That may have had something to do with the woman who raised him: \"Polly, his mother, was an old vaudevillian,\" said Dodd. \"And she nurtured him and said, 'You can't play stickball in the street. And you can't roughhouse with kids' ('cause he was frail and sickly). 'But you can learn to sing. You can learn to dance. You can learn to play piano.' And it opened a whole world.\"",
      "\"Frail and sickly\" was no exaggeration. Born Walden Robert Cassotto, Darin suffered several bouts of rheumatic fever as a child, permanently damaging his heart. When he was a boy, he overheard a family doctor say that he wouldn't live beyond his teenage years. \"Put yourself in that position,\" said Dodd. \"So, he was ambitious. He was driven. He was always on the go. He was trying to jam it all in, 'cause he knew he didn't have time.\"",
      "With no time to waste, he began writing songs, and at 22, Bobby Darin made waves with a recording of \"Splish Splash.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Splish Splash\" (1958):",
      "Not one to play it safe, for his second album, in 1959, Darin took a dark ballad from the German \"Threepenny Opera\" and made it swing. \"When my dad took 'Mack the Knife' before it was released and had Dick Clark listen to it, he said, 'Why are you doing this? This is gonna bomb!'\" Dodd said.",
      "It won the Grammy for record of the year, and became the biggest hit of Darin's career.",
      "The next year, he was on his way to Italy to make his motion picture debut opposite America's sweetheart, Sandra Dee. \"We hit it right off,\" Darin said. \"She hated me and I loved her, and that was it.\"",
      "The teen idol married the teen movie star in December of 1960, and welcomed their son, Dodd, a year later. Dodd would later write, \"My father made his destiny. Destiny made my mother.\"",
      "What did he mean by that? \"Well, my mom went through a lot,\" he said. \"Never really wanted fame. She really didn't crave it. It just sort of happened. Unlike my dad, who loved performing, loved show business.\"",
      "Dee was looking for a home life, said Dodd, but Bobby Darin wasn't ready to slow down. The marriage ended after six years. Darin never stopped playing the clubs.",
      "Sammy Davis Jr. once said that Bobby Darin was the one person he wouldn't want to have to follow. \"Absolutely true,\" said Dodd. \"My dad idolized Sammy.\"",
      "The feeling was mutual, as seen in a 1959 broadcast of \"This Is Your Life\":",
      "Also featured during the episode was Nina, the woman Darin thought was his sister. But almost a decade later he would learn a long-held family secret: Nina was in fact Bobby's mother, having given birth to him out of wedlock as a teenager. Which made Polly, the woman he thought was his mother, his grandmother. \"He was never the same,\" said Dodd. \"He said that his whole life was a lie; he was, like, a fraud. It's just devastating. There's no sugarcoating it.\"",
      "Looking at that tape today, says Dodd, it all seems obvious. \"That's a mother's love,\" he said. \"That's not a sister, okay? That's the adulation of, 'This is my son,' but you can't say it.\"",
      "Dodd, who was seven years old when his father found out, remembers a change in your father from that time: \"I'm not gonna say it's directly attributed to that incident; I'm sure that's part of it. But he got into the Bob Darin stage, you know? He took off his toupee. No more tuxedo. Started doing folk music, protest music, writing music, and dropped out of show business for a while.",
      "\"And that was some of the best times I had with him. He was a regular dude. We were up in Big Sur in a trailer, hanging out. And yeah, he let his hair down, if you will. It was good times.\"",
      "Bobby Darin performs \"Simple Song of Freedom\" (1970):",
      "In December of 1973, Bobby Darin's heart finally gave out. He was 37. Dodd had just turned 12. Now 63, Dodd Darin is grateful that, with the new Broadway show, a new generation can learn the story of his father.",
      "\"It's so beautiful that all these years later \u2013 he's been gone over 50 years \u2013 we're here talking about him. We're remembering him,\" said Dodd. \"He did something right.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 27 Apr 2025 09:38:13 -0400",
    "summary": "In 1925, a tragic tale of striving featuring an enigmatic millionaire was published \u2013 and it bombed. Since then, its reputation has only grown, to where many consider \"The Great Gatsby\" the Great American Novel.",
    "story": [
      "Dotting the water's edge of Long Island's Manhasset Bay, the opulence of the homes speaks for itself. But not nearly as well as F. Scott Fitzgerald once spoke of that opulence:",
      "\"A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other, like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling.\"",
      "That \"wedding cake\" of a ceiling, in a home now owned by Elena and George Schietinger, likely did look down on Gatsbyesque parties back in the day. \"I can almost hear the music playing and feel the spirits of the parties that went on here,\" said Elena.",
      "\"The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo.\"",
      "Fitzgerald lived in a much more modest house just a few miles away when he was writing \"The Great Gatsby.\" The Schietingers, though, believe the author must have visited here. They imagine him, while tilting his head back to down a bootleg cocktail, and taking note, and then writing their ceiling into his novel. \"I absolutely believe that to be true,\" said George.",
      "Fitzgerald's novel came out a hundred years ago this month. Scholars consider it a literary masterpiece. Hollywood finds it irresistible, and so does Broadway. There's even a recent graphic novel of \"Gatsby\" that brings Fitzgerald's characters to life, starting with James Gatz, who believed he was too poor to marry the rich girl of his dreams \u2013 and so he reinvents himself. It's less about love, and more about longing \u2013 his especially, for Daisy Buchanan just across the bay.",
      "They were so near, and yet worlds apart.",
      "\"I hadn't realized that either side of the bay, that they were so close to one another,\" said Blake Hazard, the great-granddaughter of Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. \"I mean, you almost could look into the windows on the other side.\"",
      "She says her celebrated relatives are looming lovingly large on this centennial. \"I've gotten used to witnessing these kinds of things about my family, about my great-grandfather with other people, sharing it, and I think that feels right,\" Hazard said.",
      "Gatsby Tours have become popular, including one run by Kevin C. Fitzpatrick, an author and New York historian.",
      "\"There's a point we're in the middle of Manhasset Bay, and you can look to the left to West Egg and to the right to East Egg, and \u2013 it clicks,\" he said, \"because they can picture that green light on that dock.\"",
      "Few of those mansions remain \u2013 most never survived the Great Depression, torn down to make room for the new.",
      "From the archives: Death of the \"Great Gatsby House\" (YouTube Video)",
      "But back in Manhattan, some of the Gatsby lore remains, especially at the Plaza Hotel and its revolving doors. \"There are stories that Zelda would come in here and just go around and around and around,\" Hazard said.",
      "It was a temple to the times, where important people did important things, including Hazard's great-grandparents. \u00a0\"They both really wanted to be in the world, of the world, writing about what they saw, chronicling it all \u2026 and having a great time doing it,\" she said.",
      "The Fitzgeralds were not wealthy themselves. While they did enjoy money, they were amused with its perils, too.",
      "\"They were careless people, Tom and Daisy. They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money, or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together.\"",
      "Hazard said, \"He was drawn to these things, but also very much an observer of them; he felt very outside of, certainly, the wealthy set.\"",
      "Fitzgerald did rub elbows with the wealthy set at Princeton University. Although he later dropped out, his papers found their way back, including the only surviving handwritten manuscript of \"Gatsby,\" which Emma Sarconi, a rare book librarian at Princeton's Special Collections at the Firestone Library, showed us.",
      "\"Here we have half a page scribbled out. The whole book is like this,\" she said.",
      "At the time, Fitzgerald was coming off two big hits: \"This Side of Paradise\" and \"The Beautiful and Damned.\" He believed that \"Gatsby\" would surpass both of them. But \"Gatsby\" landed with a thud, selling less than 20,000 copies. And according to Sarconi, the mixed reviews left him devastated: \"He wrote a letter to his daughter, Scottie, sort of in his final years, lamenting the fact that none of her friends would know who he was,\" she said.",
      "So, what changed? The times, perhaps. During World War II, the newly-formed Council on Books in Wartime shipped millions of pocket-sized books to keep the troops entertained overseas, including 155,000 copies of \"The Great Gatsby.\"\u00a0 \"We wouldn't be talking about this book today if this edition hadn't come out,\" Sarconi said.",
      "Fitzgerald had died long before that, at the age of 44. At that point he thought that he was a failure. \"He had really fallen into obscurity,\" said Sarconi. \"Famously, very few people attended his funeral.\"",
      "And yet today, \"Gatsby\" rubs dust jackets with the likes of Jane Austen, John Steinbeck and Ernest Hemingway. For many, \"The Great Gatsby\" is indeed the Great American Novel.",
      "\"It sounds silly, but I wish Scott could be here, I just think he'd be so thrilled,\" said Hazard, \"and surprised. Certainly surprised!\"",
      "Among the few keepsakes that Blake has are a necklace given to Zelda by Scott, as well as a ring. Is it a coincidence the stone is green? We'll never know.",
      "Still, that haunting green light still blinks for all of us; dreams, perfection, whatever eludes us \u2013 we keep trying.",
      "\"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly, into the past.\"",

    "summary": "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said there is a \"void of data\" on the COVID booster shots.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that the agency is now looking at whether it will still approve COVID-19 vaccines for next winter, citing a lack of data on booster shots.",
      "\"We're taking a look. I can't comment on any particular application. As you know, we have a bunch of applications for those booster shots,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett.",
      "Makary said many health care workers did not get the last round of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, calling it \"a bit of a public trust problem.\"",
      "\"I think there's a void of data. And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data,\" Makary said.",
      "His answer marks a change from during the Biden administration, when FDA officials backed plans to routinely update the COVID-19 vaccines each year.",
      "Last year, the FDA issued guidance on what strain should be targeted by the shots for the following winter. Updates to Moderna and Pfizer's COVID shots for the new strain were approved in August.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also now weighing whether to significantly narrow its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Makary's remarks echo his justification for delaying Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to get full approval on April 1. Novavax said Monday that the FDA had asked the company to commit to another clinical trial of the shot.",
      "\"Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is does it provide a benefit? Without a study on the new formulation and product, we can't give an honest evidence-based answer to that question,\" Makary told the newsletter \"Inside Medicine\" this week.",
      "Multiple companies are now also being asked \"to do clinical studies, a basic clinical study, so we can educate the population and have information to work with,\" Makary told CBS News.",
      "\"It's my general feeling, not with this particular product, which I can't discuss in depth, but with drugs in general, that we need to know if they work today in order to be able to recommend them,\" he said.",
      "He also praised his special assistant, Dr. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg, when asked what role she played in the agency's evaluation of Novavax's application.",
      "\"Dr. H\u00f8eg is an amazing M.D.-Ph.D. who has joined my staff as a special assistant to the commissioner. And she is involved in reviewing data sets at the agency. And I'm really excited to have her in the process,\" Makary said.",
      "Trade industry publication The Pink Sheet previously reported that H\u00f8eg had been asked to step in on Novavax's application. H\u00f8eg was also added to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations, in a slot previously filled by a career vaccines official from the FDA.",
      "Former FDA officials have criticized the agency's new political leadership for their intervention in vaccine approvals, a process which is usually entrusted to career scientific officials.",
      "In a commentary\u00a0published this week, former officials Phil Krause and Luciana Borio called on the FDA to \"stick to its normal processes.\"",
      "\"Shifting standards and late-stage demands for new data \u2014 based on faulty scientific assumptions \u2014 erode trust, delay access to important tools, and discourage developers from advancing vaccine innovation,\" they wrote.",

    "summary": "Some FDA scientists and inspections staff were told that their layoffs may be rescinded.",
    "story": [
      "Food and Drug Administration officials have told some scientists and inspections staff that their layoffs will be reversed, after the job cuts led to disruptions in drug and food safety work.",
      "The move marks a significant reversal of a portion of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs. Kennedy initially planned to cut 3,500 employees from the FDA.",
      "In team-wide meetings that started last week, multiple FDA employees said they were informed by their supervisors that they should expect to have their layoffs reversed.",
      "Among the laid-off staff told they would be brought back are scientists for drug safety labs in Puerto Rico and Detroit as well as food safety labs\u00a0in Chicago and San Francisco. A handful of support staff for the FDA's inspectors are also being brought back.",
      "Multiple FDA scientists said they were eager to go back to work, though they had yet to receive official paperwork for reversing the layoffs.",
      "The New York Times first reported that the FDA's food safety labs were being reinstated.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services blamed errors in the layoffs on inaccurate data from the department's \"siloed HR divisions.\"",
      "\"This is exactly why HHS is reorganizing its administrative functions to streamline operations and fix the broken systems left to us by the Biden Administration. Streamlining this into one operation will allow for enhanced data integrity and coordination,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Kennedy has previously said some layoffs would be walked back, like to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's lead poisoning teams. But that reversal never ended up happening, leaving the agency's lead poisoning work largely abandoned.",
      "Some CDC laboratories also remain closed, including the agency's now-shuttered labs for investigating outbreaks of hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases or for worker safety, like oversight of N95 masks.",
      "FDA inspections falling behind",
      "Around two dozen of the support staff for the FDA's inspectors have been told their layoffs would be reversed, out of nearly 200 who were cut. The employees being restored are focused on booking travel for foreign inspections.",
      "Cuts to the FDA's Office of Inspections and Investigations have taken a steep toll on the agency's inspections, especially for overseas manufacturers of drugs and food products.",
      "A pilot program started under the Biden administration to expand unannounced foreign inspections stalled due to the cuts, multiple officials said. In a recent week, one FDA official said less than 60% of the agency's planned foreign inspections had been completed.",
      "Sidelined inspectors of foreign firms have been asked to find ways to \"pivot to\" local inspections they can do within the U.S. instead, according to internal emails shared with CBS News. More than $700,000 of expenses incurred by inspectors have also yet to be paid, an official said, due to the layoffs to support staff.",
      "Hopes by FDA leaders to increase inspections have also run up against an ongoing federal hiring freeze, officials said, especially as the ranks of supervisors for inspectors have been depleted by early retirements and resignations.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary had initially greenlighted a plan to use contractors to fill the gap, before the department moved to reverse some of the layoffs.",
      "FDA drug safety work stalls",
      "Multiple current and laid-off FDA employees said the abrupt layoffs had resulted in delays and disruptions to the agency's drug safety work. Virtually all the scientists in the FDA's San Juan and Detroit labs were cut, leaving only labs in New York and Irvine, California.",
      "The FDA labs in Detroit and San Juan had also been responsible for checking the shelf life of medical treatments stockpiled by the federal government for the military and pandemics, under a program administered by the Department of Defense.",
      "The layoffs also cut chemists based out of the labs who worked as foreign inspectors for the FDA, often assigned to travel with badge-carrying investigators to help with more complex or urgent frontline inspections of drugmakers.",
      "Some of the agency's work to detect and investigate fraudulent medical products had also effectively stalled, they said, amid complications around transferring the custody of the samples and a backlog of work that predated the April 1 layoffs.",
      "The FDA's labs had already been struggling with new hurdles to purchasing that had slowed their work, as staff waited for weeks in some cases for supply orders, officials said.",

      "\"We are not creating an autism registry. The real-world data platform will link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies,\" an official for the department told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",

      "News of the HHS reversal contradicting Bhattacharya was first reported by STAT News.",
      "The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases.",
      "The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry.",
      "Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\"",
      "According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\"",

    "summary": "The GOP is unlikely to reach its lofty goal in spending cuts without paring back Medicaid, the safety net that helps more than 70 million people.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans are facing the difficult task of slashing $1.5 trillion \u2014 with hundreds of billions likely in Medicaid spending \u2014 to help offset the cost of President Trump's tax cuts.",
      "House leadership has denied that Medicaid \u2014 a joint federal-state health insurance program that provides care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities \u2014 will be gutted. But it's unclear how Republicans plan to reach the level of spending cuts laid out in the budget resolution that Congress adopted earlier this month without drastically trimming the program.",
      "The resolution directs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, to find at least $880 billion in savings over 10 years as part of the package central to Mr. Trump's domestic agenda. Cuts to Medicare, which provides health coverage for seniors, are off the table, leaving Medicaid funding as the most likely way to reach that target.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently calculated that achieving those savings would not be possible without cuts to Medicaid, which accounts for 93% of non-Medicare mandatory spending under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Projected spending for programs other than Medicare and Medicaid totals $581 billion, meaning that even if the committee eliminated all other non-mandatory spending, which is highly unlikely, it would still come up short of the $880 billion goal.",
      "Republicans have vowed to protect benefits for eligible recipients, and some have suggested that overhauling the program could help them reach their target instead of cutting benefits.",
      "\"We're going to protect the benefits that everyone is legally entitled to, the beneficiaries who have a legal right to that, it will be preserved. Those are essential safety net programs that Republicans support. The president has made clear: Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid will not take a hit. So you can count on that,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said on April 10.",
      "Johnson argued that there's billions in waste, fraud and abuse and said Republicans are considering Medicaid work requirements.",
      "\"We can find well more than $800 billion in savings, and we will,\" Johnson pledged.",
      "Rep. Jodey Arrington of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, estimated at least $160 billion could be saved by kicking ineligible recipients off of Medicaid.",
      "But Joan Alker, the executive director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, said \"there's no way to achieve those savings without cutting health care for millions of seniors in nursing homes, children, parents, veterans, caregivers, people with cancer or disabilities.\"",
      "\"Nobody gets a Medicaid check in the mail, and there are already processes in place to go after bad actors like fake labs or unscrupulous providers filing false Medicaid claims,\" she said. \"Proposals to cut fraud would fund more prosecutors and investigators to ferret out criminal activity but that is not what Congress is doing \u2014 these are just proposals to cut Medicaid.\"",
      "Another proposal under consideration is moving more of the cost sharing to the states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Forty states have adopted the Medicaid expansion, and under that provision, the federal government pays 90% of the costs for expansion enrollees while the states are responsible for 10%. The federal government's portion for those covered through traditional Medicaid can range from 50% to 83%.",
      "Rep. Austin Scott, a Georgia Republican, said there are discussions about cutting the federal match for Medicaid expansion back to the traditional level.",
      "\"Nobody would be kicked off Medicaid as long as the governors decided that they wanted to continue to fund the program,\" Scott said in an interview with Fox Business on Monday. \"We are going to ask the states to pick up and pay some of the additional percentage.\"",
      "The federal government would save $626 billion over a decade if states assumed more of the expansion costs, according to a KFF analysis. If states are unable to shoulder the costs and eliminate the expansion, federal Medicaid spending would decrease by $1.7 trillion, the analysis found. The Medicaid expansion covers more than 20 million low-income adults, who would lose coverage if states are unable to pick up the expansion costs.",
      "Last week, a dozen House Republicans in battleground districts wrote a letter to leadership and Energy and Commerce Chairman Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican, that warned they would not support a final reconciliation bill that includes \"any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.\"",
      "\"Balancing the federal budget must not come at the expense of those who depend on these benefits for their health and economic security,\" they wrote. \"Cuts to Medicaid also threaten the viability of hospitals, nursing homes, and safety-net providers nationwide. Many hospitals\u2014particularly in rural and underserved areas\u2014rely heavily on Medicaid funding, with some receiving over half their revenue from the program alone. Providers in these areas are especially at risk of closure, with many unable to recover. When hospitals close, it affects all constituents, regardless of healthcare coverage.\"",
      "The issue will come to a head in the coming weeks. The Energy and Commerce Committee plans to mark up its portion of the reconciliation package on May 7.",

      "The Trump administration plans to ease some tariffs on automakers to ensure the companies aren't hit twice by its tariffs, which now apply a 25% import duty to car parts as well as 25% on steel and aluminum.",
      "President Trump will travel to Michigan, the home base for the U.S. automobile industry, to mark his first 100 days of his second term.",
      "\"President Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said. \"This deal will be a major victory for the president's trade policy by rewarding companies who are already manufacturing domestically, while providing a runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment in investing in America and expanding domestic manufacturing.\"",
      "The 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but automakers won't be subject to the additional 25% import duty on imported steel and aluminum. Reimbursements will also be given to automakers who have already paid the double tariffs, the administration said.",
      "John Elkann, chairman of Stellantis, whose brands include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram, praised the Trump administration's move to soften auto industry tariffs.",
      "\"Stellantis appreciates the tariff relief measures decided by President Trump,\" he said in a statement. \"While we further assess the impact of the tariff policies on our North American operations, we look forward to our continued collaboration with the U.S. Administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports.\"",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley expressed support for Mr. Trump's decision to cushion the auto industry from the impact of tariffs. Some vehicles could increase in price by\u00a0as much as $10,000\u00a0due to the tariffs, analysts say.",
      "\"Ford welcomes and appreciates these decisions by President Trump, which will help mitigate the impact of tariffs on automakers, suppliers and consumers,\" Farley said in a statement. \"We will continue to work closely with the administration in support of the president's vision for a healthy and growing auto industry in America.

      "Tariffs still rattling car makers",
      "Meanwhile, General Motors on Tuesday postponed its first-quarter conference call to discuss its guidance and quarterly results from April 29 to May 1, so that it can assess potential tariff changes. GM posted strong financial results for its first quarter Tuesday, but said it will reassess its expectations for 2025 due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"We believe the future impacts of tariffs could be significant, so we are reassessing our guidance and look forward to sharing more when we have greater clarity,\" GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said during a media call Tuesday, according to CNBC. \"The prior guidance can't be relied upon, and we'll come back to the market with clarity as soon as we have it.\"",

    "story": [
      "UPS on Tuesday announced it is planning to cut 20,000 jobs this year, part of a cost-cutting effort that's linked to the delivery giant's decision to deliver fewer packages from Amazon, its biggest customer.",
      "The shipping company, which operates in over 200 countries, currently has around 490,000 employees. The layoffs will impact slightly over 4% of its workforce. This follows an announcement from UPS last year that it would cut 12,000 positions.",
      "The move is part of the company's plan to consolidate UPS's facilities and workforce. Along with the job cuts, the company announced it will also close 73 of its buildings by the end of June 2025 and said that it may target additional buildings for closure.",
      "\"These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability,\" Brian Dykes, the chief financial officer of UPS said during an earnings call on Tuesday morning.",
      "In a Tuesday regulatory filing, UPS said the cuts are in \"connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.\" The company, which announced $21.5 billion in revenue for this past quarter, expects to save $3.5 billion this year as a result of its consolidation plan.",
      "According to Sean M. O'Brien, the Teamsters general president, UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 Teamsters jobs under their current national master agreement.",
      "\"If UPS wants to continue to downsize corporate management, the Teamsters won't stand in its way,\" O'Brien said. \"But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.\"",
      "\"Strong\" relationship with Amazon",
      "The company in January\u00a0said it had reached an agreement with Amazon to decrease its delivery volume by more than 50% in the second half of 2026.",
      "\"The reduction of package volume from Amazon is something UPS chose to do as we focus on revenue quality, and increase domestic operating margin and profitability,\" a UPS spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "Amazon said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the company has a \"strong working relationship\" with UPS and that it had actually offered to increase UPS' volumes before the delivery company made the decision to reduce its Amazon shipments.",
      "\"Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision,\" said Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson. \"We'll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\"",
      "UPS delivers millions of packages worldwide each year. Last year, the company delivered an average of 22.4 million parcels per day, or 5.7 billion for the entire year.",
      "UPS shares slipped 55 cents, or 0.6%, to $96.61 in afternoon trading.",
      "Trade risks rising",
      "In its\u00a0quarterly earnings statement, the company also mentioned the risk that shifts in global trade policy could have on business. The Trump administration has introduced sweeping new tariffs in recent months that have already began to impact the flow of goods in and out of the country, and around the world.",
      "UPS handles roughly 400,000 imported parcels each day, or roughly 2% of the packages they move on a daily basis. Still, the company could be impacted if the trade war between China and the U.S. continues.",
      "\"From a revenue perspective, last year, revenue on our China to U.S. trade lanes represented 11% of our total international revenue,\" said CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said during Tuesday's earning call. \"Our China to U.S. trade lines are our most profitable trade lines.\"",
      "UPS is keeping customers abreast of tariff developments on its\u00a0website. It has also introduced a\u00a0tool\u00a0called UPS Global Checkout that shows online shoppers the upfront costs they will have to pay in duties, fees and taxes.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:59:43 -0400",
    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "GasBuddy, a company that tracks prices at more than 150,000 gas stations across the country, told CBS News it had not found evidence of a gas station selling gas for $1.98 per gallon in April.",
      "Patrick De Haan, who leads petroleum analysis with the company, said the lowest price they could find in April was $2.19 at a gas station in Texas.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim that gas prices are at their lowest level since his first term is also not true; gas prices were lower than they are now for the first six months of Biden's presidency.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for more information on the president's claim.",
      "Trump's partially true claim that crude oil prices have dropped significantly since he took office",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"Energy is down and we're about $64 a barrel. When I came in\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and we were looking at $89, $90, $95.\"",
      "The president also claimed crude oil prices dropped to about $64 a barrel, from around $89 when he took office.",
      "A White House spokesman said the president was referring to the price per barrel of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark. According to data from FactSet, Mr. Trump accurately described the current price of Brent crude, which was about $64 a barrel on April 28, but he also exaggerated the price at the time he assumed office, which was about $80. The White House did not explain the discrepancy.",
      "According to a recent Energy Information Administration report, Mr. Trump's tariff hikes in early April contributed to declines in oil prices as traders weighed the potential impact on global demand. An early April announcement that OPEC members\u00a0would increase oil production ahead of schedule also added to the downward pressure on prices.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that the price of groceries came down since he took office",
      "Trump said April 24: \"Groceries are down.\" Trump said April 17: \"Food is down. Groceries, as we call it, are down.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that grocery prices have declined since he took office. However, Consumer Price Index data shows average cost of groceries in March increased by 0.49% from the previous month and by 2.4% compared to the previous year.",
      "Prices vary across products, and the White House said the president was referring to declines in the consumer prices of certain grocery store items like fresh vegetables. The USDA's Food Price Outlook shows that fresh vegetable prices decreased 1.1% in March, after falling by 1.7% in February. However, the same report also shows the prices of beef, poultry, eggs, and nonalcoholic beverages all ticked up in March.",
      "These increases occurred before the president imposed a baseline 10% tariff on goods from most countries in early April as well as tariffs as high as 145% on imports from China. Economists expect the prices of some grocery store items, including coffee and chocolate, will rise as a result, which could be reflected when data for April is released in the coming weeks.",
      "Trump's false claim that egg prices have gone down 87%",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House, thousands and thousands of eggs, and the price was down 87% so we did a great job.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that egg prices are down significantly, without clarifying whether he is referring to wholesale or consumer prices. The president has a point that wholesale prices have declined since he took office, but he overstates the size of the decline. And recent data suggests consumer prices remain elevated.",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 what large buyers such as Costco or Walmart pay producers \u2014 have dropped sharply since mid-March as egg losses due to bird flu decreased last month. U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows wholesale egg prices were roughly 52% lower on April 25 than they were at the start of Mr. Trump's second term. The White House did not explain the discrepancy in the president's figures.",
      "Meanwhile, retail prices for consumers remain at record highs. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released on April 10 shows average retail egg prices hit $6.23 per dozen in March, surpassing the previous record $5.90 set in February.",
      "A March 28 report from the Department of Agriculture said it can take \"up to three weeks\" for consumers to benefit from the wholesale price decline. If retail prices show consistent decline, this should be reflected in the national average from BLS for April, said Jeremy Horpedahl, an associate professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas. That data should become available on May 13.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:55:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Despite President Trump's promise of cuts, the federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days than the same time period last year.",
    "story": [
      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories. Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "But even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent about $220 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",
      "Musk recently said his work with DOGE is winding down.",
      "Explore the spending details yourself",
      "You can explore the government's daily account ledgers for yourself. We've isolated the money spent by category in the first few months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period in each of the last 10 years.",
      "You can search for agencies or spending categories below to see the change over time and how much or less is being spent during this first 100 days of the Trump administration. We've limited the table to agencies and categories with at least $100 million in spending since Jan. 20, 2025.",

      "At the Port of Los Angeles, which, along with the Port of Long Beach, receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia, shipments last week were down 10% compared with the same period one year earlier. That number is expected to keep falling.",
      "\"We are now beginning to see the flow of cargo to the Port of Los Angeles slow,\" Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka said at a Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners meeting on April 24. \"It's my prediction that in two weeks time, arrivals will drop by 35%,\" he added.",
      "U.S. retailers had rushed to import goods into the country ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariffs going into effect, leading to a spike in imports since last summer. Now, with the 145% tariffs making goods from China roughly two-and-a-half times more expensive than they were last year, \"essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,\" Seroka said.",
      "By another estimate, container bookings from China to the U.S. are down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company.",

      "Empty shelves?",

A widespread booking freeze, as shippers paused mid-shipment cycle to reassess costs, timelines and broader trade strategy,\" Vizion said in a report.",
      "Freightos, a freight booking platform, notes that carriers are canceling sailings from China at a fast clip, because they can't fill their ships with goods. Ocean container prices have dropped from $8,100 in July 2024 for a standard 40-foot container, to roughly, $2,327, the group noted.",
      "Many importers are pausing shipments until they gain more clarity into Mr. Trump's tariff plans. A Freightos survey of 195 small importers found that 33% of businesses planned to pause shipments in response to the tariffs.",
      "Kristin Bear, owner of a U.S.-based lingerie company, Kilo Brava, is hoping Mr. Trump softens his stance on tariffs, so that she can continue to manufacture garments in China and import them to the U.S. She can't afford to import goods with 145% tariffs in place, and if they don't come down, \"we'll just have to abandon the goods and close the company,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Early in his second term, President Trump is struggling to deliver on his campaign trail promises to invigorate the U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "During his campaign last year, President Trump repeatedly attacked former President Joe Biden for his handling of the economy, vowing to boost economic growth and\u00a0lower inflation. But 100 days into his second term in the White House, the president is struggling to deliver on those promises.",
      "Mr. Trump's signature policies on trade, immigration and government spending have not only failed to spark economic growth \u2014 they're contributing to a sharp contraction in activity and threaten to re-ignite inflation, data shows. Economists also\u00a0warn that the chances of a U.S. recession\u00a0are rising.",
      "For millions of employers around the country, the Trump administration's helter-skelter approach to imposing tariffs on key trading partners, along with just about every other country on the planet,\u00a0has been challenging, corporate executives and small business owners have told CBS News.",
      "\"I can't think of a precedent for anything like this,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch of the impact of Mr. Trump's first 100 days on the economy.",
      "\"President Reagan, for instance, implemented a lot of changes in terms of tax policy and defense spending and cuts, and those things had big impacts,\" she added, \"but the element here that's quite different is the approach, which has been quite inconsistent and chaotic.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's loyal base of supporters continues to voice support, among other voters there's also a widespread and growing belief that the administration is too focused on\u00a0tariffs\u00a0and not focused enough on lowering prices, according to CBS News polling about the president's first 100 days in office.",
      "Such concerns come as the White House makes a sharp break with the country's traditional playbook on global trade. The result, say critics, includes the highest tariffs in more than a century; sudden, confusing\u00a0shifts in tariff policy\u00a0and major damage to the U.S.' geopolitical relationships.",
      "\"Tariffs have been an unmitigated disaster, economically,\" former Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican and erstwhile economics professor at Texas A&M University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There's no doubt about it that the tariff policy in and of itself will drive up prices because tariffs are a tax. And remember, 61% of imports are component parts to be used in the production of goods and services in America.\"",
      "Gramm added, \"I want to emphasize that the harm of tariffs isn't just inflation \u2014 it's what they do for efficiency and economic growth.\"",
      "The Trump administration stands by its economic record to date, with White House spokesman Kush Deai saying in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that \"President Trump's America First policies are delivering much-needed economic relief for everyday Americans while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness.\"",
      "\"Within 100 days of President Trump's second term in office, Americans saw the first monthly price drop in years in the March inflation report, while industry leaders ranging from Apple to Hyundai to Nvidia have made trillions in historic investment commitments to reshore manufacturing back to the United States,\" Desai added. \"President Trump delivered a historic economy in his first term, and he's running back the success in his second term.\"",
      "Economic slowdown",
      "Already, the U.S. economy is showing signs of slowing. Business surveys in April suggest the U.S. is headed for \"a sluggish pace of growth,\" according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, which pointed to what it calls an \"an existential crisis\" for businesses, created by Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The country's gross domestic product \u2014 the total annual value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S. \u2014 is forecast to slow to 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, a sharp decline from 2.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, according to economists polled by financial services firm FactSet. For the year, economic growth is predicted to slow to 1.9%, versus 2.8% in 2024, FactSet data shows.",
      "Economists warn that the U.S. could slip into a recession due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists largely gave the U.S. economy a good rating, pointing to its strong growth, low unemployment and progress in bringing inflation under control.",
      "Businesses large and small say the tariffs will cause disruptions, with almost 900 companies in the last 30 days alone citing the barrage of new U.S. levies in their earnings calls. That compares with 100 mentions in December 2024, according to transcripts posted by FactSet. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Walmart and Target\u00a0privately warned Mr. Trump that the tariffs could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves within weeks.",
      "\"Most businesses plan to pass these costs on to their consumers, which will make things more expensive, and we're going to see cuts in consumer spending as a result,\" Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics said, adding that her firm isn't forecasting a recession although it has pared its GDP outlook. \"That's less revenue for businesses.\"",
      "Inflation fears flare",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" vowing that if he would bring down prices \"very quickly\" in a second term.",
      "But 100 days into his new administration, consumers are skeptical about Mr. Trump's vow to tackle inflation, with 63% telling CBS News in new polling that they believed his policies would cause grocery prices to go up. Only 15% said they believe his administration will help lower their grocery bills.",
      "Consumers are clearly worried about tariffs, with the same CBS News poll finding that 55% of respondents said Mr. Trump doesn't have a clear plan for tariffs and trade. Americans now expect inflation to rise to 6.5% a year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index \u2014 a potentially self-fulling outlook that could cause consumers to pull back on spending.",
      "So far, however, inflation data shows that price increases eased to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February. Falling gas prices have come as a relief for motorists, with the national average for a gallon of regular gas now at $3.17, compared with $3.66 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "Still, many economists forecasts that inflation will pick up later this year as the impact of tariffs works its way through the economy.",
      "The case for tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that his tariff policies will benefit the U.S. economy over the long term. In his view, the cost of the tariffs will spur both U.S. and foreign businesses to expand in the U.S., spawning jobs for American workers and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, some businesses have said they are investing in domestic manufacturing, with Apple planning a $500 billion expansion of its U.S. facilities over four years and IBM on Monday announcing a $150 billion investment to \"fuel the economy.\"",
      "The president also maintains that tariffs will bring in trillions in new federal revenue , helping to offset an extension of his 2017 tax cuts currently being hammered out by Republican lawmakers. But many economists are skeptical that his tariffs could bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods\u00a0when their prices rise.",
      "\"Consumers have to be confident to affect their spending,\" noted Donald Boudreaux, an economist at George Mason University (whose book with Sen. Gramm, \"The Triumph of Economic Freedom: Debunking the Seven Great Myths of American Capitalism,\" will be published next month). \"The current policy is reducing their confidence.\"",
      "For his part, Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the impact of U.S. tariffs will cause \"some pain\" for Americans, while adding in a February social media post that \"IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\"",
      "Market turmoil",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the Trump administration's economic policies has been clear: The S&P 500 index has lost 10% of its value since reaching a post-inauguration high on February 19, putting the broad-based market into correction territory.",
      "The dollar has lost about 9% of its value since Mr. Trump's inauguration, according to the U.S. dollar index, which compares the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies. Typically, investors rush to the bond market in times of economic uncertainty, but in recent weeks\u00a0bond prices have slid and yields have risen \u2014\u00a0 signs investors are rattled by the impact of Trump administration policies.",
      "\"I would emphasize that this movement in the asset markets is indeed unusual, and it happened particularly after April 2, 'Liberation Day',\" or the day when Mr. Trump announced tariffs on almost every nation on Earth, Boudreaux said. \"It can only be explained by global investor fears of what might happen in the U.S. economy.\"",
      "He added, \"It's too soon to tell how far those fears will go, but the early signs aren't cheery.\"",
      "A boost from tax cuts and deregulation?",
      "To be sure, mounting anxieties among consumers, businesses and investors don't by themselves herald an inevitable economic downturn. And so far, the economy remains resilient, with unemployment near a 50-year low and inflation edging down to 2.4% in March.",
      "Some economists also point to what they view as positives in Mr. Trump's agenda, such as prospects for tax cuts and deregulation, which could spur economic growth. And Mr. Trump has touted his administration's efforts to slash federal spending, overseen by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as a win for taxpayers.",
      "\"We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Mr. Trump told Time Magazine in an interview this month.",
      "DOGE, by its account, has cut about $160 billion in costs, or about 2.4% of the federal government's roughly $6.8 trillion in annual spending. But some critics have pointed out that the cuts will ultimately cost taxpayers\u00a0due to rehiring federal workers who were mistakenly fired, lower productivity of remaining workers and through lower tax collections from the IRS, which is reducing its staffing under DOGE's direction.",
      "In the meantime, some observers say the biggest hurdle to Mr. Trump's economic goals is of his own creation.",
      "\"We want Trump to succeed \u2014 in criticizing this trading policy, it's the policy we're criticizing,\" Sen. Gramm said. \"I don't believe the president can achieve what he wants to achieve for America unless his trade policy changes.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 28 Apr 2025 17:26:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Although attending college still offers a payoff, a recent study by New York Fed economists suggests it might not make financial sense for some people.",
    "story": [
      "Getting a college education has traditionally been seen as a way to move up the economic ladder. But an analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the cost of a degree may not always be worth it.",
      "The value of a college education has increasingly come into question in recent years, especially as tuition costs steadily climb and millions of Americans grapple with student loans. As a result, only one in four U.S. adults say it's extremely or very important to have a four-year college degree to get a well-paying job, according to a 2024\u00a0Pew Research poll.",
      "To be sure, the case for attending college remains strong. Another study by the New York Fed\u00a0found\u00a0that in recent years the typical college graduate with a bachelor's degree had annual income of roughly $80,000, versus $47,000 for people with only a high school diploma \u2014a 68% premium.",
      "Yet a recent study by the Fed bank suggests a college degree hasn't paid off for at least 25% of college graduates in recent decades.",
      "Of course, not everyone goes to college chiefly to earn a high income \u2014 education can be its own reward, after all. But how you\u00a0 navigate your college career \u2014 or whether you choose to attend at all \u2014 is among the most important financial decisions a person will make.",
      "Here's when a diploma may not deliver much of a bang for the buck.",
      "When might a college degree not be worth it?",
      "Not surprisingly, the more a student must spend on out-of-pocket expenses, the lower their typical return on investment. The average college student pays about $30,000 out of pocket for four years of college, according to the New York Fed study. However, students could face significantly higher costs if they choose to live on campus, or if they miss out on financial aid and are forced to pay a school's full price.",
      "The typical college graduate sees a return on investment (ROI) of roughly 12.5% according to the New York Fed. That rate has remained mostly unchanged over the past three decades, and still exceeds the returns on most other investments, including the stock market, which over time offers long-term return of about 8%.",
      "Despite that payoff, certain factors can lower a college grad's ROI. For example, the researchers found that living on campus increased the price tag for college by nearly $30,000 \u2013 from $180,000 to $207,000 \u2013 reducing the return on investment to about 11%. The 1.5% drop in ROI may seem nominal, but it can translate to hundreds of thousands in lost dollars.",
      "\"This extra cost and the associated return are comparable to attending a more expensive school that is roughly twice the average price,\" the researchers, economists\u00a0Jaison Abel and\u00a0Richard Deitz, said in the study.",
      "Among college graduates, 25% actually see little return on investment. This group was making less than $10,000 more in income than the median high school graduate in 2024. Their rate of return was only 2.6% compared to the average of 12.5% \u2014 meaning they see much less of a payoff.",
      "Another factor that can reduce the value of a college degree is how long it takes to obtain. The typical bachelor's program runs for four years, but in some cases students might extend the timeline if they haven't completed their course load. That can have major financial implications.",
      "Taking an extra one to two years to get your degree adds \"considerably to the cost,\" the New York Fed\u00a0found. There's the direct cost students have to pay for the additional tuition, but also higher \"opportunity costs\" \u2014 for example, a student who starts their career later misses out on years of working experience and can end up earning less over their lifetime.",
      "\"All in all, we estimate that taking five years to complete college pushes the median rate of return down to about 9% and taking six years pushes it down to 7%,\" the researchers found.",
      "Graduating in five years, rather than four, pushes up the total cost of college from $180,000 to $272,000, while taking six years would cost $364,000.",
      "How much does a student's major matter?",
      "Another important consideration in deciding if going to college is a sound investment is a student's major. After all, certain fields tend to lead to higher incomes.",
      "So-called STEM majors tend to earn the most, both in the early and mid-stages off their career, according to New York Fed\u00a0data. For instance, a computer engineering major stands to make a median wage of $122,000 mid-career, versus $55,000 for an education major, according to the bank's data.",
      "Among the fields of study with the highest returns are engineering, business and health sciences. The return is lowest for those majoring in fine arts, liberal arts, leisure, and hospitality and education, which ranked last.",
      "\"While some of it may come down to choices people make for the jobs they wish to have, one significant consideration is college major, something over which students have direct control,\" Abel and Dietz wrote.",

A majority say tariffs will drive up prices and end up costing more money than they generate, according to a new Gallup poll conducted April 2 to April 15.",

    "summary": "The push by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal funding will cost taxpayers money, nonpartisan group finds. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says it has saved $160 billion through its push to root out wasteful or fraudulent government spending. But that effort may also have come at a cost for taxpayers, with a new estimate from a nonpartisan research and advocacy group estimating that DOGE's actions will cost $135 billion this fiscal year.",
      "The analysis seeks to tally the costs associated with putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity, according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce.",
      "PSP's estimate is based on the $270 billion in annual compensation costs for the federal workforce, calculating the impact of DOGE's actions, from paid leave to productivity hits. The $135 billion cost to taxpayers doesn't include the expense of defending multiple lawsuits challenging DOGE's actions, nor the impact of estimated lost tax collections due to staff cuts at the IRS.",
      "DOGE has sought to slash federal spending by urging government workers to accept a deferred resignation plan, which allowed many employees to retain full pay and benefits through September without working. Another 24,000 government employees who were fired as part of the reform effort have since been\u00a0rehired after a court ruling.",
      "Other agencies also have rehired some workers after mistakenly firing them, such as bird flu experts\u00a0who were dismissed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal workers have also had to take on tasks such as documenting their weekly accomplishments, which has lowered productivity, Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We haven't seen much focus on the waste [DOGE] is creating,\" Stier told CBS MoneyWatch about his group's decision to analyze the costs of DOGE's cuts. \"This is an effort that was created to address waste, but we were seeing the opposite.\"",
      "\"Ultimately it's the public that will end up paying for this,\" he added, noting that he expects the taxpayers costs to grow after other DOGE cuts take effect.",
      "The White House took issue with the analysis.",
      "\"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \"The American public are in lockstep with the president's mission and will not be swayed by more lies coming from the legacy media.\"",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE's efforts aren't winning over most voters, with a new\u00a0Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll finding that 57% of Americans disapprove of the way Musk is handling his job in the Trump administration. About 6 in 10 said they're worried President Trump will do too much to cut the size and role of the federal government, the poll found.",
      "Why job cuts could raise costs",
      "The IRS, which is planning on cutting roughly\u00a040% of its workforce, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "To be sure, the DOGE cuts could pay off over time, with a leaner, more focused federal workforce. For example, the direct savings from those layoffs will amount to $38 billion over 10 years, the Partnership for Public Service estimated.",
      "But Stier maintains that the costs for taxpayers could grow as they ripple through the economy, such as reductions in funding of health and science research. One analysis by researchers at institutions including the University of Maryland and University of Pennsylvania estimates that cuts to health research will result in a $16 billion annual economic loss, with 68,000 jobs lost.",
      "\"One can always imagine a miracle occurring, but none of this makes sense on so many different levels,\" Stier said.",
      "DOGE's \"wall of receipts\"",
      "DOGE keeps a running public tally of the federal money the task force says it has saved, posted on its\u00a0website in what is called a \"wall of receipts.\" But some of those savings have been overstated, a February CBS News investigation found.",
      "At the same time, DOGE's $160 billion in savings is far less than Musk's previously stated goal of shrinking annual government spending by $2 trillion, or almost one-third of the federal budget. Many experts say that far more ambitious objective is unlikely to be achieved without cutting major federal programs like Social Security and Medicare, which Mr. Trump has vowed not to touch.",
      "Musk said Tuesday that he'll curtail his work at DOGE starting in May. His decision comes as Tesla, the electric vehicle maker he runs, saw a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit and a 20% decline in vehicle sales as some consumers snubbed the brand due to objections to Musk's government work.",
      "Musk said he still plans to spend one to two days a week on DOGE-related work, focusing on eliminating government waste.",
      "\"I'll have to continue to keep doing it for the remainder of the president's term to make sure the waste and fraud doesn't come roaring back,\" he said during Tesla's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.",

      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",

      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

    "story": [
      "Is 100 days enough time to evaluate this president? His supporters generally don't think so, but others do \u2014 perhaps because most Americans think President Trump is already making major changes to how the government \u2014 and the U.S. economy \u2014 work.",
      "Those opening days, in public opinion terms, have been marked by Mr. Trump's continued support from a loyal base of supporters, but also a widespread and growing belief among others that the administration is focused too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices. That's weighing on his approval ratings on the economy and inflation, which have gone down.",
      "Alongside that, he continues to get majority approval for his deportation program, though more Americans prioritize the economy in their evaluations of him.",
      "MAGA Republicans, in contrast, say their evaluations are based more on immigration and overwhelmingly approve of his efforts there. Plus they have a much rosier outlook on the U.S. economy than Americans overall now that Trump is in office, and most of them say it is too soon to judge him.",
      "Others who voted for him, but who don't identify as MAGA, have become a little less approving of his handling of the economy and inflation in recent months. And since the start of his term, his approval rating has slid among some groups he made gains with in the 2024 election, including independents, young people, and Hispanic people.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump sees disapproval on the economy from those who think he's put too much focus on tariffs.",
      "And meanwhile, Democrats overwhelmingly disapprove of what they see from him, want their party to oppose him more and say they're \"frustrated\" with the Democratic Party's response so far. Mr. Trump's approval rating among people who sat out the '24 election started out higher, too.",
      "Those perceived changes elicit different judgments, though. Republicans say they are for the better, and Democrats, the worse. Asked how Trump's presidency so far has made them feel, most Republicans say they're satisfied, while Democrats and independents say they're frustrated and nervous.",
      "Measuring a president at 100 days is something of a contrivance that is based on a marker set during Franklin Delano Roosevelt's first term back in the 1930s. Then again, many presidents come in promising a lot of action quickly. Most Americans do think they can judge this administration in that time frame. Mr. Trump's 2024 voters, and most of his current approvers, are less likely to think it's enough time, whereas his disapprovers think it's enough.",
      "Tariffs, promises and prices",
      "Mr. Trump's voters widely believe he's doing what he promised in the campaign. Most of the public agrees \u2014 whether or not they like what he's doing \u2014 though the percentage is down from the early weeks of his term.",
      "People who think Mr. Trump is putting too much focus on tariffs are more likely to say he's doing different things from what he promised.",
      "Here's how differences on economics play out:",
      "MAGA Republicans stand apart in their outlook for the U.S. economy. While most Americans say it is getting worse, MAGA Republicans say it is getting better. They also rate the current economy much better than others do. So, while evaluations of the economy remain mostly bad, Republicans' views have pushed the overall ratings up a bit, with an even larger partisan gap now.",
      "Overall, more Americans continue to say Trump's policies are making them financially worse off than better off. Expectations at the start of his term were different \u2014 more expected his policies to improve their finances.",
      "Two-thirds of those who think they're being made worse off say he isn't doing what he promised.",
      "And that has led to declining approval of his handling of the economy and inflation, specifically. Both ratings are now their lowest levels of the term so far. His rating on inflation is driven very much by the impact of his policies people see on prices.",
      "Support for tariffs has been declining, as a rising number of Americans feel the administration is focusing too much on the issue. And over recent weeks, fewer now believe Mr. Trump has a clear plan for tariffs and trade.",
      "When asked to pick what issue is most important to them in judging the Trump administration, the economy and immigration top the list. Those judging Mr. Trump on immigration heavily approve of his overall job performance, while those judging him on the economy disapprove in large numbers.",
      "Mr. Trump's overall approval rating is down from the high at the start of this term.",
      "Immigration and deportation",
      "Most Americans think Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings. Most also continue to approve of his deportation program in general.",
      "Meanwhile, three-quarters say it isn't acceptable if some legal residents are detained by mistake as part of that program. A large 8 in 10 say it wouldn't be acceptable if some legal residents are deported to foreign countries.",
      "And most who don't think these things would be acceptable disapprove of his overall handling of immigration.",
      "(On this, MAGA Republicans do stand differently from others, coming in about twice as likely as Americans overall to say legal residents being detained would be acceptable.)",
      "It may be that the perceived implementation of the deportation plan is affecting larger views of how Mr. Trump is handling immigration, even as a majority approve of the deportation program in general. On balance, his handling of immigration, generally, is lower than it was earlier in term. Independents, especially those with college degrees, have become less approving over time.",
      "Most Americans also think Mr. Trump is trying to expand the powers of the presidency \u2014 a view driven heavily by Democrats and those who disapprove of his job performance. And those who think he is are more likely to feel democracy and rule of law in the U.S. is threatened.",
      "Most Americans do support limits to Mr. Trump's powers as president, though. A majority think he should get his policies enacted by working with Congress to pass legislation rather than through executive orders, and majorities of Democrats, Republicans and independents alike feel Mr. Trump should follow a Supreme Court ruling if it goes against his administration. Republicans also say their party in Congress should push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree with him.",

      "Senator Ed Markey, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said in a letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) on Friday that smaller enterprises deserve exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs, which the Massachusetts Democrat criticized as \"recklessly imposed.\"",
      "Markey also noted that the Trump administration has moved to shield corporate giants such as Apple and Google from the impact of some its trade policies, and he pressed the White House to protect small businesses. The U.S. earlier this month moved to exempt smartphones, computers and other high-tech products from the new tariffs, a boon to major tech manufacturers.",
      "\"Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, but because they operate on razor-thin margins, they are uniquely vulnerable to rising costs caused by the Trump Tariffs. These businesses simply do not have the financial cushion to absorb price shocks or the resources to navigate sudden changes to an already complex supply channel,\" Markey wrote.",
      "Under President Trump, the U.S. has hiked tariffs on Chinese imports to as much as 145%, while products from most other countries are subject to 10% tariffs. Mr. Trump also announced steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of U.S. trading partners, but earlier this month\u00a0paused them for 90 days.",

    "story": [
      "American consumers are starting to feel the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, especially online.",
      "Since the second week in April, sellers on Amazon have raised their prices on nearly 1,000 products, according to data from SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike \u2014 nearly 30%, according to the company's analysis.",
      "Costs rose on a wide range of items, from tech accessories such as phone chargers to women's clothing, SmartScout founder and CEO Scott Needham told CBS MoneyWatch. Anker, a top-selling brand on Amazon that sells mobile charging devices, has increased prices on roughly 25% of its products on the site, for example.",
      "\"It's one of first concerted efforts I've seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,\" Needham said.",
      "Tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told CNBC\u00a0earlier this month that he expected U.S. tariffs to boost prices on a host of consumer goods.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with levies of 125% on U.S. goods entering the country. Mr. Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices, saying that tariffs will reinvigorate the domestic manufacturing sector and spur economic growth.",
      "Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"Amazon consistently offers the lowest prices across the widest selection. We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Shein, Temu prices also rising",
      "Other major e-commerce players and retailers have also lifted prices to offset higher import costs, sometime by adding \"tariff surcharges\" to customers' bills. Chinese e-commerce sites Shein and Temu each announced\u00a0last week that they would hike prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that had allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "Those price hikes took effect today. On Temu's site, a pair of running sneakers that last week cost $14 now runs about $27.",
      "The jump illustrates retailers' struggles to navigate President Trump's tariff agenda. Sky-high tariffs can make manufacturing goods in countries like China uneconomical. But revamping supply chains or moving manufacturing to another country can take years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions dollars, experts say.",
      "Uncertainty over tariff rates and how long such levies could remain in place is also making it difficult for companies to plan.",
      "Mr. Trump said this week that the U.S. and China were actively negotiating over how to resolve their trade differences and that he expected tariffs on Chinese imports to fall \"substantially.\" But officials in Beijing quickly\u00a0denied the sides were in talks, and instead reiterated its demand that the U.S. revoke its tariffs against the nation.",

    "summary": "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg says his tariff costs will surge more than 40-fold to $100 million, while sales could fall.",
    "story": [
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg thinks the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs will be catastrophic for both his family-owned toy business and for the broader U.S. economy. That's why he's suing President Trump.",
      "Woldenberg's business has 500 employees and sells thousands of learning-based toys like Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog and the Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register. Its lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., accuses Mr. Trump and other members of his administration of overreaching the president's authority in imposing the broad-based import duties. Congress has historically held the power to authorize new tariffs or make trade deals with other nations.",
      "With the administration's higher tariffs in place, the math is dire for Learning Resources, Woldenberg said. The company's import duties are set to increase from $2.3 million prior to the Trump administration to $100 million \u2014 a roughly 4,000% increase, he said.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic\"",
      "At the same time, Woldenberg said he expects his company's sales to drop 25% this year as consumers scale back spending due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's trade war, the CEO had forecast an 8% increase in sales. Economists on Wall Street\u00a0say the tariffs\u00a0will slow U.S. economic growth while boosting inflation.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic,\" Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Forces have been unleashed in the economy \u2014 the world economy as well as the U.S. economy \u2014 that will have consequences that will be irreparable.\"",
      "Learning Resources' suit asks the court to find that Mr. Trump's tariffs are unlawful and to block the administration from collecting the levies. Based in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Learning Resources is a private, family-owned business founded in 1984.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the suit or the company's financial challenges caused by the tariffs.",
      "For now, Woldenberg said he's focused on figuring out how to shift manufacturing out of China, where about 60% of his products are produced. Goods imported from that nation are now facing U.S. tariffs of 145%.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by the companies that import the products, Woldenberg's business \u2014 not China \u2014 is on the hook for paying for Mr. Trump's high import duties.",
      "One question facing Woldenberg is whether he can shift production out of China fast enough to keep ahead of Mr. Trump's tariffs. In recent years, Learning Resources has added factories in India and Vietnam, but that effort has only moved the needle so far, he said.",
      "\"In a two- or three-year period we moved 16% of our product from China to those markets and got things going,\" Woldenberg said. \"That took a lot of effort, cost us a couple million dollars, at least, in out-of-pocket expenses to move it from Point A to Point B, and a huge amount of man hours on our side to essentially redevelop all those products.\"",
      "Despite that effort, however, the company has to date moved only about 16% of its manufacturing capacity out of China to other countries, Woldenberg said.",
      "Reshoring realities",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that tariffs will revive the domestic manufacturing sector because the costs of the import taxes will spur both American and foreign businesses to reshore their factories to the U.S. But economists \u2014 and Woldenberg \u2014 are skeptical, pointing out that such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories.",
      "\"The fact that [Mr. Trump] believes in it is something that I think is irrelevant \u2014 there are people that believe in ghosts, OK?\" Woldenberg said.",
      "Learning Resources' financial resources aren't deep enough to build its own factory, Woldenberg said. He noted that he's also tried to find plants in the U.S. that could make some of his products because he believed toys with a \"Made in USA\" label could appeal to some customers.",
      "\"If we had six to 10 products that were made in America, we could go and say, 'Look! Made in America. You want made in America? Here's Made in America,\" he said. \"We can't even find somebody to make six or 10 products.\"",
      "The reason, he said, is U.S. manufacturers don't have the capability to make the types of products he's selling, while the costs of manufacturing them himself would be prohibitive. \"I cannot produce a factory that can produce our product at a competitive price,\" Woldenberg said.",
      "To be sure, some businesses have announced plans to build new U.S. plants or hire more workers in recent months. They include tech giant Apple, which in February\u00a0said\u00a0that it's committed to spending more than $500 billion on expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities over four years.",
      "But Apple \"is in a different stratosphere than me,\" Woldenberg noted. \"They also have like a dozen products. We have 2,000.\"",
      "Skittish workers",
      "Meantime, Woldenberg said he's committed to keeping his 500 workers employed, likening the current challenges to those his business faced during the pandemic. Now, as then, his employees are worried about the impact of Mr. Trump's trade war and whether their jobs might be at risk, he said.",
      "\"Two days before we were kicked out of our office in March of 2020, I had an all-company meeting and I said, 'We define this as a community problem ... the goal is to get everybody across the river.' And we did that,\" he said. \"No one lost an hour of pay.\"",
      "Woldenberg added, \"I have a very strong commitment to getting them through this, and it's unwavering, and I'll do everything that I can.\"",
      "Even so, Woldenberg wants to see the Trump administration drop their tariff plans.",
      "\"They should go back to the way things were on January 19th and figure out another plan. This one is not working,\" he said.",

      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I still think it's morally questionable to run these charters for the federal government and think it poses a very real reputational risk for Avelo,\" Miller said, citing protests against the airline at some of Avelo's hubs.",

    "summary": "Elon Musk and DOGE amassed vast power in President Trump's administration \u2014 reshaping federal agencies and spearheading deep cuts to the federal workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Since President Trump returned to office 100 days ago, Elon Musk has amassed vast power \u2014 leading the administration's efforts to shutter government agencies and slash the federal workforce.",
      "Musk's ruthless approach to leading the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 epitomized by a speech in which the Tesla CEO brandished a chainsaw \u2014 has drawn lawsuits, pushback from federal workers and criticism from Tesla investors. But he's also held onto broad support from Republican voters and, at least publicly, from Mr. Trump himself.",
      "Musk gained influence \u2014 and spent heavily \u2014 in 2024 race",
      "Musk \u2014 the world's richest person \u2014 endorsed Mr. Trump minutes after the then-presidential candidate's July 2024 assassination attempt. Musk had oscillated on backing Mr. Trump: The one-time Obama backer suggested Mr. Trump \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset\" in 2022, and later supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's 2024 GOP primary bid.",
      "The alliance between the two billionaires was defined by campaign cash. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Mr. Trump and other GOP candidates in 2024, much of it through Musk's America PAC. The group helped lead Mr. Trump's get-out-the-vote efforts, and became known for using its massive war chest in unorthodox and often controversial ways. One plan to dole out $1 million a day to swing state voters who signed a petition drew a lawsuit from Philadelphia's district attorney, who accused Musk's super PAC of running an illegal lottery.",
      "Mr. Trump floated a Musk-led \"government efficiency commission\" during the later months of the campaign. The scope of Musk's role was initially unclear: In a post-election statement, Mr. Trump framed DOGE as an external body that would offer \"advice and guidance,\" a far more limited role than the one Musk took on.",
      "Musk promises $2 trillion in cuts but slashes far less",
      "In an October campaign rally, the billionaire predicted he could find at least $2 trillion in annual savings, which would require him to slash the budget by nearly 30% \u2014 a daunting goal considering that almost half of all government spending goes toward the military, Medicare and Social Security, three politically difficult-to-cut areas. Earlier this year, Musk cited a still-ambitious $1 trillion as his target.",
      "So far, DOGE's stated cost savings haven't come close to the trillion-dollar mark. Musk said earlier this month he anticipates $150 billion in savings in the 2026 fiscal year by cutting waste and fraud. Meanwhile, the DOGE website says it has saved $160 billion through a combination of cancelling contracts and grants, selling assets and ferreting out fraud.",
      "But many of the cost savings touted by DOGE have been called into question. DOGE keeps a running tally of spending cuts on its website, but this \"wall of receipts\" has included errors and unverified claims, including an $8 million cancelled contract that was erroneously listed at $8 billion, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "White House spokesman Harrison Fields defended DOGE's cost-cutting goals and called $1 trillion a year an achievable benchmark. He also said mistakes are rare and \"corrected immediately,\" and the statistics on DOGE's site go through a \"lengthy assessment and analysis.\" The $8 billion mistake dates back to the prior administration, DOGE has argued.",
      "\"The goal is to cut as much waste, fraud and abuse from the federal government as possible,\" Fields told CBS News. \"The president is very happy and supportive of the achievements of DOGE, and knows that we are just now getting started.\"",
      "Some of Musk's claims about the size of the government's fraud problem are also difficult to prove. He told Fox Business' Larry Kudlow last month the government could save $500 billion to $700 billion by cutting fraud and waste from entitlement programs, but there's little evidence that fraud exists on anywhere near that scale, which would equal 20% to 30% of all annual spending on Social Security and Medicare. The Government Accountability Office estimates the government loses $233 billion to $521 billion per year due to fraud. When asked about Musk's $700 billion fraud estimates, Fields said \"I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility.\"",
      "And DOGE's efforts to slash the federal workforce could end up costing $135 billion due to paid leave and productivity costs, an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service estimates.",
      "That estimate was dismissed by the White House. \"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" Fields told CBS News last week.",
      "Thousands of federal workers cut since Trump and Musk's \"fork in the road\"",
      "When the Trump administration emailed millions of federal workers in January to offer months of pay in exchange for quitting their jobs, the message's subject line \u2014 \"Fork in the Road\" \u2014 was identical to the one Musk used to coax staff into leaving Twitter after he bought the site.",
      "Since then, Musk has played a central role in efforts to cut up to 10% of the civilian workforce.",
      "The White House says 75,000 people took the \"Fork in the Road\" deferred resignation deal, which offered to pay employees until the end of September if they resigned from their positions by early February. As many as 200,000 workers were expected to participate. Tens of thousands of federal employees have also been laid off, including large numbers of probationary workers with less than one or two years of service.",
      "The job cuts have hit across the federal government. DOGE staffers visited the Pentagon in February as the military plans to eliminate tens of thousands of civilian roles. The Social Security Administration has lost thousands of workers, and the Internal Revenue Service could cut its staff by 25% according to the Associated Press.",
      "Health agencies have been hit by the administration's cuts. The National Institutes of Health is expected to face steep budget cuts, a move former NIH Director Francis Collins warned could have dire consequences for public health in an interview with \"60 Minutes.\" The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has lost 10% of its staff, CBS News reported.",
      "Some 1,000 National Park Service workers were laid off, raising fears about understaffing.",
      "Fields told CBS News the Trump administration's job cuts are designed to avoid any disruption to critical government services, but added: \"To a bureaucracy that has gone untouched for decades, it's going to be disruptive.\"",
      "In some cases, laid-off probationary workers have been rehired due to now-paused court orders that halted the job cuts, causing confusion. \"We're supposed to be OK. But one minute we're in a good space, and the next minute we could just lose everything,\" one rehired Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services staff member told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, Musk has publicly blasted the federal workforce, claiming DOGE is on a mission to eliminate a \"dictatorship of the bureaucracy\" that's hostile to Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "In February, federal employees received an email with the subject line, \"What did you do last week?\" instructing them to reply with a list of five things they'd accomplished. Musk warned on X that any non-responses \"will be taken as a resignation.\" The move set off confusion, with some agencies telling workers not to respond. Musk later called the emails a \"pulse check\" designed to root out dead or nonexistent people that he claims are collecting paychecks.",
      "DOGE tries to shut down agencies: USAID, CFPB and more",
      "Even if DOGE's cuts could fall short of Musk's goals, its influence has been sweeping.",
      "Within days of Mr. Trump's inauguration, DOGE began touting cancelled contracts, and its staff became embedded in scores of departments. Musk told Fox Business last month his team of over 100 people was in \"pretty much\" every agency. Many of the funding cuts have been abrupt, and Musk has admitted DOGE has made mistakes in its rapid push to slash spending.",
      "In some cases, Musk's team has participated in the near-dismantling of federal agencies. The gambit has often begun with DOGE staffers accessing an agency's offices \u2014 in some cases clashing with employees \u2014 followed by mass job cuts.",
      "The U.S. Agency for International Development, a foreign aid agency that Musk described as a \"criminal organization\" awash with fraud, was one of his earliest targets. Two USAID security officials were put on leave for trying to stop DOGE staffers from accessing internal systems (a Trump administration spokesperson said at the time classified information wasn't accessed without security clearances). The Trump administration later placed many of USAID's staff on leave, halted foreign aid programs and began absorbing what remained of USAID into the State Department.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also drawn Musk's ire. In early February, DOGE personnel entered the financial regulator's office and \"camped out in the basement,\" a former agency staffer told CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" Hours later, Musk posted on X, \"CFPB RIP.\" The administration has tried to lay off 90% of CFPB staff and halt the agency's work, though a federal judge has temporarily blocked those moves.",
      "DOGE's efforts at the U.S. Institute of Peace triggered a legal standoff, with several fired board members suing the administration and accusing DOGE personnel of engaging in a \"literal trespass and takeover by force\" at the agency's headquarters. The White House defended cuts to the organization at the time, telling CBS News, \"Taxpayers don't want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-funded 'research institute' that has failed to deliver peace.\"",
      "Musk accesses federal data",
      "Personnel at DOGE gained access to the Treasury Department's internal payment system in the first few weeks of Mr. Trump's term, which Musk cast as a way to catch fraud. The move prompted concern from Democrats due to the sensitive personal data handled by the system and the possibility that DOGE could try to cut off spending authorized by Congress. The Trump administration said at the time Musk's team has \"read-only\" access.",
      "In mid-February, a staffer linked to DOGE also sought access to the Internal Revenue Service's taxpayer data system, drawing criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said the administration is planning a \"basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits.\"",
      "Musk has scrutinized the Social Security Administration, which he claims is rife with fraud, suggesting tens of millions of dead people are receiving payments and immigrants are abusing the system en masse, though he's never offered any evidence for either of these assertions. He's described Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme,\" though both Musk and Mr. Trump have said they would not cut benefits. At one point earlier this year, the SSA considered requiring Social Security recipients to verify their identities in person instead of over the phone, but the agency reversed course after seniors and their advocates objected.",
      "Musk clashes with Democrats, courts \u2014 and even Trump allies",
      "Musk's rise to power has drawn outrage from Democrats, who argue DOGE has unilaterally slashed spending appropriated by Congress. Most Republican lawmakers defended DOGE, though some have raised concerns about sweeping cuts to public health agencies and programs important to their districts.",
      "Public opinion on Musk is similarly divided. Some 52% of Americans said in late February Musk and DOGE had too much influence over federal worker firing decisions, including 81% of Democrats and 57% of independents but just 21% of Republicans, according to a CBS News poll with a margin of error of 2.5 points.",
      "Musk has occasionally clashed with other Trump loyalists. His pick for interim IRS leader \u2014 Hunter Biden whistleblower Gary Shapley \u2014 left the role after just 48 hours, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent privately complained to Mr. Trump. And Musk publicly feuded with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro over tariffs, calling him \"dumber than a sack of bricks.\"",
      "DOGE's aggressive moves have also drawn lawsuits arguing the agency has exceeded its authority. At various points, judges have halted DOGE's efforts to lay off workers and access the Treasury payment system, though in many cases, those rulings were stayed.",
      "Some legal challenges have zeroed in on Musk's official status in the administration. The White House says Musk is a \"special government employee,\" which allows him to serve for up to 130 days in a single yearlong period. The administration has argued in court papers that Musk isn't officially DOGE's administrator and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"",
      "DOGE clashes with Musk's business interests",
      "Musk's business empire benefits heavily from federal programs. Tesla sells billions of dollars a year in credits to automakers that fall short of federal emission rules, and its cars are subsidized by tax incentives for electric vehicles \u2014 though Mr. Trump has called for a rollback of electric car subsidies. Mr. Trump has also offered his public endorsement, promising to buy a Tesla in a White House event. Musk's aerospace company SpaceX has valuable contracts with NASA, and its satellite internet division Starlink could take over a contract to modernize the air traffic control system, the Associated Press reports.",
      "Musk has pushed back on conflict-of-interest concerns, saying in an Oval Office appearance with Mr. Trump, \"all of our actions are maximally transparent.\"",
      "But DOGE has caused agita for Tesla investors, some of whom fear Musk is too distracted to run the company or his polarizing image could hurt the carmaker's brand. The company's sales and profits have fallen over the past year, and its share price is down nearly 25% from early January, prompting some investors to urge him to step back from the Trump administration.",
      "Musk said on a Tesla earnings call last week his \"time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly\" in May. But he added that he'll remain involved for the rest of Mr. Trump's term.",
      "There's no indication DOGE or Musk's work at the White House will end next month. \"Elon Musk will still be a common face here,\" Fields said.",

    "summary": "California and nearly two dozen other states are suing the Trump administration over drastic cuts to the AmeriCorps agency.",
    "story": [
      "Two dozen states filed a lawsuit Tuesday over dramatic cuts to AmeriCorps, alleging the Trump administration is trying to \"dismantle\" the volunteer service organization as part of its sweeping federal cost-cutting campaign.",
      "AmeriCorps has put 85% of its staff on administrative leave ahead of planned job cuts, the lawsuit says. The agency has also allegedly slashed its National Civilian Community Corps, which sends volunteers to work on conservation, natural disaster response and other projects, and cut hundreds of millions in grants, covering 41% of the agency's budget.",
      "The lawsuit argues the cuts \u2014 which it links to President Trump's federal cost-cutting push, led by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 violate federal law and constitutional separation of powers, since Congress created and funded AmeriCorps.",
      "\"If the Defendants' actions are permitted to stand despite their statutory and constitutional defects, then the gutting of AmeriCorps will inflict immediate and irreparable harms on the Plaintiff States, their residents, and the public at large,\" reads the lawsuit, which was filed in Maryland federal court and led by California, Colorado, Delaware and Maryland.",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement: \"Americorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in improper payments in 2024 alone. President Trump has the legal right to restore accountability to the entire Executive Branch.\"",
      "AmeriCorps' inspector general said in November the agency \"has been unable to produce auditable financial statements for the last eight years,\" and recommended changes to the agency's financial practices.",
      "Founded in 1993, AmeriCorps oversees around 200,000 members, most of whom receive living stipends, and employs hundreds of people. It funds both directly operated programs, like the National Civilian Community Corps and grant-funded programs overseen by states.",
      "The AmeriCorps grants targeted to be eliminated by the Trump administration amount to nearly $400 million, hitting volunteer programs in all 50 states, according to the nonprofit America's Service Commissions.",
      "In a statement, America's Service Commissions said the cuts came late Friday with no advanced notice.",
      "\"Thousands of people who have steadfastly dedicated their lives to serving their country through AmeriCorps are finding their livelihoods suddenly thrown into jeopardy, and hundreds of communities are losing critical services they rely on,\" ASC CEO Kaira Esgate said.",
      "After the drastic cuts to grants were announced last week, every California service-based program with AmeriCorps was told to stop working.",
      "\"These actions by President Trump and Elon Musk not only threaten our funding \u2013 they vandalize our values. We're going to fight to stop them,\" California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement about the AmeriCorps cuts.",
      "California's AmeriCorps volunteers amassed a total of 4,397,674 of service hours during the 2023-24 year, according to the governor's office.",
      "Newsom noted that California has already been recruiting for its own California Service Corps program, a pool of volunteers that he says is now larger than the Peace Corps.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 19:40:33 -0400",
    "summary": "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said there is a \"void of data\" on the COVID booster shots.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that the agency is now looking at whether it will still approve COVID-19 vaccines for next winter, citing a lack of data on booster shots.",
      "\"We're taking a look. I can't comment on any particular application. As you know, we have a bunch of applications for those booster shots,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett.",
      "Makary said many health care workers did not get the last round of COVID-19 vaccine booster shots, calling it \"a bit of a public trust problem.\"",
      "\"I think there's a void of data. And I think rather than allow that void to be filled with opinions, I'd like to see some good data,\" Makary said.",
      "His answer marks a change from during the Biden administration, when FDA officials backed plans to routinely update the COVID-19 vaccines each year.",
      "Last year, the FDA issued guidance on what strain should be targeted by the shots for the following winter. Updates to Moderna and Pfizer's COVID shots for the new strain were approved in August.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also now weighing whether to significantly narrow its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Makary's remarks echo his justification for delaying Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to get full approval on April 1. Novavax said Monday that the FDA had asked the company to commit to another clinical trial of the shot.",
      "\"Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is does it provide a benefit? Without a study on the new formulation and product, we can't give an honest evidence-based answer to that question,\" Makary told the newsletter \"Inside Medicine\" this week.",
      "Multiple companies are now also being asked \"to do clinical studies, a basic clinical study, so we can educate the population and have information to work with,\" Makary told CBS News.",
      "\"It's my general feeling, not with this particular product, which I can't discuss in depth, but with drugs in general, that we need to know if they work today in order to be able to recommend them,\" he said.",
      "He also praised his special assistant, Dr. Tracy Beth H\u00f8eg, when asked what role she played in the agency's evaluation of Novavax's application.",
      "\"Dr. H\u00f8eg is an amazing M.D.-Ph.D. who has joined my staff as a special assistant to the commissioner. And she is involved in reviewing data sets at the agency. And I'm really excited to have her in the process,\" Makary said.",
      "Trade industry publication The Pink Sheet previously reported that H\u00f8eg had been asked to step in on Novavax's application. H\u00f8eg was also added to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunizations, in a slot previously filled by a career vaccines official from the FDA.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump marked the first 100 days in office of his second term with a Tuesday evening\u00a0rally\u00a0outside Detroit \u2014 spending much of his 90-minute speech touting his administration's record on immigration and lashing out against judges, Biden-era officials and other foes.",
      "\"We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country, and that's according to many, many people,\" Mr. Trump said to kick off his speech at Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan. \"This is the best, they say, 100-day start of any president in history, and everyone is saying it. We've just gotten started. You haven't even seen anything yet.\"",
      "The president chose to give his speech in the heart of the auto industry, as he hopes the tariffs he's imposing on imports from other countries will bring auto companies and other manufacturers back to the U.S., despite economists' warnings that the president's policies will increase prices. On Tuesday, the president signed executive orders to provide some relief from the 25% tariffs he's imposing on imported foreign cars and parts.",
      "As the president's approval numbers have slipped since his inauguration, Mr. Trump particularly homed in on his administration's border enforcement policies. Immigration continues to be one of the president's strongest issues in polling.",
      "\"There's never been such a difference in anything as the difference between the border today and the border what it was just six months ago, so I want to say congratulations, America, it's about time,\" he said.",
      "As the Trump administration faces a slew of lawsuits over its mass deportations and other immigration policies, the president said, \"the courts are giving us a hard time.\" Mr. Trump said his administration has significantly increased arrests of \"known and suspected terrorists,\" appearing to reference suspected gang members.",
      "\"We tried to get it higher, we tried to get it higher, but the courts are giving us a hard time, can you believe?\" Mr. Trump said. \"You know, I won on the basis of, I think, the number one thing was on illegal immigration, the border. \u2026 I think that was the number one thing, and now the courts are trying to say that you know, that doesn't matter. I don't think it's going to be allowed to stand.\"",
      "\"I hope for the sake of our country that the Supreme Court is going to save this,\" Mr. Trump said later.",
      "As nations scramble to reach deals with the White House over the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed, the president boasted that leaders from around the world are traveling to meet with him.",
      "\"Now, we're respected all over the world,\" he said. \"They're coming from all over the world to see your president. They're coming from India, they're coming from France, they're coming from Spain. Yeah, they're coming from China, too, yeah, they're coming from China. They're coming from all over to see your president. They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. And you know, we'll make deals, but we don't have to.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also touted slower inflation, but criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying he's \"not really doing a good job.\" The Fed has drawn Mr. Trump's ire for declining to speed up interest rate cuts so far this year, which could boost economic growth at the cost of higher inflation. Powell has also warned Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs could push up consumer prices and harm the economy.",
      "The president also touted his administration's work to slash government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. He also mentioned his administration's instruction to federal employees to return to the office, saying some federal workers improved their golf handicap while working remotely.",
      "\"They weren't working at home. Who the hell would work at home? How do you work at home?\" he said.",
      "The president called multiple aides on stage, including special assistant to the president Margo Martin. \"Trump 2028, anybody?\" she said, to cheers from the crowd. Mr. Trump has periodically floated seeking a third term \u2014 and his online store sells \"Trump 2028\" merchandise \u2014 though the Constitution only allows presidents to be elected to two terms.",
      "Mr. Trump also touted his administration's work on hot-button social issues.",
      "\"I ended all of the lawless so-called diversity, equity and inclusion bulls***, all across the federal government and the private sector,\" the president claimed. \"And I made it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. And the really easy one, this was the easiest one I had, I banned men from competing in women's sports.\"",
      "The president doesn't have the authority to do all those things in the private sector and at the local level, but the administration has sought to influence those spheres.",
      "As Republicans struggle to figure out how to pay for the president's tax cuts, making cuts to Medicaid has been a possible pay-for. But the president insisted he'll protect Medicaid.",
      "\"We will always protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors, with no cuts, and we will defend Medicaid for those great people that are in need,\" Mr. Trump said as he neared the end of his speech. \"House Republicans are working to invest more money in Medicaid than we spend today. The only thing we're going to cut is the corruption and the crooks that take advantage of some of the illegal schemes. So we want to preserve Medicaid for the most vulnerable, for our kids, pregnant women, the poor and disabled Americans.\"",
      "What to know about Trump's first 100 days",
      "In his Michigan speech, Mr. Trump hit many of the highlights of his second term so far, including mass deportation operations, efforts to shrink the size and scope of government and the changes he's making to the global trade landscape. Those endeavors have not gone unopposed, prompting scores of lawsuits filed by ousted government employees, migrants fighting their deportation and business owners who argue the president's tariffs are unlawful.",
      "\"[I]nflation has cooled, consumer prices dropped month-over-month for the first time in three years, and gas prices are lower across the country,\" the White House said in announcing the speech, and it went on to praise the Department of Government Efficiency for rooting out \"waste, fraud, and abuse across the executive branch\" and canceling \"numerous discriminatory DEI contracts.\"",
      "DOGE's work continues apace, with billionaire Elon Musk unofficially guiding efforts to downsize government. So far, however, DOGE's cuts aren't anywhere close to approaching the $2 trillion Musk initially said he'd slash from annual spending. Those efforts have also landed the federal government in multiple courtrooms over the firings, downsizing and elimination of government-funded programs.",
      "The Trump administration claims it has done more to secure the border in the president's first 100 days in office than any other president in history. Illegal border crossings\u00a0have reached\u00a0lows not seen in decades, and the administration has been working to deport migrants accused or convicted of violent crimes and drug-related offenses. But Mr. Trump's decision to invoke wartime authorities to send migrants to an El Salvador prison without due process has resulted in lawsuits, as has the president's efforts to end\u00a0birthright citizenship.",
      "The 100-day mark comes as the Trump administration is hashing out trade negotiations with countries across the world after Mr. Trump levied nearly worldwide tariffs on foreign imports, tariffs that most economists say will make goods more expensive and worsen economic prospects. Mr. Trump claimed in an interview with TIME that he's reached 200 trade deals with other countries since April 2, but declined to name any of the countries. Americans are skeptical of the president's tariff approach, CBS News polling shows, and most worry they'll contribute to higher prices at a time when high prices are a top concern for voters.",
      "It's unclear how much the president will focus on foreign policy matters, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued the administration has made significant progress on the foreign policy front. After repeatedly saying he would end the war in Ukraine before even taking office, Mr. Trump is now saying those comments were made in \"jest.\"",
      "\"We are closer today to a peace deal in Russia and Ukraine, certainly, than we were when we took office on Jan. 20,\" Leavitt told reporters Monday. \"If you look at the situation in the Middle East, Israel has never had a stronger friend than they do right now in the Oval Office with President Trump. We've had more than 75 hostages who have returned home from around the world who were wrongfully detained individuals.\"",

      "In his initial post on X, Hegseth called the Women, Peace and Security program \"yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops.\" In a follow-up post, he clarified that the program had been \"ruined\" by the Biden administration.",

      "Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and national security adviser Mike Waltz, supported the efforts when they were in Congress. It was also championed by Mr. Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, who served in the White House during his first term.",

      "FBI Director Kash Patel claimed last week that Dugan \"intentionally misdirected federal agents away\" from the\u00a0immigrant\u00a0in question, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz.",

      "Court documents suggest Dugan was alerted to the agents' presence by her clerk, who was informed by an attorney that they appeared to be in the hallway.",
      "An FBI affidavit says Dugan was \"visibly angry\" over the agents' arrival and called the situation \"absurd\" before leaving the bench and retreating to her chambers. It says she and another judge later approached members of the arrest team inside the courthouse with what witnesses described as a \"confrontational, angry demeanor.\"",
      "After a back-and-forth with officers over the warrant for Flores-Ruiz, she demanded they speak with the chief judge and led them away from the courtroom, the affidavit says.",
      "After directing the agents to the chief judge's office, investigators say, Dugan returned to the courtroom and was heard saying words to the effect of \"wait, come with me\" before ushering Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer through the jury door into a nonpublic area.",
      "The action was unusual, the affidavit says, because \"only deputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies used the back jury door. Defense attorneys and defendants who were not in custody never used the jury door.\"",
      "Dugan's arrests has sparked outrage among Democrats, who have accused the Trump administration of trying to chill the judiciary. Demonstrators gathered outside the FBI's Milwaukee field office Saturday to protest her arrest.",

    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

      "Canada's Liberal Party won Monday's federal election, marking a sharp political turnaround seemingly powered largely by the territorial threats and tariff tactics of President Trump.",
      "Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals were projected to win more of the Canadian Parliament's 343 seats than the rival Conservatives. It wasn't immediately clear if the Liberals would claim an outright majority of at least 172 seats, or if they'd be forced to rely on lawmakers from a smaller party or parties to get new legislation passed.",
      "Canadians decided with Monday's vote to grant the Liberal Party a fourth term in power, now with Carney at the helm, rather than to transfer control to the Conservatives and their populist leader Pierre Poilievre, who only months earlier had been projected to win the election decisively.",
      "The Liberal Party's popularity had been declining for years, eventually leading to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation in March, and the Conservatives appeared poised to take control of the federal government \u2014 until Mr. Trump stepped in.",
      "The American president's previous repeated\u00a0threats to annex Canada and his sweeping tariffs, which have undermined Canada's economy, had dominated the campaign and influenced voters' choices. Domestic issues including affordability, immigration, jobs and crime remained significant factors.",
      "\"As I have been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never,\" declared Carney in a victory speech on Monday evening. \"These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Calling it a \"hinge moment\" in history, Carney said Canada's \"old relationship with the United States \u2014 a relationship based on steadily increasing integration \u2014 is over. The system of open global trade, anchored by the United States, a system that Canada has relied on since the Second World War, a system that, while not perfect, has helped deliver prosperity for our country for decades, is over. These are tragedies, but it's also our new reality... We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons. We have to look out for ourselves and, above all, we have to take care of each other.\"",

      "\"The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the United States working together - as independent, sovereign nations - for their mutual betterment,\" Carney's office said in a statement. \"To that end, the leaders agreed to meet in person in the near future.\"",
      "Poilievre, a seasoned politician for the Conservatives, lost his parliamentary seat in Ottawa, casting doubt on his continued leadership of the party. Monday's election marked a significant turn of events for the leader, who was first elected to the parliament in 2004.",
      "Despite the blow, Poilievre vowed to remain in his position as party leader, and he pledged in a speech Monday night to keep fighting for change.",
      "\"Every single day, our conservative caucus and I will be holding the government to account on behalf of millions of Canadians who believed in the message of change,\" Poilievre told his party's supporters.",
      "According to Elections Canada, a record number of Canadians \u2014 an estimated 7.3 million \u2014  cast their votes in advance, a 25% increase compared to the 2021 elections.",
      "A diverse group of voters gathered Monday inside a school gym in Milton City, Ontario, to cast their ballots. While they were divided on who would be best to deal with Mr. Trump, they all agreed that Canada's sovereignty, tariffs and the affordability of everyday goods were the main issues on their minds as they cast their votes.",
      "\"Trump's decisions are affecting not just Canada but the rest of the world,\" a couple who voted for the Liberals told CBS News outside a polling station. \"The tariffs affected the market; it affected prices of all goods, food, anything.\"",
      "Opponents cast the Conservatives' leader Poilievre as having similarities with Mr. Trump, which may have ended up costing him on election day.",
      "\"A couple of things that, unfortunately, Pierre has come out with which we didn't agree with,\" the couple in Milton City, who wished to remain anonymous, told CBS News. \"Might sound silly, but the fact he wants to bring back plastic bags and straws \u2014 I didn't like that idea.\"",
      "One voter named Peter said he considered the issue of Canadian sovereignty while casting his vote. Although he did not specify which party he believed could best address concerns over Mr. Trump's threats to make Canada a \"51st state,\" he stressed the need for Canadian unity.",
      "John Ivsky, a self-employed businessman from Milton, said he considered the election crucial, emphasizing the issue of tariffs. He said Canada should seek more and different global partners.",
      "\"Canada needs to build its own economy and broader partnerships,\" Ivsky told CBS News. \"America shouldn't be the only economic, military, or political partner. We need partners all over the world, so we don't suffer from one political change in one country.\"",
      "\"I respect and vote for every party that can support family values, conservative values, freedom of speech, and I vote for the one that can reflect my beliefs, whether that's Liberal or Conservative,\" said Ivsky. \"At this point, Conservatives are the ones that can do that.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump once again injected himself into the election campaign. In a post on Truth Social, he repeated his idea of making Canada the 51st U.S. state and called on Canadian voters to vote for the person who could make that possible \u2014 without naming either political party.",
      "\"Good luck to the Great people of Canada. Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size,\u00a0 WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st State of the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "In response to his remarks, Poilievre said Canada would never become the 51st state, and he urged the American president to stay out of Canadian elections.",
      "\"President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,\" Poilievre said in French in a social media\u00a0post. \"Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st State. Today Canadians can vote for change so we can strengthen our country, stand on our own two feet and stand up to America from a position of strength.\"",
      "In his campaign, Carney pleaded with voters to deliver him a strong mandate to deal with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"President Trump has some obsessive ideas, and that is one,\" Carney said of the annexation threats. \"It's not a joke. It's his very strong desire to make this happen. It's one of the reasons why this crisis is so serious.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's executive orders have been aimed at major changes, such as declaring a national emergency along the border in his first day in office, an attempt to move toward ending birthright citizenship and taking steps to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "Mr. Trump has also signed executive actions on less high-impact issues, such as an executive order on April 9 aimed at \"maintaining water pressure in showerheads.\"",
      "According to data from UC Santa Barbara's\u00a0The American Presidency Project, the 142 executive orders Mr. Trump has signed are more than any president in history in the first 100 days, with Franklin Delano Roosevelt previously holding the record. These 142 executive orders are also more than former Presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama and George W. Bush signed in the first three years of their terms. And Mr. Trump has signed more executive orders in his first 100 days than what 15 presidents signed over their entire terms.",
      "Bills signed into law: 5",
      "Alongside the slew of executive action, Mr. Trump has signed only a handful of bills into law in the first 100 days of his second term \u2014 far less than the 28 he signed by this time in his first term.",
      "In January, the president first signed the Laken Riley Act, which aims to expand the federal government's mandate to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally, into law. The president also signed a continuing resolution in March to keep the government funded through September.",
      "Mr. Trump has also signed three resolutions rolling back Biden administration regulations \u2014 a rule from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management regulating oil and gas production, another from the Environmental Protection Agency imposing a charge on oil and natural gas facilities that exceed emissions thresholds, and one related to reporting requirements for digital asset sales.",
      "The small number of bills signed into law comes amid GOP control of both chambers of Congress. But narrow margins, especially in the House, have drawn out some legislative fights. Meanwhile, GOP leaders in Congress have their focus set on a massive legislative package that is key to enacting the president's first-year agenda, which they're aiming to make significant progress on in the coming weeks.",
      "Legal challenges: 307",
      "The large amount of executive actions signed as well as the massive changes the administration is hoping to enact has opened them up to legal challenges. While the cases are still in their early stages, federal judges across the country have issued orders blocking the administration from enforcing many of the president's key policies while proceedings move forward.",
      "Ten of the legal disputes have already made their way to the Supreme Court through its emergency docket.",
      "The high court has scheduled oral arguments for three emergency appeals arising from Mr. Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship, which will take place during a special session on May 15. In those cases, the Justice Department has asked the high court to narrow the scope of the nationwide injunctions issued by federal district court judges to apply only to the plaintiffs that brought the suits.",
      "The Supreme Court will not decide the merits of Mr. Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, but only whether to allow the administration to enforce it against those not involved in the legal challenges. The court will also have the chance to weigh in on whether district court judges go too far when they issue nationwide, or universal, orders that block enforcement of a policy across the country.",
      "Requests for emergency relief have come in challenges involving the transgender military ban, removals of Venezuelan migrants under the Alien Enemies Act, the firings of members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board, the mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, the mass terminations of federal probationary employees, the cancellation of Education Department grants, the removal of special counsel Hampton Dellinger and the unfreezing of $2 billion in foreign-aid funding.",
      "Nights away from the White House: 28",
      "In Mr. Trump's first week in office, he visited Asheville, North Carolina, which had been ravaged by Hurricane Helene, and Los Angeles, which was recovering from deadly wildfires in January.",
      "The bulk of his trips, however, have been to his properties, including 20 nights at Mar-a-Lago, a night at Trump International Hotel Las Vegas when he was returning from L.A. and last weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, after he returned from Pope Francis' funeral at the Vatican.",
      "Border crossings: 15,500 (February-March)",
      "Mr. Trump has touted his administration's hardline immigration efforts. Border crossings are publicly reported monthly and in the two full months since Mr. Trump took office, the number of people illegally crossing the border dropped to the lowest amount since there was publicly available data.",
      "In February, there were 8,450 border crossings, which at the time was the lowest monthly apprehensions tally recorded by Border Patrol since at least fiscal year 2000, the first year with publicly available data. In March, that number dropped to 7,100, which the agency said is a 95% decrease from a year earlier.",
      "Jobs cut by DOGE: at least 119,659",
      "Mr. Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, via executive action on his first day in office, to be helmed by Elon Musk. In the 100 days since then, the administration has claimed Musk has no formal role at DOGE, but the agency has steamrolled through the federal workforce.",
      "One of the biggest targets was the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. In February, 1,600 USAID employees were laid off as part of a \"reduction-in-force\" and another 4,080 were terminated via an email to employees, sources said, leading the agency to be shuttered.",
      "The cuts at USAID are just part of the total of at least 119,659 cuts across all agencies, according to a CBS News analysis. That number includes 10,000 who were terminated from the Health and Human Services in March, as well as 80,000 at the Department of Veterans Affairs.",
      "Tariffs on China: 147%",
      "On a day that the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day,\" Mr. Trump announced on April 2 reciprocal tariffs on major U.S. trading partners. After market volatility, he put most of those tariffs on pause, with the exception of China. As the rhetoric escalated between the two countries, Mr. Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, and China has slapped tariffs on American imports to 125%.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine published Friday, Mr. Trump said Xi has called him, although the president didn't reveal when the two spoke or what Xi said. China has denied that the two spoke.",
      "There is also a 10% across the board baseline tariff on most imported goods that went into effect on April 2. A CBS News poll released Sunday shows that 48% of Americans say Mr. Trump's policies are making them financially worse off.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed to bring transparency to the American people.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0 Forty-five days into a U.S. air campaign against Iranian-backed Houthis, American forces have hit more than 1,000 targets in Yemen. Yet, despite promises from Trump administration officials to run \"the most transparent Defense Department in history,\" the Pentagon has held just one formal briefing in the first 100 days of President Trump's second term.",
      "\"In line with the secretary's vision to make this the most transparent Department of Defense in history, I gave you my personal commitment to make these briefings more routine,\" said top Pentagon public affairs aide Sean Parnell on March 17, during the only formal briefing conducted so far.",
      "During the same period, the White House and State Department have held 18 and 13 briefings, respectively, as of April 28.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Pentagon had 34 on-camera briefings in its first 100 days while Biden's White House and State Department held 61 and 34 briefings, respectively. During the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's first term, reporters received five on-camera briefings from the Defense Department.",
      "The Pentagon has a long history of briefing the media about military operations. Until his departure in 1968, Barry Zorthian would climb to the rooftop of Saigon's Rex Hotel to give reporters the Pentagon's official version of the Vietnam War. The briefings were branded the \"Five O'Clock Follies\" by skeptical reporters, but even so, the dialogue between spokesperson and journalist provided a critical stream of information about what the government was doing on behalf of American citizens.",
      "The tradition stretched across wars \u2014 from Desert Storm in 1991 to the 1999 Kosovo air campaign \u2014\u00a0 and even during the Biden administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Pentagon continued to brief the press regularly.",
      "Retired Rear Adm. T. McCreary, who ran the Navy's public affairs office as the chief of naval information from 2003 to 2006, told CBS News there are three reasons to hold news briefings: To get your story out first, so the public reacts to you; second, to stop the spread of the enemy putting out disinformation to spin the story; and third, to inform the taxpayers what the Pentagon, which has the largest discretionary budget of any department, is doing with its money.",
      "\"Every time the Pentagon and the [Defense Department] establishments start being less forthcoming with information, it erodes the trust and transparency that was built up over years to where the faith and the establishment sometimes starts getting questioned,\" McCreary said.",
      "The Office of the Secretary of Defense's Principles of Information details the Pentagon's guidelines for public affairs. Included is the promise to \"make available timely and accurate information so that the public, the Congress, and the news media may assess and understand the facts about national security and defense strategy.\"",
      "The single on-camera briefing the Pentagon held 43 days ago took place in the days after U.S. Central Command launched the ongoing campaign against the Houthis. Parnell, the chief spokesperson, and the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich answered questions on the operation.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has held news conferences and short question and answer sessions with a small group of reporters while traveling but has not yet conducted an on-camera briefing in the Pentagon Briefing Room, which accommodates about 60 reporters. He has, however, used the briefing room on at least four separate occasions as a backdrop for live interviews with Fox News.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. Central Command issued a press release boasting of hundreds of enemy fighters killed and dozens of command and storage centers destroyed under Operation Rough Rider. The targets, officials said, included advanced missiles, drones, and vessels used in Houthi attacks on commercial shipping lanes\u2014claims offered with little public scrutiny and even fewer questions answered as the total cost of the campaign nears $1 billion, CNN reported.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Pentagon and U.S. Central Command with questions on Monday, but neither one has responded.",
      "Soon after the campaign against the Houthis began, Hegseth was embroiled in controversy over sensitive details he shared over Signal on March 15 ahead of the initial strikes.",
      "Hegseth has denied sending any classified information, but over a month later, his use of Signal is still under scrutiny, following the revelation that he shared similar updates in a second chat that included his wife, brother and personal attorney.",
      "In that same month, five officials in Hegseth's inner circle have either been fired or left their positions, including John Ullyot, who briefly served as Pentagon Press Secretary and wrote an op-ed after his departure claiming there is \"total chaos\" at the Pentagon.",
      "Hegseth and Parnell, the chief spokesperson, have both denied these claims and have on social media blamed the stories on the media and disgruntled employees, but they have not briefed journalists to address questions.",
      "\"I think the administration would like to talk about something besides Signal, but the problem is they keep screwing it up,\" a former senior defense official told CBS News. \"You know the first thing about being in a bad news cycle is to stop creating news.\"",
      "During the Biden administration, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in the aftermath of his hospitalization scandal, took questions from the podium in the Pentagon press briefing room. For about 40 minutes, he answered questions and apologized for not disclosing his hospitalization and cancer diagnosis.",
      "\"It is hard to overstate the importance of having the Pentagon hold regular press briefings,\" said Howard Altman, president of the Military Reporters and Editors association in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"The American public has a right to know how and why taxpayer dollars are spent, how those in uniform are faring and, within the boundaries of operational security, the dangers our troops and nation face\u2026this is not a partisan issue,\" he said. \"It is an American one. A well-informed public is a cornerstone of our democracy.\"",
      "Parnell has been going to X to provide weekly situation reports \u2014 or sitreps \u2014 where he talks straight to the camera about Pentagon updates as part of the administration's promise of transparency. The videos released each week do not provide the opportunity for the media to ask questions.",
      "Instead of regular press engagements, the Pentagon in February created DOD Rapid Response, a social media account on X. The account's bio states it is \"Supporting The Mission of SecDef [Hegseth] And Fighting Against Fake News!\"",
      "The account commonly attacks news publications and\u00a0 posts comments criticizing reporting about Hegseth and the Defense Department. The X account has omitted context from its statements, touting an increase in U.S. military recruiting numbers between February 2024 through February 2025, even though much of the credit for improved recruitment numbers belongs to Biden administration, as CBS News' Confirmed team found.",
      "The account also posted misleading statements about the Signal chat scandal reported by The Atlantic. The account is overseen by conservative podcaster and Army veteran Graham Allen, who is now the Pentagon's digital media director.",
      "\"Holding your policies up to the light of media scrutiny is a good, healthy thing,\" a second former senior defense official said. \"Over time, that scrutiny is very good for the policymaking process because reporters are going to think of things, and they're going to approach the way to ask questions in ways that the policy thinkers and the policy makers may not have done.\"",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, citing a report that Amazon plans to display tariff charges on imported goods, called the move \"a hostile and political act.\"",
      "The e-commerce giant plans to display new tariff costs next to products' prices, political news site Punchbowl\u00a0reported earlier Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. The move would provide shoppers with clarity into the cost of the new levies on imported goods.",
      "\"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\" Leavitt said during a press briefing Tuesday.",
      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",
      "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" said Tim Doyle, an Amazon spokesperson.",
      "President Trump confirmed to reporters that he spoke with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on the phone Tuesday morning.",
      "\"Jeff Bezos was very nice,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. And he did the right thing.\"",
      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",
      "Earlier this month, data showed that\u00a0Amazon sellers had already hiked prices on nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%.",
      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "President Trump has made a series of false or misleading statements about consumer prices, while shoppers are seeing some tariff-related cost hikes.",
    "story": [
      "In the last week, President Trump has made a number of inaccurate claims that the prices of everyday items like gas and groceries have fallen since he took office \u2014 even as Americans are starting to face surcharges for some items as a result of his tariff hikes.",
      "While Mr. Trump touts his economic record in interviews with the press, he has claimed without evidence that consumers are seeing record low prices at their gas pumps and exaggerated the decline in crude oil prices since he took office. The president has also falsely stated that he has overseen a drop in grocery prices.",
      "Here's a breakdown of some of these claims:",
      "Trump's false claim that gas hit $1.98 a gallon in some places",
      "Trump said April 22: \"I see that we had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon. Nobody thought they'd see that for years maybe.\"",
      "Mr. Trump repeatedly claimed that gas prices dropped to a low of $1.98 in a few states in April, hitting lows not seen since his first term. However, that is not true; on average, gas prices are around the same as when the president took office in January.",
      "Data from the Energy Information Administration shows a national average of about $3.14 per gallon of regular gas as of the third week in April \u2014 which is slightly higher than the $3.11 the week Mr. Trump was inaugurated.",
      "GasBuddy, a company that tracks prices at more than 150,000 gas stations across the country, told CBS News it had not found evidence of a gas station selling gas for $1.98 per gallon in April.",
      "Patrick De Haan, who leads petroleum analysis with the company, said the lowest price they could find in April was $2.19 at a gas station in Texas.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim that gas prices are at their lowest level since his first term is also not true; gas prices were lower than they are now for the first six months of Biden's presidency.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for more information on the president's claim.",
      "Trump's partially true claim that crude oil prices have dropped significantly since he took office",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"Energy is down and we're about $64 a barrel. When I came in\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and we were looking at $89, $90, $95.\"",
      "The president also claimed crude oil prices dropped to about $64 a barrel, from around $89 when he took office.",
      "A White House spokesman said the president was referring to the price per barrel of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark. According to data from FactSet, Mr. Trump accurately described the current price of Brent crude, which was about $64 a barrel on April 28, but he also exaggerated the price at the time he assumed office, which was about $80. The White House did not explain the discrepancy.",
      "According to a recent Energy Information Administration report, Mr. Trump's tariff hikes in early April contributed to declines in oil prices as traders weighed the potential impact on global demand. An early April announcement that OPEC members\u00a0would increase oil production ahead of schedule also added to the downward pressure on prices.",
      "Trump's misleading claim that the price of groceries came down since he took office",
      "Trump said April 24: \"Groceries are down.\" Trump said April 17: \"Food is down. Groceries, as we call it, are down.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that grocery prices have declined since he took office. However, Consumer Price Index data shows average cost of groceries in March increased by 0.49% from the previous month and by 2.4% compared to the previous year.",
      "Prices vary across products, and the White House said the president was referring to declines in the consumer prices of certain grocery store items like fresh vegetables. The USDA's Food Price Outlook shows that fresh vegetable prices decreased 1.1% in March, after falling by 1.7% in February. However, the same report also shows the prices of beef, poultry, eggs, and nonalcoholic beverages all ticked up in March.",
      "These increases occurred before the president imposed a baseline 10% tariff on goods from most countries in early April as well as tariffs as high as 145% on imports from China. Economists expect the prices of some grocery store items, including coffee and chocolate, will rise as a result, which could be reflected when data for April is released in the coming weeks.",
      "Trump's false claim that egg prices have gone down 87%",
      "Trump said on April 24: \"So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House, thousands and thousands of eggs, and the price was down 87% so we did a great job.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed that egg prices are down significantly, without clarifying whether he is referring to wholesale or consumer prices. The president has a point that wholesale prices have declined since he took office, but he overstates the size of the decline. And recent data suggests consumer prices remain elevated.",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 what large buyers such as Costco or Walmart pay producers \u2014 have dropped sharply since mid-March as egg losses due to bird flu decreased last month. U.S. Department of Agriculture data shows wholesale egg prices were roughly 52% lower on April 25 than they were at the start of Mr. Trump's second term. The White House did not explain the discrepancy in the president's figures.",
      "Meanwhile, retail prices for consumers remain at record highs. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released on April 10 shows average retail egg prices hit $6.23 per dozen in March, surpassing the previous record $5.90 set in February.",
      "A March 28 report from the Department of Agriculture said it can take \"up to three weeks\" for consumers to benefit from the wholesale price decline. If retail prices show consistent decline, this should be reflected in the national average from BLS for April, said Jeremy Horpedahl, an associate professor of economics at the University of Central Arkansas.

    "summary": "A ruling by the Supreme Court in favor of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would lead to the country's first religious charter school.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday is set to hear arguments in a high-profile dispute over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "A decision follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions. But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing. \"",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Just eight justices will hear arguments in the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett has recused herself. Though she did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",
      "Because of Barrett's recusal, the Supreme Court could deadlock 4-4. That result would leave in place the ruling from the Oklahoma Supreme Court that found the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic public charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "A decision is expected by the end of June or early July.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's emerging media strategy focuses on the 8 a.m. hour of a Fox News program frequently watched by MAGA loyalists and their boss: President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "When the Justice Department first notified reporters of an 8:15 a.m. press conference at a nondescript federal office complex in Manassas, Virginia, last month, the agency wouldn't reveal why, instead alluding to a major pending announcement.",
      "But the agency did release information about the topic in advance to the Fox News Channel, which prepared coverage and aired a live feed of Attorney General Pam Bondi announcing the arrest of a man she called the \"East Coast leader\" of the transnational MS-13 gang. Exclusive images of the bust were prominently displayed on Fox's morning program.",
      "The press conference was an early test of the Trump administration's emerging media strategy, targeting the 8 a.m. hour of a cable news program frequently watched by MAGA loyalists and their boss: President Trump.",
      "The announcement of the arrest of the alleged MS-13 kingpin\u00a0 offered a colorful media moment for Bondi and the newly-installed FBI Director Kash Patel. Outfitted in an FBI windbreaker and cap, Patel began his remarks by touting\u00a0the arrest as the work of an agency that allows \"good cops to be good cops.\"",
      "Bondi, Patel and Virginia Gov. Glenn Younkin, who joined the March 27 news conference, didn't reveal the name of the man arrested during the press event, but the announcement nevertheless yielded local and national news coverage through the day and night, including a segment on \"Fox and Friends\" that the agency would also share on social media.",
      "A month later, the Justice Department is seeking to drop the criminal case against the man, Henrry Villatoro Santos, to instead expedite his deportation. The department has never publicly revealed any alleged connection to violent MS-13 crimes.",
      "One former agency official told CBS News the media strategy for some Trump administration initiatives revolves around unveiling and defending the move while Mr. Trump is watching television.",
      "\"Often, there's an audience of one. No other press really matters,\" the official said.",
      "That theory is supported by Mr. Trump's remarks Monday at a Rose Garden celebration of the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia Eagles. During his remarks, the president looked in the direction of Bondi and said, \"Good job on television this morning, Pam.\"\u00a0 Bondi had appeared during the 8 a.m. hour on \"Fox and Friends\" earlier that day.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth adopted a similar approach\u00a0 after a second wave of controversy over his use of the Signal messaging app last week. Hegseth defended his performance and sought to defuse the controversy during an exclusive interview in the 8 a.m. hour on \"Fox and Friends.\"",
      "Days earlier, the Justice Department announced a civil lawsuit against the state of Maine over its policies on transgender athletes during a news conference in the 8 a.m. hour. Frequent Fox News Channel guests, of which Bondi is one, were featured prominently at the event held in the Justice Department's 7th-floor press room, along with former Olympic athlete Riley Gaines. The news conference was lengthy and included declarative statements of praise for Mr. Trump.",
      "The White House followed a similar rhythm this week as it marks the milestone of 100 days in office and navigates sinking poll numbers for Mr. Trump.\u00a0 White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and \"border czar\" Tom Homan answered questions in the 8 a.m. hour on Monday, and made the case that the president has secured a series of accomplishments on border issues. Leavitt also shared mugshot-style photos of alleged undocumented criminals that were posted on the White House North Lawn.",
      "Frank Sesno, a former CNN anchor who is now executive director of the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs, said the administration's strategy is leveraging a potent hour of the day to drive a political message.",
      "\"It's fresh for morning television. It sets the agenda for the rest of the day. It can drive the conversation on talk radio and the blogosphere and elsewhere,\" Sesno told CBS News.",
      "Sesno said the administration's focus on the Fox News Channel's audience is no surprise.",
      "\"The White House is jumping on the Fox News cycle to hit the Fox audience, which is the largest cable news audience out there,\" he said. \"It's not the least bit surprising they're doing so, since the administration basically hired half of Fox News to come populate their Cabinet.\"",
      "Leavitt declined to answer specific questions about the evolving media strategy, instead issuing a statement to CBS News, saying, \"We are flattered that CBS is asking the Trump White House how to make good TV. Clearly they need the advice!\"",
      "One former official who worked in both Trump administrations noted how the 8:15 a.m. news conferences can yield a live audience without the editing, filtering and journalistic review of news by editors.",
      "The arrest of Villatoro-Santos, for example, reached an audience of millions without the Department of Justice ever revealing the specific accusations in his case. The Justice Department will ask a judge to dismiss his case tomorrow in federal court in Virginia.",

    "story": [
      "At age 90, Ren\u00e9e Richards plays a lot of golf.",
      "\"Yesterday I played 18 holes. I'm going to play 18 holes in my league today, and if I feel okay, I'll play 18 holes tomorrow,\" said Richards recently.",
      "The former professional tennis player and ophthalmologist made headlines in the 1970s, when after transitioning to female she sued and won the right to play in the U.S. Open. During her half-decade pro career, Richards peaked at 20th in the world and in 1977 made the U.S. open finals in doubles, where she lost to a pair that included tennis legend Martina Navratilova.",
      "Half a century later, her views have evolved \u2014 she believes transgender women who transition after puberty should not compete in women's sports \u2014 but she's aghast at broader restrictions on transgender rights during the Trump administration's first 100 days.",
      "The State Department has halted the practice of issuing passports with \"X\" gender markers. The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip \"gender ideology\" from websites, contracts and emails. An executive order calls on the federal government \"to rescind all funds from educational programs\" that allow transgender girls and women to compete. Another order restricts access to gender-affirming care\u00a0for youth. The Department of Defense has reinstated President Trump's first term transgender military ban, and transgender federal inmates are now regarded by their sex at birth. The changes are the subject of ongoing lawsuits.",
      "First and foremost on Richards' mind: the Navy veteran believes transgender Americans should be able to serve openly in the military.",
      "\"That's terrible. You know, I can only think of myself because I was in the Navy when nobody knew that I was a transgender. I hadn't had surgery yet, but it was still me,\" said Richards, who won the All-Navy tennis championship while serving. \"That goes a long way back, but I'm still representative of the same ilk even though they didn't know it at the time.\"",
      "Richards is the subject of a forthcoming book, tentatively titled \"Finding Ren\u00e9e,\" by former Sports Illustrated editor Julie Kliegman. Richards believes the fierce debate over transgender athletes has fueled a \"jump\u2026from the sports to the military, to the education, to the bathrooms, to the passports, to the existence, to the teaching of any kind of gender.\"",
      "It's a trend that has played out in state legislatures, before and during the current Trump administration, according to Logan Casey, the director of policy research at the nonprofit Movement Advancement Project, which tracks state laws and executive orders regulating gender.",
      "Casey said state-level bans on sports prior to the current Trump administration \"laid the groundwork for all of the anti-transgender and anti-LGBTQ attacks more broadly.\"",
      "\"It sort of put sports as a foot in the door, and a framework, for how many people who had not previously thought about transgender people very much \u2014 let alone in the context of policy and law \u2014 are now thinking about it and framing it,\" said Casey, who noted the vast majority of state legislation targeting LGBTQ rights fails to become law.",
      "Ash Lazarus Orr, a spokesperson for Advocates for Trans Equality, said the language of Mr. Trump's executive orders bore similarities to orders and legislation coming out of state capitals.",
      "\"It signals back to states that, yes, this is a priority. You should continue to do this, and in fact do this and other attacks,\" said Orr, who is also the title plaintiff in a lawsuit over the Trump administration's policy requiring U.S. passports to reflect sex assigned at birth. \"While we were seeing attacks on the trans community escalating at a state level under the Biden administration, what we are seeing now under the Trump administration is absolutely an escalation.\"",
      "Former Olympic swimmer Nancy Hogshead, a Democrat who founded the nonprofit advocacy group Champion Women, believes the party is suffering from self-inflicted wounds.",
      "Hogshead, who supports efforts to align participation in sports with gender at birth, said Trump and Republicans have found a galvanizing issue.",
      "\"It is a winner for them. It is a winner for Republicans,\" Hogshead said. \"Fifty percent of all girls play sports. That is a meat and potatoes issue for them. It's not a fringe issue.\"",
      "Richards believes Trump has a similar view. She said, as an ophthalmologist, she treated one of his sisters and has met Mr. Trump once.",
      "\"He knows I'm not an ogre,\" she said. \"He sees, and his advisors advise him, that his popularity rests with the small group of people that hate the idea of transgender, period.\"",
      "Richards, whose professional tennis career began in 1977 when she was more than 40 years old, largely agrees with Hogshead. In April 2024, she provided the Women's Tennis Association with a position paper on participation of transgender women in sports, and this year allowed Sports Illustrated to publish it. In the paper, Richards concluded that people who have undergone male puberty should be ineligible to compete against biological females.",
      "Richards's paper included reflections on her time playing both as an amateur and professionally, analysis of \"the current literature on the subject,\" citing her decades as a doctor, and policy recommendations.",
      "It also touched on golf.",
      "\"My lifetime in sports is still ongoing,\" she wrote. \"I have been a member of the ladies' golf league at the public/private club near my home for the past 20 years.\"",
      "Richards spoke to CBS News on opening day last week. She said, despite politics, the women in her league still welcome her competition.",
      "\"Not only welcome and accepted, but if I didn't show up, they would have a cemetery ceremony, believe me,\" Richards said.",
      "Are there a lot of 90-year-olds there, still hitting the links?",
      "\"Yeah, me. Amongst the men and the women, I'm the only one,\" Richards said, adding that she guesses the average age at the club is 60. \"I play the forward tee, but I don't play any gold tees that are in front of that \u2014 and I hit the ball as well as they do, too.\"",

    "summary": "Most of the progress President Trump has made on his promises were achieved through executive orders.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 In the four years between his two terms, President Trump had a lot of time to consider what he could do differently if he won the presidency again. In the first 100 days of his second term, he's been able to deliver on some of the promises he repeated most during his campaign, while others remain out of reach.",
      "But much like the first 100 days of his first term, most of the progress Mr. Trump has made on his promises were achieved through executive orders.",
      "Here's a look at some of his 2024 campaign promises and their status after 100 days:",
      "The promise: End Russia-Ukraine war",
      "Mr. Trump has yet to negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, a conflict he boasted would be settled before he even took office. He said more than once he would bring the war to a close within \"24 hours\" of his second term.",
      "Despite U.S. pressure on Ukraine and to a lesser extent, Russia, there is no peace yet, or even a temporary ceasefire. The administration is now threatening to walk from negotiations with Russia and Ukraine, as Russia\u00a0continues its attacks.",
      "The promise: Pardon Jan. 6 rioters",
      "This was one of the first promises Mr. Trump delivered on upon taking office. Hours after he was sworn in, he granted clemency to about 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Among those who received clemency are people who were convicted of violent and serious crimes, including assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Mr. Trump also ordered the Justice Department to end all pending cases connected to the riot, abruptly ending the department's massive effort under former President Joe Biden to hold those who participated in the attack accountable.",
      "The promise: \"Save\" TikTok",
      "Before taking office, Mr. Trump promised to \"save\" the short-form video app used by 170 million Americans. In 2024, Congress passed a law that required TikTok to divest from its Beijing-based parent company, ByteDance, or be cut off from U.S. app-hosting stores. Despite lengthy legal wrangling, when ByteDance failed to cut ties with TikTok by Jan. 19, the deadline set by Congress, the app was effectively banned in the U.S.",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that directed the Justice Department not to enforce the law for 75 days and TikTok later reappeared in app stores. The president on April 4 again delayed enforcement of the law for another 75 days as a sale remained elusive.",
      "The promise: Make IVF free",
      "In August, Mr. Trump told voters that the government or insurance companies \"will be mandated to pay for all costs associated with IVF treatment.\" He did not elaborate how he would enact it.",
      "That has not yet come to fruition, though the president directed his administration to find ways to reduce the high costs of IVF for Americans struggling with fertility. The Feb. 18 order requested policy recommendations within 90 days.",
      "The promise: Release JFK assassination records",
      "The Trump administration released about 80,000 government documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy in mid-March. The documents had been released before, but sections were redacted for national security purposes. Many of those portions were made public with the new release.",
      "The declassified versions did not appear to contain significant new revelations about the assassination. Some documents are available in person at the National Archives, but others are still being uploaded. Additional documents remain under court seal, including some for reasons of grand jury secrecy. There are also IRS-related documents that must be unsealed before release, and the Archives and Justice Department are working on making these available.",
      "The promise: Close the Education Department",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order last month to begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education \"once and for all.\" The Education Department's workforce has already been cut in half, and there are plans to transfer some of its functions to other agencies. Still, fully eliminating the department would require an act of Congress.",
      "The promise: Carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history",
      "\"On Day One, I will launch the largest deportation program of criminals in the history of America,\" Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail.",
      "The Trump administration has aggressively pursued deportations, perhaps most notably by invoking an 18th century law known as the Alien Enemies Act that has only been used during wartime to immediately deport some migrants accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "The president's attempt to use the Alien Enemies Act for this purpose is being litigated in the courts.",
      "The promise: \"Tariff the hell\" out of countries that have taken \"advantage\" of the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump vowed to \"tariff the hell\" out of countries that he believes haven't treated the U.S. fairly on trade. He followed through on that threat for just under a week, imposing heavy tariffs on most countries based on their trade deficits with the U.S. He blinked in the face of a bond market sell-off, suspending most of the tariffs for 90 days while he and top administration officials try to negotiate trade deals with individual nations. He still kept in place tariffs adding up to 145% against China.",
      "The promise: Withdraw from the Paris climate accords",
      "Just like he did in his first term, one of Mr. Trump's first moves when he took office in January was to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, after former President Joe Biden rejoined the agreement. Countries who have signed onto the Paris accord agree to specific efforts meant to help curb climate change.",
      "The promise: Make expiring tax cuts permanent",
      "Congress is working to make the income tax cuts enacted in Mr. Trump's first term permanent. It's not something the president can do on his own. Key provisions of Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "The promise: Eliminate taxes on tips",
      "One of Mr. Trump's repeated campaign promises was eliminating federal income taxes on tips, something he found was popular with his working-class base. Republicans on the House Budget Committee estimate eliminating income taxes on tips would cost more than $100 billion over a decade.",
      "But eliminating taxes on tips would require an act of Congress, and it's not yet clear whether it will be included in the budget reconciliation package.",
      "The promise: Eliminate taxes on seniors' Social Security income",
      "Eliminating federal taxes on Social Security income is also something Mr. Trump has pledged to do. This, too, will take an act of Congress. And Congress hasn't made serious moves toward that end. Some economists warn that eliminating taxes on Social Security would create an even larger federal deficit.",
      "The promise: Stop funding for schools with vaccine and mask mandates",
      "Mr. Trump pledged during the campaign that he \"would not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate.\" He issued an executive order in February that prohibits schools and colleges with COVID-19 vaccine mandates from receiving federal money, though no states currently have such a requirement. It only applies to the COVID-19 vaccine.",
      "The promise: End birthright citizenship",
      "The president's executive order on birthright citizenship, which has long been interpreted as guaranteed under the 14th Amendment, was one of the first that he signed after he was sworn in. The order denied birthright citizenship to children born after Feb. 19 to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident.",
      "Mr. Trump's mandate has been blocked by federal courts in several states as being unconstitutional. The Supreme Court\u00a0will hear arguments in May on a Trump administration request to partially enforce the order.",
      "The promise: Cut federal funding to schools that teach \"critical race theory\" and \"transgender\" matters",
      "In January, Mr. Trump ordered schools to stop teaching what he views as \"critical race theory\" and other material related to race and sexuality. The executive order declared that K-12 schools could not use federal money on the \"indoctrination\" of children, including \"radical gender ideology and critical race theory.\"",
      "He signed a separate executive order in February to ban transgender girls and women from competing on sports teams that match their gender identity. The order mandates that Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. Those not in compliance jeopardize any federal funding they receive, Mr. Trump said.",

    "summary": "Despite President Trump's promise of cuts, the federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days than the same time period last year.",
    "story": [
      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories. Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "But even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent about $220 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",
      "Musk recently said his work with DOGE is winding down.",
      "Explore the spending details yourself",
      "You can explore the government's daily account ledgers for yourself. We've isolated the money spent by category in the first few months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period in each of the last 10 years.",
      "You can search for agencies or spending categories below to see the change over time and how much or less is being spent during this first 100 days of the Trump administration. We've limited the table to agencies and categories with at least $100 million in spending since Jan. 20, 2025.",

Mr. Trump's use of executive authority over the past 100 days also surpasses the number of executive orders signed by Obama and Bush during their entire second terms. Obama hit 129 executive orders, and Bush 118.",

      "In team-wide meetings that started last week, multiple FDA employees said they were informed by their supervisors that they should expect to have their layoffs reversed.",

      "The group of cicadas set to appear has been labeled Brood XIV. Emerging once every 17 years, Brood XIV is the second-largest group of periodical cicadas \u2014 which rise from underground en masse \u2014 and will be the only group this spring. That means\u00a0there will likely be fewer cicadas\u00a0above ground than there were in 2024, when\u00a0multiple broods of cicadas\u00a0emerged at the same time.",
      "Where will cicadas emerge in spring 2025?",

Individual \"broods\" are biologically synchronized to crop up simultaneously in 13- or 17-year intervals, when they rise from their burrows underground in populations that can reach up to the trillions. Between intervals, they live in soil as larvae and feed on fluids from plant roots, the wildlife federation explains.",
      "There are three species of cicadas that emerge every 17 years, and four species that materialize every 13 years, according to researchers at the University of Connecticut. When cicadas share the same emergence year, they're considered part of a brood.",
      "The interactive map below shows where different broods are scattered across the country.",
      "Active periodical cicada broods in the U.S.",
      "Select a brood:",
      "Why do cicadas make noise?",
      "The noise people often hear from cicadas is a mating tactic, according to the wildlife foundation, which notes that male cicadas tend to crowd together and produce raucous choruses in efforts to attract females. Once the mating process has ended, female cicadas deposit their eggs in tree branches. When they hatch, the larvae fall to the ground, burrow into the soil, and the cycle starts again.",

    "summary": "A notably large brood of periodical cicadas will emerge from the underground across parts of the eastern U.S. this spring.",
    "story": [
      "A massive brood of periodical cicadas will emerge soon across the eastern United States, with the notoriously raucous springtime insects due for their 2025 appearance.",
      "Known for their buzzing hordes and ability to rapidly infiltrate the environments where they show up, cicadas are expected to swarm parts of Kentucky and Tennessee\u00a0this year, while arriving in smaller quantities in various places along the East Coast, from Massachusetts and New York down to western Georgia.",
      "Here's what to know about the infamous creatures.",
      "What are periodical cicadas?",
      "Periodical cicadas are moderately sized bugs with red eyes and translucent wings, usually measuring about an inch long with a wider wingspan. They are sometimes mistakenly associated with locusts, like grasshoppers, but cicadas are actually an entirely different sort of insect, part of the same family as stink bugs and bedbugs.",
      "The synchronized behavior of periodical cicadas is their most defining characteristic. Compared with annual cicadas, which appear in generally modest amounts each summer, periodical cicadas emerge in the spring and essentially rise from the ground in unison, in either 13-year or 17-year intervals. Cicadas that emerge on the same schedule are called a brood, and each is labeled using Roman numerals.",
      "This year, the group belongs to Brood XIV, the second-largest brood of periodical cicadas known to scientists, according to the University of Connecticut. Researchers with the university's Cicada Project note that, while they cannot technically know with certainty where a particular brood is going to emerge next, its last known locations during previous emergence events usually provide valuable insights. Because periodical cicadas typically lay their eggs in or near the areas where they've just emerged, the next generation of broods tend to emerge themselves in similar places.",
      "Cicada map predicts where they will emerge in 2025",
      "Based on University of Connecticut research, CBS News' data team created an interactive map that charts the expected spread of Brood XIV, which last arose 17 years ago and is the only brood emerging in 2025.",
      "The map shows the cicadas primarily concentrated in Kentucky and Tennessee, in addition to parts of Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia. Farther north, the brood is also expected to take shape in smaller pockets, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts; Long Island, New York; and central Pennsylvania.",
      "When will Brood XIV emerge?",
      "The brood will emerge before the end of spring on June 21, but cicadas' arrivals in different parts of the U.S. will likely vary.",
      "Cicada expert Matthew Kasson told CBS News in 2024 that\u00a0the exact timing of a brood's emergence\u00a0is linked to the temperature of the soil they're in before moving above ground. Kasson said cicadas are prompted to exit the soil when it reaches 64 degrees, so groups within the larger brood may travel to the surface sooner than others in cooler locations.",
      "What do cicadas do?",
      "The life cycles of periodical cicadas are closely tied to how and where they emerge. Before a brood materializes on land, each of its members \u2014 sometimes trillions of them \u2014 exist underground as larvae, subsiding on fluids from plant roots, according to the National Wildlife Federation. They live in those conditions for 13 or 17 years, depending on their brood. Then, almost all at once, the insects burrow upward and break through the surface of the soil, often making their presence known by erupting in loud and at times constant choruses.",
      "Conspicuous noises from cicada swarms are a mating tactic, the wildlife federation writes, as the male insects gather in groups and create loud sounds to attract females. The mating process begins within a few days of cicadas emerging. When it ends, the females cut shallow grooves into tree branches and lay their eggs inside. Researchers at Arizona State University say\u00a0those eggs usually hatch\u00a0within 8 weeks, and newly born cicadas fall from the branches down to the ground. Called nymphs at that point, the young bugs proceed to dig their way back underneath the soil, where they remain until it's time to emerge again.",
      "Adult cicadas typically remain above ground in a given location for 4 to 6 weeks after they first emerge. Researchers note that most of the individual insects live for less time, but that window accounts for some degree of staggering when the brood emerges, since that happens over a period of about two weeks.",
      "Are cicadas dangerous?",
      "Cicadas are not dangerous to humans or pets, experts say. They don't bite or sting and they aren't poisonous or venomous.",
      "\"If dogs or cats eat many cicadas, this may temporarily cause an upset stomach or vomiting, but there is no need to worry if a pet eats a small number of cicadas,\" the Environmental Protection Agency says.",
      "They are also largely beneficial to the ecosystem. They are a food source for birds and other predators that eat insects. They can aerate soil, and when they decompose, they provide nutrients that can help trees grow.",
      "Cicadas may harm young trees, which can be protected with mesh or netting. They don't eat leaves, flowers, fruits or garden produce, the EPA says.",

The new discovery revealed the important role played by women in the oldest center of civilization in the Americas, researchers said.",
      "\"What has been discovered corresponds to a woman who apparently had elevated status, an elite woman,\" archaeologist David Palomino told AFP.",
      "The mummy was found in Aspero, a sacred site within the city of Caral that was a garbage dump for over 30 years until becoming an archaeological site in the 1990s.",
      "Palomino said the carefully preserved remains, dating to 3,000 years BC, contained skin, part of the nails and hair and was wrapped in a shroud made of several layers of fabric and a mantle of macaw feathers. Macaws are colorful birds that belong to the parrot family.",

    "summary": "Shortening permitting procedures for mining and oil drilling could adversely affect the environment, communities and endangered species, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",
      "Lawsuits to come, experts say",
      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",
      "\"Companies are very cautious before they sink millions of dollars into a well or to a mining project,\" he said. \"So I think they benefit from going slowly because they don't want to be stuck with a stranded asset or literally drill a dry hole here.\"",

      "\"It really is an astonishing type of case,\" said Steven Montgomery, an entomology consultant in Hawaii who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found just 62 of the carnivorous caterpillars in over 20 years of observing.",

    "summary": "AI seen as better than humans at online search and data analysis, but not at driving a car or customer service",
    "story": [
      "Just as Americans saw the internet as a harbinger of major change a quarter century ago, a majority today feel artificial intelligence will have a big effect on society. But more so than the internet at the time, AI is seen by many as creating more problems than it solves, with misleading AI content and AI companies' impact on the economy both areas of concern.",
      "AI's perceived impact on work looks especially mixed. More think AI will make jobs in their field easier than harder, but relatedly, Americans are likelier to see AI as decreasing than increasing the number of jobs available.",
      "There are large differences by educational attainment, with college degree holders more likely than those without degrees to say it will make jobs easier in their field. That suggests that when it comes to the way people do their work, the public mainly sees AI impacting computer-based and white-collar jobs.",
      "College grads are also likelier than those without college degrees to see the development of AI and AI companies as good for the economy. That said, the view that AI is more likely to reduce than increase the number of jobs is broad-based, spanning all levels of educational attainment.",
      "Americans are quite mixed on AI's potential impact on the economy. On balance, they are more likely to see the development of AI and AI companies as being bad for the economy than good. This is a major difference in sentiment from the early internet years. In CBS News polling done in 1999, seven in 10 felt the \"rapid growth in the number of internet companies\" was good for the economy. Notably, Americans are also much less optimistic than AI experts, particularly on the potential benefits of the technology for work and the economy.",
      "What can AI do better?",
      "There are some things most Americans agree AI can already do better than a human. That list includes finding things on the internet, correcting writing and grammar, and analyzing data \u2014 all tasks that tend to be structured, and perhaps even tedious for many people.",
      "The list of things people feel AI does worse than humans is wide-ranging and instructive. Some lean more on interpersonal skills, like providing customer service. Some involve creativity, like creating art, which AI is seen as worse at by a wide margin. The other items may be seen as more dependent on judgment and involving higher stakes. These include medical diagnoses, financial decisions and the item on which the largest majority say AI is worse: driving a car.",
      "People are very mixed on whether AI can produce accurate information better than humans can today. And whether it can or not, half of Americans are very concerned about AI being used to create false or misleading pictures, information, and videos. Nine in 10 are at least somewhat concerned about it.",
      "And though a slim majority feel they can tell the difference between AI- and human-produced things at least somewhat well, few say they can do so very well. Among people who don't use AI themselves \u2014 a category most Americans are in \u2014 most don't feel they can distinguish even somewhat well.",
      "Public understanding and personal use of AI",
      "Two-thirds feel they have a good understanding of AI. That matches the levels seen in our 1999 polling on the internet, and we see similar demographic breaks now as we did then. Americans today are much likelier to say their understanding is somewhat good than very good, suggesting room for it to grow in the coming years.",
      "There are stark divides in AI understanding and use by age. Eight in 10 Americans under the age of 45 feel they have a good understanding, while that number falls to only about half of Americans 65 and older. College degree holders report higher levels of than other Americans, as do men relative to women. Men are also more positive than women on AI's economic impact.",
      "Most don't feel it's necessary to use AI these days to keep up with the times. Four in 10 say they personally use AI, and those who do are likelier to say it's for personal use than for work. The few who use it mostly for work report greater understanding of AI and tend to feel it will make jobs in their field easier to do.",
      "The share who say people must use AI to keep up is close to the four in 10 who said so about the internet in 1999. And as was the case back then, early adopters skew young and male. And younger people are more likely to say they use AI for work purposes.",
      "Six in 10 say artificial intelligence will have a bigger effect on society than the internet did. That is significant, as the internet itself was seen as bringing about big change in its early years. In 1999, Gallup polling found that most Americans felt it was going to change society more than the introduction of the telephone and television.",

      "The 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but automakers won't be subject to the additional 25% import duty on imported steel and aluminum. Reimbursements will also be given to automakers who have already paid the double tariffs, the administration said.",

      "\"We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country, and that's according to many, many people,\" Mr. Trump said to kick off his speech at Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan. \"This is the best, they say, 100-day start of any president in history, and everyone is saying it. We've just gotten started. You haven't even seen anything yet.\"",
      "The president chose to give his speech in the heart of the auto industry, as he hopes the tariffs he's imposing on imports from other countries will bring auto companies and other manufacturers back to the U.S., despite economists' warnings that the president's policies will increase prices. On Tuesday, the president signed executive orders to provide some relief from the 25% tariffs he's imposing on imported foreign cars and parts.",
      "As the president's approval numbers have slipped since his inauguration, Mr. Trump particularly homed in on his administration's border enforcement policies. Immigration continues to be one of the president's strongest issues in polling.",
      "\"There's never been such a difference in anything as the difference between the border today and the border what it was just six months ago, so I want to say congratulations, America, it's about time,\" he said.",
      "As the Trump administration faces a slew of lawsuits over its mass deportations and other immigration policies, the president said, \"the courts are giving us a hard time.\" Mr. Trump said his administration has significantly increased arrests of \"known and suspected terrorists,\" appearing to reference suspected gang members.",
      "\"We tried to get it higher, we tried to get it higher, but the courts are giving us a hard time, can you believe?\" Mr. Trump said. \"You know, I won on the basis of, I think, the number one thing was on illegal immigration, the border. \u2026 I think that was the number one thing, and now the courts are trying to say that you know, that doesn't matter. I don't think it's going to be allowed to stand.\"",

They're coming from all over to see your president. They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. And you know, we'll make deals, but we don't have to.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also touted slower inflation, but criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying he's \"not really doing a good job.\" The Fed has drawn Mr. Trump's ire for declining to speed up interest rate cuts so far this year, which could boost economic growth at the cost of higher inflation. Powell has also warned Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs could push up consumer prices and harm the economy.",

      "Mr. Trump also touted his administration's work on hot-button social issues.",
      "\"I ended all of the lawless so-called diversity, equity and inclusion bulls***, all across the federal government and the private sector,\" the president claimed. \"And I made it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.

Those endeavors have not gone unopposed, prompting scores of lawsuits filed by ousted government employees, migrants fighting their deportation and business owners who argue the president's tariffs are unlawful.",
      "\"[I]nflation has cooled, consumer prices dropped month-over-month for the first time in three years, and gas prices are lower across the country,\" the White House said in announcing the speech, and it went on to praise the Department of Government Efficiency for rooting out \"waste, fraud, and abuse across the executive branch\" and canceling \"numerous discriminatory DEI contracts.\"",
      "DOGE's work continues apace, with billionaire Elon Musk unofficially guiding efforts to downsize government. So far, however, DOGE's cuts aren't anywhere close to approaching the $2 trillion Musk initially said he'd slash from annual spending. Those efforts have also landed the federal government in multiple courtrooms over the firings, downsizing and elimination of government-funded programs.",
      "The Trump administration claims it has done more to secure the border in the president's first 100 days in office than any other president in history. Illegal border crossings\u00a0have reached\u00a0lows not seen in decades, and the administration has been working to deport migrants accused or convicted of violent crimes and drug-related offenses. But Mr. Trump's decision to invoke wartime authorities to send migrants to an El Salvador prison without due process has resulted in lawsuits, as has the president's efforts to end\u00a0birthright citizenship.",
      "The 100-day mark comes as the Trump administration is hashing out trade negotiations with countries across the world after Mr. Trump levied nearly worldwide tariffs on foreign imports, tariffs that most economists say will make goods more expensive and worsen economic prospects. Mr. Trump claimed in an interview with TIME that he's reached 200 trade deals with other countries since April 2, but declined to name any of the countries.

      "In its two-page order, the state Supreme Court said it was acting on its own initiative and not responding to a request from anyone. Liberal justices control the court 4-3.",

      "Dugan is accused of escorting the man and his lawyer from her court through the jury door last week after learning that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were in the building and seeking his arrest.",
      "Court documents suggest Dugan was alerted to the agents' presence by her clerk, who was informed by an attorney that they appeared to be in the hallway.",
      "An FBI affidavit says Dugan was \"visibly angry\" over the agents' arrival and called the situation \"absurd\" before leaving the bench and retreating to her chambers. It says she and another judge later approached members of the arrest team inside the courthouse with what witnesses described as a \"confrontational, angry demeanor.\"",
      "After a back-and-forth with officers over the warrant for Flores-Ruiz, she demanded they speak with the chief judge and led them away from the courtroom, the affidavit says.",
      "After directing the agents to the chief judge's office, investigators say, Dugan returned to the courtroom and was heard saying words to the effect of \"wait, come with me\" before ushering Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer through the jury door into a nonpublic area.",
      "The action was unusual, the affidavit says, because \"only deputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies used the back jury door. Defense attorneys and defendants who were not in custody never used the jury door.\"",
      "Dugan's arrests has sparked outrage among Democrats, who have accused the Trump administration of trying to chill the judiciary. Demonstrators gathered outside the FBI's Milwaukee field office Saturday to protest her arrest.",

    "story": [
      "UPS on Tuesday announced it is planning to cut 20,000 jobs this year, part of a cost-cutting effort that's linked to the delivery giant's decision to deliver fewer packages from Amazon, its biggest customer.",
      "The shipping company, which operates in over 200 countries, currently has around 490,000 employees. The layoffs will impact slightly over 4% of its workforce. This follows an announcement from UPS last year that it would cut 12,000 positions.",
      "The move is part of the company's plan to consolidate UPS's facilities and workforce. Along with the job cuts, the company announced it will also close 73 of its buildings by the end of June 2025 and said that it may target additional buildings for closure.",
      "\"These actions will enable us to expand our U.S. Domestic operating margin and increase profitability,\" Brian Dykes, the chief financial officer of UPS said during an earnings call on Tuesday morning.",
      "In a Tuesday regulatory filing, UPS said the cuts are in \"connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.\" The company, which announced $21.5 billion in revenue for this past quarter, expects to save $3.5 billion this year as a result of its consolidation plan.",

      "\"Strong\" relationship with Amazon",
      "The company in January\u00a0said it had reached an agreement with Amazon to decrease its delivery volume by more than 50% in the second half of 2026.",
      "\"The reduction of package volume from Amazon is something UPS chose to do as we focus on revenue quality, and increase domestic operating margin and profitability,\" a UPS spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",

      "\"Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision,\" said Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson. \"We'll continue to partner with them and many other carriers to serve our customers.\"",

The Trump administration has introduced sweeping new tariffs in recent months that have already began to impact the flow of goods in and out of the country, and around the world.",
      "UPS handles roughly 400,000 imported parcels each day, or roughly 2% of the packages they move on a daily basis. Still, the company could be impacted if the trade war between China and the U.S. continues.",
      "\"From a revenue perspective, last year, revenue on our China to U.S. trade lanes represented 11% of our total international revenue,\" said CEO Carol Tom\u00e9 said during Tuesday's earning call. \"Our China to U.S. trade lines are our most profitable trade lines.\"",

    "summary": "A new proposal from Republican lawmakers would eliminate the popular SAVE repayment plan, which helped lower costs for millions.",
    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments.",
      "The proposal, which was released by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan.",
      "The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major\u00a0 repayment program that sparked a lawsuit from Republican states last year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue.",
      "The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement.",
      "The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt.",
      "The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know.",
      "How could income-based repayment plans change?",
      "For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs.",
      "SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it was paused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\"",
      "Under the Republican proposal, the four existing\u00a0income-based plans would be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount.",
      "Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years.",
      "\"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in an April 28 letter to Republican lawmakers.",
      "What other repayment plans would be available?",
      "The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed.",
      "For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposed\u00a0bill.",
      "How could Pell grants change?",
      "Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program \u2014 geared to low- and middle-income students \u2014 would face new limits.",
      "For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants.",
      "The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants.",
      "What other changes could occur?",
      "The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school.",
      "The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount \u2014 $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently \u2014 before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college.",
      "The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 17:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A new study from researchers at the Yale School of Public Health found major disparities in life expectancy between individual U.S. states.",
    "story": [
      "In the United States, how long a person lives\u00a0can vary substantially depending on where in the country they reside.",
      "Comparing the life expectancy of people born from 1900 to 2000, a study published Monday found that in many southern states, life expectancy changed very little, especially for women. But in several states in the Northeast and West, as well as in Washington, D.C., it improved significantly.",
      "Ranked among the worst states for longevity improvements over the last century, West Virginia's life expectancy for women born in 2000 rose to just 75.3 years, one year longer than its life expectancy for women born in 1900, according to the study. The state's life expectancy for men born in 2000 increased by about 9 years compared to those born in 1900.",
      "By comparison, the study showed the life expectancy for women born in New York in 2000 is about 92 years, roughly two decades longer than for those born in 1900. And men born in New York in 2000 have a life expectancy of about 88 years, almost 28 years longer than those born in 1900.",
      "Life expectancy nationwide increased far more for men from 1900 to 2000 than it did for women, a pattern that held true in a number of individual states. Overall, women's life expectancy by birth cohort grew from 73.8 to 84.1 years, while men's rose from 62.8 to 80.3 years.",
      "The study also found that longevity for men typically plateaued around 1950. Researchers said life expectancy increased by less than 2 years for men in many states since 1950.",
      "Researchers at the Yale School of Public Health conducted the study, and their findings were published in the journal JAMA Network Open. The results analyzed 179 million deaths around the U.S., including the deaths of 77 million women and 102 million men.",
      "The study differs from previous ones by looking at life expectancy by birth cohort, rather than by just calendar years, the authors say.",
      "\"Prior studies have considered mortality and disease from the perspective of calendar year or period but have not provided summaries for individuals by birth cohorts,\" they wrote. \"The cohort trends can assess the outcomes of policy changes that have more impact on individuals of a particular age and impact health thereafter.\"",
      "Best and worst states for life expectancy",
      "For women, the study found that life expectancy changed very little for those born in 1900 and those born in 2000 in five states: West Virginia, up from 74.3 to 75.3; Oklahoma, which saw a decrease from 76.7 to 76; Kentucky, up from 74.9 to 76.5; Mississippi, up from 73.2 to 76.6; and Arkansas, where it rose from 75.7 to 76.6.",
      "Ted Holford, a research scientist in biostatistics who co-authored the study, told CBS News the minimal changes in women's longevity found in certain regions were unexpected.",
      "\"For some of those states in the Northeast and the West, there's been quite a lot of change, which one would expect, given all of the changes in medical practices and health care over the 20th century,\" Holford said. \"But what was surprising to me is how little it changed, especially for women, in some of those southern states. Some of them basically didn't change at all.\"",
      "For men, Mississippi, West Virginia, Alabama, Louisiana and Tennessee saw the lowest changes in life expectancy compared with the rest of the country. In each, men born in 1900 had a life expectancy of between 61.5 and 63.7 years, while those born in 2000 have a life expectancy between 71.8 and 73.4 years. Much of the longevity increases for men in those states happened before 1950, with little improvement from then onward, Holford said.",
      "Like the lowest-ranking states, those with the highest life expectancy, and the most significant jumps in longevity over the last century, overlapped between women and men.",
      "For women, the study found life expectancy rates were highest and most improved for those born in Washington, D.C., New York, California, Massachusetts and Hawaii. New York, California, Washington, D.C., Massachusetts and Washington state topped the list for men.",
      "Why do people live longer in some states and not others?",
      "Authors of the study attributed the country's overall decrease in mortality rates to national improvements in sanitation, tobacco policies and health care, specifically calling out the progress made in terms of preventing cardiovascular disease, cancer and other illnesses since 1900. They cited variations in state public health policies between individual states to potentially explain the regional discrepancies indicated in the study, which also mentioned widening longevity gaps from the 1980s onward.",
      "\"These are undoubtedly shaped by state-level policies: states with progressive public health policies were more likely to experience increases in life expectancy than states without such policies,\" the authors wrote, adding that \"differences in mortality rates are also observed even at more granular levels by county.\"",
      "Holford acknowledged that \"a complex array of things\" has contributed to the ways in which life expectancy has changed in some states and not others, with variations in statewide tobacco regulations, vaccine policies and wealth to support better health care being a few of them. As this study grew out of a larger project that Holford worked on, developing population models for lung cancer, he used the evolving laws in some states to clamp down on cigarette smoking in some states versus others as one example of discrepancies that could feed into state-by-state differences in life expectancy.",
      "\"Some of the states have been more aggressive about trying to control tobacco use, introducing things like taxes on cigarettes and having clean air laws,\" Holford told CBS News. \"But some of these southern states, they've done very little. Some of them haven't instituted any efforts [to curb tobacco use].\"",
      "Socioeconomic factors play a significant role in the differences between health environments by state, Holford and his co-authors noted, echoing findings of other reports on longevity in the U.S. Last year, a study that examined death records from 2000 to 2021 pinpointed large disparities in life expectancy based on location, as well as race and ethnicity.",
      "Accounting for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors of that study found that historically marginalized populations, including Black and Indigenous Americans, experienced disproportionately high mortality rates and \"horrific losses in life expectancy\" compared with other groups.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth vowed to bring transparency to the American people.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0 Forty-five days into a U.S. air campaign against Iranian-backed Houthis, American forces have hit more than 1,000 targets in Yemen. Yet, despite promises from Trump administration officials to run \"the most transparent Defense Department in history,\" the Pentagon has held just one formal briefing in the first 100 days of President Trump's second term.",
      "\"In line with the secretary's vision to make this the most transparent Department of Defense in history, I gave you my personal commitment to make these briefings more routine,\" said top Pentagon public affairs aide Sean Parnell on March 17, during the only formal briefing conducted so far.",
      "During the same period, the White House and State Department have held 18 and 13 briefings, respectively, as of April 28.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the Pentagon had 34 on-camera briefings in its first 100 days while Biden's White House and State Department held 61 and 34 briefings, respectively. During the first 100 days of Mr. Trump's first term, reporters received five on-camera briefings from the Defense Department.",
      "The Pentagon has a long history of briefing the media about military operations. Until his departure in 1968, Barry Zorthian would climb to the rooftop of Saigon's Rex Hotel to give reporters the Pentagon's official version of the Vietnam War. The briefings were branded the \"Five O'Clock Follies\" by skeptical reporters, but even so, the dialogue between spokesperson and journalist provided a critical stream of information about what the government was doing on behalf of American citizens.",
      "The tradition stretched across wars \u2014 from Desert Storm in 1991 to the 1999 Kosovo air campaign \u2014\u00a0 and even during the Biden administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Pentagon continued to brief the press regularly.",
      "Retired Rear Adm. T. McCreary, who ran the Navy's public affairs office as the chief of naval information from 2003 to 2006, told CBS News there are three reasons to hold news briefings: To get your story out first, so the public reacts to you; second, to stop the spread of the enemy putting out disinformation to spin the story; and third, to inform the taxpayers what the Pentagon, which has the largest discretionary budget of any department, is doing with its money.",
      "\"Every time the Pentagon and the [Defense Department] establishments start being less forthcoming with information, it erodes the trust and transparency that was built up over years to where the faith and the establishment sometimes starts getting questioned,\" McCreary said.",
      "The Office of the Secretary of Defense's Principles of Information details the Pentagon's guidelines for public affairs. Included is the promise to \"make available timely and accurate information so that the public, the Congress, and the news media may assess and understand the facts about national security and defense strategy.\"",
      "The single on-camera briefing the Pentagon held 43 days ago took place in the days after U.S. Central Command launched the ongoing campaign against the Houthis. Parnell, the chief spokesperson, and the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff Lt. Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich answered questions on the operation.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has held news conferences and short question and answer sessions with a small group of reporters while traveling but has not yet conducted an on-camera briefing in the Pentagon Briefing Room, which accommodates about 60 reporters. He has, however, used the briefing room on at least four separate occasions as a backdrop for live interviews with Fox News.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. Central Command issued a press release boasting of hundreds of enemy fighters killed and dozens of command and storage centers destroyed under Operation Rough Rider. The targets, officials said, included advanced missiles, drones, and vessels used in Houthi attacks on commercial shipping lanes\u2014claims offered with little public scrutiny and even fewer questions answered as the total cost of the campaign nears $1 billion, CNN reported.",
      "CBS News reached out to the Pentagon and U.S. Central Command with questions on Monday, but neither one has responded.",
      "Soon after the campaign against the Houthis began, Hegseth was embroiled in controversy over sensitive details he shared over Signal on March 15 ahead of the initial strikes.",
      "Hegseth has denied sending any classified information, but over a month later, his use of Signal is still under scrutiny, following the revelation that he shared similar updates in a second chat that included his wife, brother and personal attorney.",
      "In that same month, five officials in Hegseth's inner circle have either been fired or left their positions, including John Ullyot, who briefly served as Pentagon Press Secretary and wrote an op-ed after his departure claiming there is \"total chaos\" at the Pentagon.",
      "Hegseth and Parnell, the chief spokesperson, have both denied these claims and have on social media blamed the stories on the media and disgruntled employees, but they have not briefed journalists to address questions.",
      "\"I think the administration would like to talk about something besides Signal, but the problem is they keep screwing it up,\" a former senior defense official told CBS News. \"You know the first thing about being in a bad news cycle is to stop creating news.\"",
      "During the Biden administration, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in the aftermath of his hospitalization scandal, took questions from the podium in the Pentagon press briefing room. For about 40 minutes, he answered questions and apologized for not disclosing his hospitalization and cancer diagnosis.",
      "\"It is hard to overstate the importance of having the Pentagon hold regular press briefings,\" said Howard Altman, president of the Military Reporters and Editors association in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"The American public has a right to know how and why taxpayer dollars are spent, how those in uniform are faring and, within the boundaries of operational security, the dangers our troops and nation face\u2026this is not a partisan issue,\" he said. \"It is an American one. A well-informed public is a cornerstone of our democracy.\"",
      "Parnell has been going to X to provide weekly situation reports \u2014 or sitreps \u2014 where he talks straight to the camera about Pentagon updates as part of the administration's promise of transparency. The videos released each week do not provide the opportunity for the media to ask questions.",
      "Instead of regular press engagements, the Pentagon in February created DOD Rapid Response, a social media account on X. The account's bio states it is \"Supporting The Mission of SecDef [Hegseth] And Fighting Against Fake News!\"",
      "The account commonly attacks news publications and\u00a0 posts comments criticizing reporting about Hegseth and the Defense Department. The X account has omitted context from its statements, touting an increase in U.S. military recruiting numbers between February 2024 through February 2025, even though much of the credit for improved recruitment numbers belongs to Biden administration, as CBS News' Confirmed team found.",
      "The account also posted misleading statements about the Signal chat scandal reported by The Atlantic. The account is overseen by conservative podcaster and Army veteran Graham Allen, who is now the Pentagon's digital media director.",
      "\"Holding your policies up to the light of media scrutiny is a good, healthy thing,\" a second former senior defense official said. \"Over time, that scrutiny is very good for the policymaking process because reporters are going to think of things, and they're going to approach the way to ask questions in ways that the policy thinkers and the policy makers may not have done.\"",

      "The e-commerce giant plans to display new tariff costs next to products' prices, political news site Punchbowl\u00a0reported earlier Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. The move would provide shoppers with clarity into the cost of the new levies on imported goods.",
      "\"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\" Leavitt said during a press briefing Tuesday.",
      "However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul was introduced late last year by the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein.",
      "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" said Tim Doyle, an Amazon spokesperson.",

      "The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a 90-day pause that began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs.",
      "The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers.",

      "At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "When former Idaho State Trooper Dan Howard called 911 from his home in Athol, Idaho, on the night of Feb. 2, 2021, he was crying so much that it was hard to understand what he was saying.",
      "\"My wife ... she shot herself,\" Dan Howard told the operator. \"She's in the bathtub dead ... I go upstairs and she's dead. She's dead ... she's gray, she has no pulse, nothing ... she's cold.\"",
      "Dan Howard later told authorities that he had been downstairs and heard something hitting the floor upstairs. Dan Howard said that when he went upstairs over an hour later, he found his wife of 26 years, Kendy Howard, in a bathtub filled with water with a gunshot wound to her head.",
      "The case \u2014 starting from the hours after Kendy's death to a surprising final twist \u2014 is investigated by \"48 Hours\" and correspondent Peter Van Sant in \"The Bathtub Murder of Kendy Howard.\"\u00a0An encore of the broadcast airs Saturday, May 3 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Kootenai County Sheriff's Deputy Miranda Thomas was one of the first responders to arrive at the Howards' home that night. Thomas later described how Dan Howard was \"screaming, yelling, asking us for help ... sobbing, gagging, just overall kind of freaking out.\"",
      "Also on the scene that night was Kootenai County Sheriff's Detective Jerry Northrup. Northrup confirmed the 911 call was dispatched as a suicide, but recounts that it did not take long for his team to grow suspicious.",
      "\"For a woman to shoot herself in the tub, nude, is unusual,\" said Northrup. \"It doesn't mean it can't happen \u2014 it just means that it's unusual.\"",
      "There was also other evidence at the scene that stuck out to investigators. According to Northrup, there was broken glass found in the primary bedroom, and Kendy Howard's clothing thrown on the floor. There were wet towels behind the bathroom door, and when investigators first arrived at the scene, they reported that the water in the tub was still warm to the touch. Thomas noticed a packed duffle bag filled with women's clothing lay at the bottom of the stairs, and that the shirt Dan Howard was wearing seemed to have fresh deodorant stains.",
      "One of the more intriguing clues, say investigators, was a load of laundry mid-cycle in the dryer. Thomas took note: \"A washer or dryer doesn't run for very long, 45 minutes, maybe an hour, so when was this washer and dryer started?\"",
      "Northrup had the same thought and recorded the time left on the dryer cycle: six minutes. He told Van Sant how he pulled up the cycle running times from the manufacturer's website and compared the information against the time at which the 911 call was placed.",
      "Northrup determined that the dryer cycle would have started at 10:42 p.m. and the 911 call came in at 10:43 p.m. Meaning, says Northrup, Howard started the laundry cycle about a minute before calling 911. But why?",
      "Investigators continued digging, and after reviewing the evidence with medical and scientific experts, came up with a theory as to how Dan Howard could have killed his wife.",
      "Dan Howard was arrested in April 2023, and in March 2024, went on trial for the murder of his wife.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday is set to hear arguments in a high-profile dispute over efforts in Oklahoma to create an online Catholic charter school, a case that could open the door to public dollars flowing directly to religious schools.",
      "A ruling in favor of the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, could lead to the country's first religious charter school and upend laws in 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the federal charter school program, all of which require charter schools to be nonsectarian, Oklahoma's Republican attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has warned.",
      "\"This would really be the first time that the Supreme Court sanctions, if it rules in favor of the charter school, the direct flow of funds from the government and financial support from the government to a religious entity for religious activities,\" said Jessie Hill, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University who focuses on the law and religion.",
      "St. Isidore, she said, is asking the state to \"quite literally establish a religious school. It's essentially making a religious school, creating an affiliation between the religious entity and the state that we haven't seen before.\"",
      "A decision follow the Supreme Court's three\u00a0rulings in recent years that were in favor of religious plaintiffs, which all allowed public funds to be used for religious institutions. But backers of St. Isidore argue that its position is simply an application of those decisions and would not create any new principles.",
      "\"The unifying thread is the idea that once the government decides to open up a program and to distribute benefits or to contract with people, it can't single out religious people or institutions for special disadvantage,\" said Richard Garnett, a professor at Notre Dame Law School who directs its Program on Church, State and Society.",
      "The formation of a Catholic charter school",
      "Oklahoma has offered charter schools within its public education system since 1999 and, like 44 other states and the federal charter school program, requires the institutions to be \"nonsectarian in its programs, admission policies, employment practices, and all other operations.\" The state has at least 30 charter schools that serve more than 50,000 students, and they received $314 million from the state and $69 million in federal funds in the 2022 to 2023 school year, according to a 2023 report from the Oklahoma State Department of Education.",
      "In January 2023, the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa formed the St. Isidore of Seville Virtual Charter School Inc. for the purpose of establishing and operating St. Isidore as a Catholic school, according to court records. That May, St. Isidore applied to the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board to establish it as a virtual charter school that \"fully embraces the teachings of the Catholic Church's Magisterium\" and \"fully incorporates these [teachings] into every aspect of the school.\"",
      "The school estimated initial enrollment of 500 students and projected it would receive roughly $2.7 million in state funding for its first year of operation, according to court documents.",
      "Ahead of a vote by the board, Drummond warned against approval of St. Isidore's application, and said an earlier analysis from his predecessor supporting the school could be \"used as a basis for taxpayer-funded religious schools, which is exactly what [St. Isidore] seeks to become.\"",
      "Drummond also warned that approving St. Isidore's application to become a charter school \"will create a slippery slope.\"",
      "\"I doubt most Oklahomans would want their tax dollars to fund a religious school whose tenets are diametrically opposed to their own faith,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approval of a charter school by one faith will compel the approval of charter schools by all faiths, including even those most Oklahomans would consider reprehensible and unworthy of public funding.\"",
      "Still, the charter school board voted 3-2 to approve St. Isidore's application, and in October 2023, it and the school entered in a contract establishing St. Isidore's as a charter school.",
      "That month, Drummond sued the board directly in the Oklahoma Supreme Court and asked it to rescind the charter contract and declare St. Isidore's establishment as a charter school unlawful.",
      "The attorney general prevailed before the state's highest court, which ruled that because St. Isidore's is a public charter school, it violated the state's requirement that those entities be nonreligious, as well as the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, in part because it would \"permit state spending in direct support of the religious curriculum and activities within St. Isidore.\"",
      "\"The state will be directly funding a religious school and encouraging students to attend it,\" the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which split 6-2, found.",
      "The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore's both asked the Supreme Court to review the decision, and it agreed to do so in January.",
      "A \"major breach\" in the wall",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in a string of recent decisions sided with religious families and institutions that challenged state-funded programs for excluding religious beneficiaries as violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.",
      "In 2017, the court said that Missouri violated the free exercise right of Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center when it denied it grant funding to resurface its playground. Then, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Montana could not exclude religious schools from a program providing tax credits to people who donate to scholarships for private-school students. Most recently, in 2022, the Supreme Court said Maine cannot limit a tuition assistance program to nonsectarian schools.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Drummond argued that the justices have drawn a clear line through those decisions: If the state offers tuition assistance that parents can direct to the school of their choosing, it cannot exclude religious private schools. But when it comes to public schools, he said, states can provide a secular education.",
      "Drummond said the Supreme Court has never held that the Constitution's Establishment Clause allows \"direct aid for religious instruction in public schools,\" and added that creating and funding a religious public school would violate that provision of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Religious education is an invaluable benefit for millions of Americans who choose it,\" Drummond wrote. \"But our Constitution has never required the creation of religious public schools. There is no basis to change that now.\"",
      "He warned that if the Supreme Court rules for St. Isidore, \"state funds will pour into religious public charter schools just as they do traditional public schools,\" and the firewall between public funds flowing to a school because of private choice versus a direct subsidy would be damaged.",
      "\"A ruling for petitioners would eliminate the buffer this court has long enforced between religious instruction and public schools \u2014 including in areas where charter schools are the only or default public-school option,\" Drummond argued, noting that the issue is direct aid.",
      "A crucial question in the court fight is whether Oklahoma's charter schools are public schools.",
      "Drummond says they are, because the state's charter schools have to comply with anti-discrimination laws; they are free, open to all students, created and funded by the state, and are subject to government regulation and oversight regarding curriculum, testing and other issues. And because charter schools are public schools, the attorney general said they are government entities.",
      "But lawyers for the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board and St. Isidore disagree. Backing them in the case are Oklahoma's GOP governor, Kevin Stitt, and the state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters.",
      "The board and school said St. Isidore is a privately operated school providing free publicly funded education through a contract with the state, and the Free Exercise Clause protects its right to participate in the charter school program.",
      "\"The state did not design the school. It did not create or encourage St. Isidore's religious character. It did not appoint any member of St. Isidore's board. It did not instruct the school to offer an education in the Catholic tradition. And it will not hire or supervise the school's teachers and administrators,\" lawyers for St. Isidore wrote in a filing. \"",
      "The restrictions in state law, lawyers said, amount to unconstitutional religious discrimination because Oklahoma is excluding religious observers from otherwise available public benefits and programs. And because the state's charter school program is neutrally administered, the Establishment Clause doesn't prevent public dollars from flowing to religious schools.",
      "\"This is particularly true when private choice directs government dollars to religious schools,\" they said.",
      "Garnett, of Notre Dame Law School, said that public money would only go to St. Isidore if a parent made the choice to send their child to the virtual school.",
      "\"If the court thinks that what Oklahoma has done is create a program that private entities are eligible to participate in, then it's straightforward to say once they do that, they can't discriminate on the basis of religion,\" he said.",
      "But professor Hill, like Drummond, said charter schools are public schools, and warned there's always been a line where the Supreme Court did not allow the direct flow of government funds to religious schools for religious instruction. She said the case is part of a progression that began with the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling and comes as traditional public schools are being starved of resources in many states.",
      "\"The agenda has been to require, not just allow, direct government funding of religious schools in particular,\" she said. \"Vouchers are one thing, but I do think it's a major breach in the wall of separation if the charter school wins.\"",
      "Just eight justices will hear arguments in the case, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett has recused herself. Though she did not provide a reason for her stepping aside, it may be because the Notre Dame Law School's Religious Liberty Clinic is representing St. Isidore.",
      "Barrett taught at Notre Dame before she was appointed to the federal bench and was an adjunct professor at the law school in 2023, according to her most recent financial disclosure report. Barrett is also close friends with Nicole Stelle Garnett, an associate dean at Notre Dame Law School who authored a paper that suggested that as a result of a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, states with charter schools must permit religious charter schools or risk violating the Free Exercise Clause.",
      "Because of Barrett's recusal, the Supreme Court could deadlock 4-4. That result would leave in place the ruling from the Oklahoma Supreme Court that found the contract establishing St. Isidore's as a Catholic public charter school was a violation of state and federal law.",
      "A decision is expected by the end of June or early July.",

The majority of the infections have been reported in an outbreak in West Texas that has led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The number of cases in Texas alone has grown to more than\u00a0660, while cases nationwide topped 880, with infections confirmed in at least 29 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",

      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",

      "The highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",

      "\"Yesterday I played 18 holes. I'm going to play 18 holes in my league today, and if I feel okay, I'll play 18 holes tomorrow,\" said Richards recently.",
      "The former professional tennis player and ophthalmologist made headlines in the 1970s, when after transitioning to female she sued and won the right to play in the U.S. Open. During her half-decade pro career, Richards peaked at 20th in the world and in 1977 made the U.S. open finals in doubles, where she lost to a pair that included tennis legend Martina Navratilova.",
      "Half a century later, her views have evolved \u2014 she believes transgender women who transition after puberty should not compete in women's sports \u2014 but she's aghast at broader restrictions on transgender rights during the Trump administration's first 100 days.",
      "The State Department has halted the practice of issuing passports with \"X\" gender markers. The Office of Personnel Management directed agency heads to strip \"gender ideology\" from websites, contracts and emails. An executive order calls on the federal government \"to rescind all funds from educational programs\" that allow transgender girls and women to compete. Another order restricts access to gender-affirming care\u00a0for youth. The Department of Defense has reinstated President Trump's first term transgender military ban, and transgender federal inmates are now regarded by their sex at birth. The changes are the subject of ongoing lawsuits.",
      "First and foremost on Richards' mind: the Navy veteran believes transgender Americans should be able to serve openly in the military.",
      "\"That's terrible. You know, I can only think of myself because I was in the Navy when nobody knew that I was a transgender. I hadn't had surgery yet, but it was still me,\" said Richards, who won the All-Navy tennis championship while serving. \"That goes a long way back, but I'm still representative of the same ilk even though they didn't know it at the time.\"",
      "Richards is the subject of a forthcoming book, tentatively titled \"Finding Ren\u00e9e,\" by former Sports Illustrated editor Julie Kliegman. Richards believes the fierce debate over transgender athletes has fueled a \"jump\u2026from the sports to the military, to the education, to the bathrooms, to the passports, to the existence, to the teaching of any kind of gender.\"",
      "It's a trend that has played out in state legislatures, before and during the current Trump administration, according to Logan Casey, the director of policy research at the nonprofit Movement Advancement Project, which tracks state laws and executive orders regulating gender.",
      "Casey said state-level bans on sports prior to the current Trump administration \"laid the groundwork for all of the anti-transgender and anti-LGBTQ attacks more broadly.\"",
      "\"It sort of put sports as a foot in the door, and a framework, for how many people who had not previously thought about transgender people very much \u2014 let alone in the context of policy and law \u2014 are now thinking about it and framing it,\" said Casey, who noted the vast majority of state legislation targeting LGBTQ rights fails to become law.",
      "Ash Lazarus Orr, a spokesperson for Advocates for Trans Equality, said the language of Mr. Trump's executive orders bore similarities to orders and legislation coming out of state capitals.",
      "\"It signals back to states that, yes, this is a priority. You should continue to do this, and in fact do this and other attacks,\" said Orr, who is also the title plaintiff in a lawsuit over the Trump administration's policy requiring U.S. passports to reflect sex assigned at birth. \"While we were seeing attacks on the trans community escalating at a state level under the Biden administration, what we are seeing now under the Trump administration is absolutely an escalation.\"",
      "Former Olympic swimmer Nancy Hogshead, a Democrat who founded the nonprofit advocacy group Champion Women, believes the party is suffering from self-inflicted wounds.",
      "Hogshead, who supports efforts to align participation in sports with gender at birth, said Trump and Republicans have found a galvanizing issue.",
      "\"It is a winner for them. It is a winner for Republicans,\" Hogshead said. \"Fifty percent of all girls play sports. That is a meat and potatoes issue for them. It's not a fringe issue.\"",
      "Richards believes Trump has a similar view. She said, as an ophthalmologist, she treated one of his sisters and has met Mr. Trump once.",
      "\"He knows I'm not an ogre,\" she said. \"He sees, and his advisors advise him, that his popularity rests with the small group of people that hate the idea of transgender, period.\"",
      "Richards, whose professional tennis career began in 1977 when she was more than 40 years old, largely agrees with Hogshead. In April 2024, she provided the Women's Tennis Association with a position paper on participation of transgender women in sports, and this year allowed Sports Illustrated to publish it. In the paper, Richards concluded that people who have undergone male puberty should be ineligible to compete against biological females.",
      "Richards's paper included reflections on her time playing both as an amateur and professionally, analysis of \"the current literature on the subject,\" citing her decades as a doctor, and policy recommendations.",
      "It also touched on golf.",
      "\"My lifetime in sports is still ongoing,\" she wrote. \"I have been a member of the ladies' golf league at the public/private club near my home for the past 20 years.\"",
      "Richards spoke to CBS News on opening day last week. She said, despite politics, the women in her league still welcome her competition.",
      "\"Not only welcome and accepted, but if I didn't show up, they would have a cemetery ceremony, believe me,\" Richards said.",
      "Are there a lot of 90-year-olds there, still hitting the links?",
      "\"Yeah, me. Amongst the men and the women, I'm the only one,\" Richards said, adding that she guesses the average age at the club is 60. \"I play the forward tee, but I don't play any gold tees that are in front of that \u2014 and I hit the ball as well as they do, too.\"",

      "A Pittsburgh funeral home director is facing charges after prosecutors said he threw out the bodies of thousands of pets and gave owners the ashes of other animals.",
      "Seventy-year-old Patrick Vereb, the owner of Vereb Funeral Home and Eternity Pet Memorial, is accused of stealing more than $650,000 from over 6,500 customers who paid for pet burial and cremation services between 2021 and 2024, the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General announced on Monday.",
      "Funeral director accused of throwing pets in landfill",
      "Through about 20 veterinary practices and businesses, Vereb collected hundreds of thousands of dollars from pet owners who were promised a private cremation for their pet, prosecutors said.",
      "But instead of performing the services, investigators said Vereb threw many of the pets out at a landfill, giving customers the ashes of other unknown animals.",
      "\"This case is disturbing, and will cause devastation and heartache for many Pennsylvanians,\" Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday  said in a press release. \"Our pets are members of our families, and this defendant betrayed and agonized pet owners who entrusted him to provide dignified services for their beloved cats and dogs. I commend our investigative team for a comprehensive review of voluminous records which uncovered this long-running pattern of theft and deception.\"",
      "Whistleblower describes how pet ashes were handled",
      "Tiffany Mantzouridis told KDKA-TV\u00a0there were several red flags when she was an intern at Vereb Funeral Home. She said the pets' bodies were kept in garbage bags on top of freezers and there were discrepancies in recordkeeping.",
      "\"He would take the ashes back from the crematory, and they come back in a big bag with plastic bags with twist ties on them that have the metal tag twisted onto them. And then, for some unknown reason, would take that bag into his apartment, close the door, mess around with the ashes, and they would all come back and zip lock baggies with no tags,\" said Mantzouridis.",
      "A woman whose cat was cremated through Vereb's business said she has a zip-close bag of ashes, but there's no crematory tag, leaving her to wonder whose remains she actually has. She called the allegations \"disturbing.\"",
      "Who are the victims?",
      "The state has\u00a0launched a website\u00a0that potential victims are encouraged to use. In addition to vets, prosecutors said Vereb also found victims through walk-in and direct-pay clients of Eternity Pet Memorial. The attorney general's office says it has identified victims from Allegheny, Armstrong, Washington and Westmoreland counties.",
      "The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office is asking potential victims, who had their pet cremated between 2021 and 2024, to\u00a0fill out a form online.According to the office's website, the following vets and businesses were impacted: Affordable Care, All About Pets, Always Compassionate, Imperial Animal Hospital, Kapr Funeral Home, Kiski Valley Animal Clinic, K-Vet, Loyalhanna Animal Hospital, Meadowlands, Plum Animal Hospital, River Valley, Dr. Mary Ann Bender, Pet Haven Pet Cemetery, Frankie's Friends, Sable Kennels, Little Creek Farm, Golden Mile Animal Clinic, Greengate Animal Clinic, Salem Animal Hospital and Monongahela Animal Hospital.",
      "Vereb is facing felony counts of theft by deception, receiving stolen property and deceptive business practices. He surrendered Monday afternoon and was arraigned on the charges before he was released on his own recognizance.",

    "story": [
      "A highly invasive species of crab \u2014 capable of climbing over 13-foot-high concrete structures \u2014 has been spotted in the Pacific Northwest for the first time, wildlife officials said.",
      "A commercial fisherman caught what officials identified as a Chinese mitten crab last week in the Lower Columbia River, just south of the Washington state border, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, which released a photo of the crab.",
      "\"Chinese mitten crabs have not been confirmed in the Pacific Northwest until now,\" the department said in a news release\u00a0Thursday.",
      "Officials warned that the species wreaked havoc on the San Francisco Bay three decades ago.",
      "\"While this is a rare event in Oregon, mitten crabs caused significant infrastructure and ecological damage in and around San Francisco Bay when the population was at its height in the late 1990s,\" the department said.",
      "Officials said the crab was a large male that could have been introduced illegally into the river by a person or by ballast water from a ship.",
      "What are Chinese mitten crabs?",
      "Chinese mitten crabs are an invasive species that are originally from East Asia. The Smithsonian says that the crabs\u00a0first established an invasive population\u00a0in the San Francisco Bay in the '80s \u2014 but they spread to the East Coast and have recently been spotted in New York.",
      "The crabs, which are named for hairy, mitten-like claws, vary in color from brownish-orange to greenish-brown. Unlike any native crab species, they have four spines on each side as well as a notch between their eyes.",
      "The crabs are capable of climbing over concrete structures at least 13 feet tall, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "\"Mitten crabs can also pass through lock systems and possibly climb fish ladders, or leave the water and walk around barriers where the terrain is suitable,\" the bureau says.",
      "The creatures have been known to steal fishing bait and damage fishing gear, block power plant cooling systems and even amplify flooding risk by burrowing in banks, causing them to become unstable and erode.",
      "Chinese mitten crabs spend most of their lives in freshwater, but adults can only reproduce in saltwater, according to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "\"Newly hatched larvae are in open saltwater in bays and estuaries and fully molted juveniles are found in brackish and freshwater areas within a few miles upstream of saltwater,\" the department says.",
      "What's next",
      "Oregon wildlife biologists are working with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and NOAA to determine if other mitten crabs are in the area. Officials said they will set up trap lines and collect water and samples \"to look for environmental genetic markers specific to the mitten crab.\"",
      "In the meantime, officials are urging the public to keep an eye out for the furry creatures and report any sighting to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife or the Oregon Invasive Species Council.",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 09:55:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Despite President Trump's promise of cuts, the federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days than the same time period last year.",
    "story": [
      "Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office, President Trump's federal government has spent about $220 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same time period last year.",
      "In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government was spending trillions to fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster.",
      "CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found.",
      "Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency and belt-tightening across the administration.",
      "The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements and medical care.",
      "The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans.",
      "Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases in Mr. Trump's first 100 days compared to the same time period in prior years.",
      "According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors.",
      "The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means the national debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier.",
      "And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost.",
      "One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE via layoffs and buyouts. But many of those attempts are facing legal challenges that have delayed or reversed firings.",
      "Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets.",
      "Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade.",
      "The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such as foreign aid, the Education Department and grants to colleges and universities.",
      "There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories. Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "A look at DOGE cuts advertised",
      "Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs.",
      "DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management.",
      "Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" and even those itemizations have included errors and lax documentation.",
      "But even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt.",
      "The administration has already spent about $220 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports.",
      "The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month.",
      "The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week.",
      "The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50.",
      "An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by the DOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million.",
      "Musk recently said his work with DOGE is winding down.",
      "Explore the spending details yourself",
      "You can explore the government's daily account ledgers for yourself. We've isolated the money spent by category in the first few months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period in each of the last 10 years.",
      "You can search for agencies or spending categories below to see the change over time and how much or less is being spent during this first 100 days of the Trump administration. We've limited the table to agencies and categories with at least $100 million in spending since Jan. 20, 2025.",

      "At the Port of Los Angeles, which, along with the Port of Long Beach, receives roughly 40% of all imports from Asia, shipments last week were down 10% compared with the same period one year earlier. That number is expected to keep falling.",
      "\"We are now beginning to see the flow of cargo to the Port of Los Angeles slow,\" Port of Los Angeles executive director Eugene Seroka said at a Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commissioners meeting on April 24. \"It's my prediction that in two weeks time, arrivals will drop by 35%,\" he added.",
      "U.S. retailers had rushed to import goods into the country ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariffs going into effect, leading to a spike in imports since last summer. Now, with the 145% tariffs making goods from China roughly two-and-a-half times more expensive than they were last year, \"essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers have ceased,\" Seroka said.",
      "By another estimate, container bookings from China to the U.S. are down by as much as 60%, according to Flexport, a supply chain management company.",
      "The dip comes during what is usually a busy period for imports to the U.S. \"We would normally see an increase in bookings across the board, because this is the beginning of the shipping year,\" said Nathan Strang, director of ocean freight at Flexport. \"It's when back-to-school items and Halloween items start to come in.\"",

      "During his campaign last year, President Trump repeatedly attacked former President Joe Biden for his handling of the economy, vowing to boost economic growth and\u00a0lower inflation. But 100 days into his second term in the White House, the president is struggling to deliver on those promises.",
      "Mr. Trump's signature policies on trade, immigration and government spending have not only failed to spark economic growth \u2014 they're contributing to a sharp contraction in activity and threaten to re-ignite inflation, data shows. Economists also\u00a0warn that the chances of a U.S. recession\u00a0are rising.",
      "For millions of employers around the country, the Trump administration's helter-skelter approach to imposing tariffs on key trading partners, along with just about every other country on the planet,\u00a0has been challenging, corporate executives and small business owners have told CBS News.",
      "\"I can't think of a precedent for anything like this,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch of the impact of Mr. Trump's first 100 days on the economy.",
      "\"President Reagan, for instance, implemented a lot of changes in terms of tax policy and defense spending and cuts, and those things had big impacts,\" she added, \"but the element here that's quite different is the approach, which has been quite inconsistent and chaotic.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's loyal base of supporters continues to voice support, among other voters there's also a widespread and growing belief that the administration is too focused on\u00a0tariffs\u00a0and not focused enough on lowering prices, according to CBS News polling about the president's first 100 days in office.",
      "Such concerns come as the White House makes a sharp break with the country's traditional playbook on global trade. The result, say critics, includes the highest tariffs in more than a century; sudden, confusing\u00a0shifts in tariff policy\u00a0and major damage to the U.S.' geopolitical relationships.",
      "\"Tariffs have been an unmitigated disaster, economically,\" former Senator Phil Gramm, a Republican and erstwhile economics professor at Texas A&M University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There's no doubt about it that the tariff policy in and of itself will drive up prices because tariffs are a tax. And remember, 61% of imports are component parts to be used in the production of goods and services in America.\"",
      "Gramm added, \"I want to emphasize that the harm of tariffs isn't just inflation \u2014 it's what they do for efficiency and economic growth.\"",
      "The Trump administration stands by its economic record to date, with White House spokesman Kush Deai saying in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch that \"President Trump's America First policies are delivering much-needed economic relief for everyday Americans while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness.\"",
      "\"Within 100 days of President Trump's second term in office, Americans saw the first monthly price drop in years in the March inflation report, while industry leaders ranging from Apple to Hyundai to Nvidia have made trillions in historic investment commitments to reshore manufacturing back to the United States,\" Desai added. \"President Trump delivered a historic economy in his first term, and he's running back the success in his second term.\"",
      "Economic slowdown",

      "The country's gross domestic product \u2014 the total annual value of all the goods and services produced in the U.S. \u2014 is forecast to slow to 0.8% in the first three months of 2025, a sharp decline from 2.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, according to economists polled by financial services firm FactSet. For the year, economic growth is predicted to slow to 1.9%, versus 2.8% in 2024, FactSet data shows.",
      "Economists warn that the U.S. could slip into a recession due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, economists largely gave the U.S. economy a good rating, pointing to its strong growth, low unemployment and progress in bringing inflation under control.",
      "Businesses large and small say the tariffs will cause disruptions, with almost 900 companies in the last 30 days alone citing the barrage of new U.S. levies in their earnings calls. That compares with 100 mentions in December 2024, according to transcripts posted by FactSet. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Walmart and Target\u00a0privately warned Mr. Trump that the tariffs could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves within weeks.",
      "\"Most businesses plan to pass these costs on to their consumers, which will make things more expensive, and we're going to see cuts in consumer spending as a result,\" Vanden Houten of Oxford Economics said, adding that her firm isn't forecasting a recession although it has pared its GDP outlook. \"That's less revenue for businesses.\"",
      "Inflation fears flare",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on a pledge to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" vowing that if he would bring down prices \"very quickly\" in a second term.",
      "But 100 days into his new administration, consumers are skeptical about Mr. Trump's vow to tackle inflation, with 63% telling CBS News in new polling that they believed his policies would cause grocery prices to go up. Only 15% said they believe his administration will help lower their grocery bills.",
      "Consumers are clearly worried about tariffs, with the same CBS News poll finding that 55% of respondents said Mr. Trump doesn't have a clear plan for tariffs and trade. Americans now expect inflation to rise to 6.5% a year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index \u2014 a potentially self-fulling outlook that could cause consumers to pull back on spending.",
      "So far, however, inflation data shows that price increases eased to 2.4% in March, down from 2.8% in February. Falling gas prices have come as a relief for motorists, with the national average for a gallon of regular gas now at $3.17, compared with $3.66 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "Still, many economists forecasts that inflation will pick up later this year as the impact of tariffs works its way through the economy.",
      "The case for tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that his tariff policies will benefit the U.S. economy over the long term. In his view, the cost of the tariffs will spur both U.S. and foreign businesses to expand in the U.S., spawning jobs for American workers and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "Since Mr. Trump's inauguration, some businesses have said they are investing in domestic manufacturing, with Apple planning a $500 billion expansion of its U.S. facilities over four years and IBM on Monday announcing a $150 billion investment to \"fuel the economy.\"",
      "The president also maintains that tariffs will bring in trillions in new federal revenue , helping to offset an extension of his 2017 tax cuts currently being hammered out by Republican lawmakers. But many economists are skeptical that his tariffs could bring in as much as Mr. Trump claims, as consumers will likely reduce their spending on foreign goods\u00a0when their prices rise.",
      "\"Consumers have to be confident to affect their spending,\" noted Donald Boudreaux, an economist at George Mason University (whose book with Sen. Gramm, \"The Triumph of Economic Freedom: Debunking the Seven Great Myths of American Capitalism,\" will be published next month). \"The current policy is reducing their confidence.\"",
      "For his part, Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the impact of U.S. tariffs will cause \"some pain\" for Americans, while adding in a February social media post that \"IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\"",
      "Market turmoil",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the Trump administration's economic policies has been clear: The S&P 500 index has lost 10% of its value since reaching a post-inauguration high on February 19, putting the broad-based market into correction territory.",
      "The dollar has lost about 9% of its value since Mr. Trump's inauguration, according to the U.S. dollar index, which compares the value of the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies. Typically, investors rush to the bond market in times of economic uncertainty, but in recent weeks\u00a0bond prices have slid and yields have risen \u2014\u00a0 signs investors are rattled by the impact of Trump administration policies.",
      "\"I would emphasize that this movement in the asset markets is indeed unusual, and it happened particularly after April 2, 'Liberation Day',\" or the day when Mr. Trump announced tariffs on almost every nation on Earth, Boudreaux said. \"It can only be explained by global investor fears of what might happen in the U.S. economy.\"",
      "He added, \"It's too soon to tell how far those fears will go, but the early signs aren't cheery.\"",
      "A boost from tax cuts and deregulation?",
      "To be sure, mounting anxieties among consumers, businesses and investors don't by themselves herald an inevitable economic downturn. And so far, the economy remains resilient, with unemployment near a 50-year low and inflation edging down to 2.4% in March.",
      "Some economists also point to what they view as positives in Mr. Trump's agenda, such as prospects for tax cuts and deregulation, which could spur economic growth. And Mr. Trump has touted his administration's efforts to slash federal spending, overseen by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as a win for taxpayers.",
      "\"We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud and abuse,\" Mr. Trump told Time Magazine in an interview this month.",
      "DOGE, by its account, has cut about $160 billion in costs, or about 2.4% of the federal government's roughly $6.8 trillion in annual spending. But some critics have pointed out that the cuts will ultimately cost taxpayers\u00a0due to rehiring federal workers who were mistakenly fired, lower productivity of remaining workers and through lower tax collections from the IRS, which is reducing its staffing under DOGE's direction.",
      "In the meantime, some observers say the biggest hurdle to Mr. Trump's economic goals is of his own creation.",
      "\"We want Trump to succeed \u2014 in criticizing this trading policy, it's the policy we're criticizing,\" Sen. Gramm said. \"I don't believe the president can achieve what he wants to achieve for America unless his trade policy changes.\"",

    "summary": "Canadian Prime Minster Mark Carney's Liberal Party will retain its hold on power, in a reversal of fortunes seen largely as a reaction to Mr. Trump's actions and rhetoric.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's Liberal Party won Monday's federal election, marking a sharp political turnaround seemingly powered largely by the territorial threats and tariff tactics of President Trump.",
      "Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals were projected to win more of the Canadian Parliament's 343 seats than the rival Conservatives. It wasn't immediately clear if the Liberals would claim an outright majority of at least 172 seats, or if they'd be forced to rely on lawmakers from a smaller party or parties to get new legislation passed.",
      "Canadians decided with Monday's vote to grant the Liberal Party a fourth term in power, now with Carney at the helm, rather than to transfer control to the Conservatives and their populist leader Pierre Poilievre, who only months earlier had been projected to win the election decisively.",
      "The Liberal Party's popularity had been declining for years, eventually leading to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's resignation in March, and the Conservatives appeared poised to take control of the federal government \u2014 until Mr. Trump stepped in.",
      "The American president's previous repeated\u00a0threats to annex Canada and his sweeping tariffs, which have undermined Canada's economy, had dominated the campaign and influenced voters' choices. Domestic issues including affordability, immigration, jobs and crime remained significant factors.",
      "\"As I have been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. Never,\" declared Carney in a victory speech on Monday evening. \"These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen.\"",
      "Calling it a \"hinge moment\" in history, Carney said Canada's \"old relationship with the United States \u2014 a relationship based on steadily increasing integration \u2014 is over. The system of open global trade, anchored by the United States, a system that Canada has relied on since the Second World War, a system that, while not perfect, has helped deliver prosperity for our country for decades, is over. These are tragedies, but it's also our new reality... We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons. We have to look out for ourselves and, above all, we have to take care of each other.\"",
      "According to Carney's office, the newly elected prime minister spoke with Mr. Trump, who called to congratulate him on Tuesday.",
      "\"The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the United States working together - as independent, sovereign nations - for their mutual betterment,\" Carney's office said in a statement. \"To that end, the leaders agreed to meet in person in the near future.\"",
      "Poilievre, a seasoned politician for the Conservatives, lost his parliamentary seat in Ottawa, casting doubt on his continued leadership of the party. Monday's election marked a significant turn of events for the leader, who was first elected to the parliament in 2004.",
      "Despite the blow, Poilievre vowed to remain in his position as party leader, and he pledged in a speech Monday night to keep fighting for change.",
      "\"Every single day, our conservative caucus and I will be holding the government to account on behalf of millions of Canadians who believed in the message of change,\" Poilievre told his party's supporters.",
      "According to Elections Canada, a record number of Canadians \u2014 an estimated 7.3 million \u2014  cast their votes in advance, a 25% increase compared to the 2021 elections.",
      "A diverse group of voters gathered Monday inside a school gym in Milton City, Ontario, to cast their ballots. While they were divided on who would be best to deal with Mr. Trump, they all agreed that Canada's sovereignty, tariffs and the affordability of everyday goods were the main issues on their minds as they cast their votes.",
      "\"Trump's decisions are affecting not just Canada but the rest of the world,\" a couple who voted for the Liberals told CBS News outside a polling station. \"The tariffs affected the market; it affected prices of all goods, food, anything.\"",
      "Opponents cast the Conservatives' leader Poilievre as having similarities with Mr. Trump, which may have ended up costing him on election day.",
      "\"A couple of things that, unfortunately, Pierre has come out with which we didn't agree with,\" the couple in Milton City, who wished to remain anonymous, told CBS News. \"Might sound silly, but the fact he wants to bring back plastic bags and straws \u2014 I didn't like that idea.\"",
      "One voter named Peter said he considered the issue of Canadian sovereignty while casting his vote. Although he did not specify which party he believed could best address concerns over Mr. Trump's threats to make Canada a \"51st state,\" he stressed the need for Canadian unity.",
      "John Ivsky, a self-employed businessman from Milton, said he considered the election crucial, emphasizing the issue of tariffs. He said Canada should seek more and different global partners.",
      "\"Canada needs to build its own economy and broader partnerships,\" Ivsky told CBS News. \"America shouldn't be the only economic, military, or political partner. We need partners all over the world, so we don't suffer from one political change in one country.\"",
      "\"I respect and vote for every party that can support family values, conservative values, freedom of speech, and I vote for the one that can reflect my beliefs, whether that's Liberal or Conservative,\" said Ivsky. \"At this point, Conservatives are the ones that can do that.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump once again injected himself into the election campaign. In a post on Truth Social, he repeated his idea of making Canada the 51st U.S. state and called on Canadian voters to vote for the person who could make that possible \u2014 without naming either political party.",
      "\"Good luck to the Great people of Canada. Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size,\u00a0 WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st State of the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "In response to his remarks, Poilievre said Canada would never become the 51st state, and he urged the American president to stay out of Canadian elections.",
      "\"President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,\" Poilievre said in French in a social media\u00a0post. \"Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st State. Today Canadians can vote for change so we can strengthen our country, stand on our own two feet and stand up to America from a position of strength.\"",
      "In his campaign, Carney pleaded with voters to deliver him a strong mandate to deal with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"President Trump has some obsessive ideas, and that is one,\" Carney said of the annexation threats. \"It's not a joke. It's his very strong desire to make this happen. It's one of the reasons why this crisis is so serious.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 29 Apr 2025 13:59:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Spain's prime minister said a special commission will track down the cause of a massive power outage and all \"necessary measures will be taken\" to stop it from recurring.",
    "story": [
      "Spain's government has set up a special commission to figure out what caused the massive power outage that hit virtually the entire country, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced Tuesday, stressing that no potential causes had been ruled out. He also joined the wider European Union in vowing that everything necessary would be done to prevent a recurrence of the electricity grid failure, which ground most of the Iberian Peninsula \u2014 composed of Spain and neighboring Portugal \u2014   to a halt and left people in the dark until Tuesday morning.",
      "\"All the necessary measures will be taken to ensure that this does not happen again,\" S\u00e1nchez said during a news conference in Madrid, just hours after the lights came back on.",
      "Monday's still-unexplained power outage was the most severe ever to hit Spain and Portugal, which have a combined population of around 60 million people. According to The Associated Press, Spain's roughly 49 million inhabitants saw their country's power generation drop by around 15 gigawatts \u2014   roughly 60% of the typical real-time demand in the nation \u2014 in the space of just five seconds, starting just after noon local time on Monday.",
      "Spanish power distributor Red El\u00e9ctrica said early Tuesday that about 99% of its power capacity had been restored, after many residents of both Spain's capital Madrid and Lisbon in neighboring Portugal went to sleep in total darkness.",
      "Offices across the Iberian Peninsula were closed and traffic was left in chaos on Monday. Airports, along with trains and subway systems, ground to a halt, ATMs ceased to function, and many mobile phone networks went down. Gas-powered generators and battery-powered radios flew off shelves.",
      "What caused the power outage in Spain and Portugal?",
      "S\u00e1nchez had said Monday that a problem in the wider European grid, which he called a \"strong oscillation,\" had been behind the outage, but that was never confirmed or expounded upon by the Spanish leader or the country's electricity providers, and officials subsequently asked people to refrain from speculation, stressing that nothing had been ruled out. On Tuesday, S\u00e1nchez did rule out one possible issue, saying there had been no lack of nuclear power generation capacity on Monday. About 20% of Spain's power comes from its nuclear plants.",
      "REN, Portugal's national electricity grid operator, said Monday there had been a rare atmospheric phenomenon in Spain, which it pinned on extreme temperature variations, but that explanation was also never confirmed, and on Tuesday, Spain's meteorological agency said it had not detected any \"unusual meteorological or atmospheric phenomena\" or unexpectedly dramatic temperature fluctuations the previous day.",
      "Eduardo Prieto, who's in charge of operations for Spain's Red El\u00e9ctrica, said Monday that while the cause remained unclear, the power outage was unprecedented, \"exceptional and extraordinary.\"",
      "The company had said Monday that there was no indication of a cyberattack causing the outage, but S\u00e1nchez said the following day that a separate investigation would continue looking at the possibility.",
      "Antonio Costa, president of the EU's European Council, said Tuesday that there were \"no indications of any cyberattack.\" His colleague Teresa Ribera, one of the executive vice presidents of the European Commission, also seemed to rule out sabotage, but she called the blackout \"one of the most serious episodes recorded in Europe in recent times.\"",
      "The power outage was the second to hit Europe in just over a month. London's Heathrow Airport, one of Europe's busiest hubs, was shut down for most of March 20 after a local electricity substation went up in flames. The cause of that fire remains under investigation, but London's Metropolitan Police said it did not appear suspicious.",
      "While no officials have suggested that either the fire in London or the blackout on the Iberian Peninsula were the result of nefarious activity, they both came amid heightened concern over Russian sabotage operations targeting Western European nations that support Ukraine.",
      "A source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News in early November that U.S. and European law enforcement agencies were working together to investigate whether incendiary devices that detonated in July 2024 at DHL logistics hubs in Germany and Britain were part of a larger\u00a0operation directed by Russian military intelligence\u00a0agencies, senior officials in Russia's government, or by outside individuals acting in Russia's perceived interest.",
      "There have also been numerous incidents of undersea cables, mostly carrying power or telecommunications data, being severed or disrupted in recent years, often after Russian or Chinese-linked vessels were in the area.",
      "European officials have said such alleged sabotage actions are part of a Russian \"hybrid war\" against Ukraine's backers and its democratic adversaries in the West.",

      "Irish rappers Kneecap have denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah and publicly apologized to the families of two murdered British lawmakers as the hip-hop trio continue to face public backlash for political views they've expressed at their concerts.",
      "\"Let us be unequivocal: we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah. We condemn all attacks on civilians, always. It is never okay,\" the band said in a statement posted Monday  on social media.",
      "Kneecap's statement came after U.K. police said that they were investigating video related to a Kneecap concert from 2024 in which one of the band's members appears to shout, \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah.\"",
      "Hamas and\u00a0Hezbollah, both currently engaged in\u00a0fighting with Israel, are designated as terrorist groups by the U.S., Israel and European Union.",
      "The British and Irish governments have roundly condemned the language used by the Kneecap members.",
      "Speaking to reporters on Monday, the Republic of Ireland's leader Miche\u00e1l Martin said that support for Hamas or Hezbollah is \"unacceptable\" and asked Kneecap to urgently clarify their views. A spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Monday that he condemned the group's remarks \"in the strongest possible terms.\"",
      "U.K. police also said they were reviewing video from a concert in 2023 in which one Kneecap member appears to call for killing Conservative party lawmakers, who are often known as Tories, by saying on stage: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.\"",
      "Those comments have been sharply criticized by the families of two British lawmakers who were murdered in recent years. The families of Conservative Member of Parliament David Amess, who was stabbed by an ISIS supporter in 2021, and Labour Party MP Jo Cox, who was shot and stabbed multiple times by a neo-Nazi sympathizer, called for a public apology from the group,",
      "In the same statement in which the group denied supporting Hamas and Hezbollah, Kneecap addressed that criticism and said: \"To the Amess and Cox families, we send our heartfelt apologies, we never intended to cause you hurt.\"",
      "Brendan Cox, the husband of the late Jo Cox, called the group's statement \"only half an apology.\"",
      "\"It's fine to say that you're sorry for it, but the way that they have actually spoken about it is to suggest that it's a conspiracy, that they have been targeted unfairly, and for me, that then doesn't come across as unfortunately particularly genuine,\" he told CBS News' partner network BBC Radio.",
      "The latest controversies circling the hip-hop trio come after the group faced intense scrutiny for remarks they made while performing at Coachella earlier this month.",
      "Messages were displayed on a screen behind the band as it performed, including: \"F**k Israel,\" \"Free Palestine\" and \"Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people.\"",

    "story": [
      "The reign of Pope Francis is over, and as the Catholic Church mourns his death, it is also looking to the future. On Monday \u2014 two days after\u00a0the pope's funeral\u00a0\u2014 the Vatican confirmed that a papal conclave will begin on May 7 to choose his successor.",
      "The question now turns to which man \u2014 and it will be a man, as women cannot be ordained priests in the Catholic Church \u2014 will emerge and step onto the balcony in papal regalia to greet the crowds massed in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "Below is a look inside the conclave process, with a step-by-step breakdown of how the next pope will be chosen and anointed under Michelangelo's iconic fresco on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.",
      "What is the papal conclave, exactly?",
      "The papal conclave is the closely guarded gathering of the cardinal electors \u2014 all serving cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 to elect the next pope.",
      "The exact number varies, but there are currently 135 cardinal electors eligible to convene at the Vatican from around the world to choose the successor to Pope Francis. At least one, Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, has said he will not enter the conclave after being sentenced to 5-1/2 years in jail by a Vatican court in 2023 for embezzlement and fraud. He has denied all wrongdoing and remains free pending an appeal to the Vatican court, but said on April 29 that he would not take part in the conclave.",
      "Of all the current cardinal electors, a large majority \u2014 108 \u2014 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries, including 10 from the United States.",
      "When will the papal conclave begin?",
      "The Vatican has announced that the conclave will begin on Wednesday, May 7.",
      "Under church rules, it must start 15 to 20 days after a pope's death; Pope Francis died on April 21.",
      "Ahead of the conclave, on May 5, Vatican officials and employees who will help support the process, including other clergy, security personnel, drivers, cleaning crews, doctors and nurses, must take an oath of secrecy.",
      "How does the papal conclave work?",
      "How this assembly proceeds to choose the next pope is a process that dates back hundreds of years \u2014 an intricate, choreographed procession of rituals and ballots.",
      "On the first day of the papal conclave, the cardinal electors will shut themselves off from the outside world and begin the momentous task of choosing \u2014 likely from among their own ranks \u2014 the man who will become the 267th Bishop of Rome, better known as the pope.",
      "On Day One, the cardinals celebrate a morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walk in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, which will have undergone a security sweep to check for any illicit recording devices before their arrival.",
      "For centuries, the cardinal electors were physically locked inside the Sistine Chapel until they elected a new pontiff, left to eat and sleep beneath Michelangelo's vivid Renaissance masterpiece. These days, they do leave to rest and share meals at Santa Marta House \u2014 a hotel-like residence inside Vatican City where Francis had his own personal apartment during his pontificate \u2014 for however many days it takes them to come to a decision.",
      "Once the cardinals have all filed into the chapel, its great bronze doors are dramatically closed and sealed, and the first day's voting begins.",
      "How does the voting for a new pope work?",
      "The cardinals will have already discussed the merits of each papal prospect during days of \"general congregations\" at the Vatican before the conclave, but now the voting begins. Choosing the new pope requires not just a majority, but a two-thirds plus-one vote among the cardinal electors for a candidate to win. Pope Benedict XVI, who led the church prior to Francis, raised the threshold and enshrined the two-thirds requirement into church law two days before he stepped down.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "To vote, each cardinal writes their chosen candidate's name on a ballot, disguising his handwriting, then walks to an altar at the front of the chapel and deposits the paper onto a ceremonial plate. He then tips the ballot from the plate into a chalice-urn.",
      "As they are counted and the handwritten entries recorded by three cardinals at the altar, known as scrutineers, the ballots are deposited into another urn.",
      "A third urn, made of gilded bronze and silver and adorned with Christian imagery, is used to ferry ballots from any cardinals too ill to leave their sleeping quarters to the chapel for counting.",
      "After the first vote is held on the first afternoon, the cardinals' ballots are placed into one of two small ovens inside the Sistine Chapel and burned. A plume of smoke flows up a chimney and into the air over St. Peter's Square, watched for eagerly by the faithful, and the world's media.",
      "If that round of voting yields no winner, the smoke will be black \u2014 a sign to the world that the Holy See remains vacant.",
      "How long can a conclave last?",
      "The voting process will repeat itself the following day, with the cardinals holding two ballots in the morning and two in the afternoon. If the morning sessions are inconclusive, black smoke will be seen again around lunchtime \u2014 early morning on the U.S. East Coast.",
      "If there's still no winner following the afternoon votes, more black smoke will stream into the early evening Roman sky.",
      "If there's no two-thirds majority after three days, voting is paused for a day to allow time for prayer, discussion and a \"brief spiritual exhortation\" by the senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons.",
      "Then the voting process resumes. A conclave will last until enough of the cardinal electors agree on a choice for the next pope.",
      "How long has it taken to choose a new pope in the past?",
      "The longest conclave in history was the one that brought Pope Gregory X to the papacy in 1281. It lasted almost three years from the time the cardinals first began their voting.",
      "Recent conclaves, however, have lasted just days. Pope John Paul II needed eight ballots, over two days, to become the pontiff in 1978. His successor, Benedict XVI, was chosen on the fourth ballot, after two days, in 2005.",
      "Francis, in 2013, needed a mere five ballots, with the voting taking just 24 hours.",
      "What will happen once the conclave chooses the next pope?",
      "When enough cardinals agree on a candidate and the vote reaches the two-thirds-plus-one threshold, the chosen man is asked if he accepts the role. He will acknowledge by simply saying the word for \"I accept\" in Latin: \"Accepto.\"",
      "At that point, he becomes the new pope and will state his chosen pontifical name before the assembled cardinals. The most common papal name has been John, used 21 times. Others, including Simplicius, Hilarius and Zosimus, have only ever been used once. Pope Francis was also the first to choose his papal name.",
      "The ballots are then burned in the stove, but this time, a chemical additive is left out to create the much-anticipated plume of \"fumata bianca,\" white smoke.",
      "There has been confusion during some past conclaves over the color of the smoke rising over the chapel, so two conclaves ago, in 2005, a new tradition began. In addition to the white smoke, bells now chime, heralding the news that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "The new pope then immediately goes into a chamber adjoining the Sistine Chapel to be clad in the papal robes.",
      "As the faithful and the curious crowd into St. Peter's Square below, the cardinal deacon steps out onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to introduce the new pontiff with the famous phrase, \"Habemus papa\" \u2014 We have a pope.",

      "During World War II, within the walls of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau, a Jewish prisoner secretly penned a short note and hid it inside a violin he had crafted under harrowing circumstances \u2014 a message to the future that would remain undiscovered for more than 80 years.",
      "\"Trial instrument, made under difficult conditions with no tools and materials,\" the worn note read. \"Dachau. Anno 1941, Franciszek Kempa.\"",
      "The origins of the violin, built in 1941 by Franciszek \"Franz\" Kempa while imprisoned by the Nazis at Dachau in southern Germany, remained unnoticed for decades. It wasn't until art dealers in Hungary sent the instrument out for repairs \u2014 after having stored it for years among a set of purchased furniture \u2014 that its history came to light.",
      "Although the instrument's craftsmanship pointed clearly to a skilled maker, the professional repairing it was puzzled by the poor quality of the wood and the crude tools used to create it, which didn't match the evident skill involved.",
      "\"If you look at its proportions and structure, you can see that it's a master violin, made by a man who was proficient in his craft,\" said Szandra Katona, one of the Hungarian art dealers who discovered the origins of the violin. \"But the choice of wood was completely incomprehensible.\"",
      "Motivated by the contradiction, the professional disassembled the violin, revealing Kempa's hidden note - an apparent explanation, even an apology, from a master violin maker forced by the brutal limitations of his captivity to build an instrument that fell short of his own standards.",
      "Dachau, located near Munich, was the first concentration camp established by the Nazis in March 1933. It initially housed political prisoners but later became a model for other camps, imprisoning Jews, Roma, clergy, homosexuals, and others targeted by the Nazi regime.",
      "Over time, it became a site of forced labor, medical experiments, and brutal punishment, and remained in operation until it was liberated by American forces on April 29, 1945. At least 40,000 people are believed to have died there due to starvation, disease, execution, or mistreatment.",
      "There is ample evidence that musical instruments were present in concentration camps across Central and Eastern Europe during World War II. For propaganda purposes, the Nazis often permitted or even encouraged the formation of musical groups to give a false impression to the outside world about life in the camps.",
      "However, all known instruments that survived Dachau are believed to have been brought in by prisoners. Kempa's \"violin of hope,\" as it has come to be called, is the only known instrument actually built inside the camp.",
      "It is unknown how the violin left Dachau and ultimately made its way to Hungary. But Kempa, according to documents provided to the Hungarian art dealers by the museum at the Dachau memorial site, survived the war and returned to his native Poland to continue making instruments before dying in 1953.",
      "The documents also suggest that Kempa was known to the Nazis as an instrument maker - something Tam\u00e1s T\u00e1losi, one of the art dealers, believes may have spared him the fate of millions of others that perished in the camps.",
      "\"We named it the 'violin of hope' because if someone ends up in a difficult situation, having a task or a challenge helps them get through a lot of things,\" T\u00e1losi said. \"You focus not on the problem, but on the task itself, and I think this helped the maker of this instrument to survive the concentration camp.\"",

    "story": [
      "A massive, unprecedented power outage\u00a0hit large parts of Spain as well as Portugal\u00a0on Monday. The blackout halted subway and railway trains, cut phone service and shut down traffic lights and ATMs for the millions of people who live across Europe's Iberian Peninsula.",
      "Spanish power distributor Red El\u00e9ctrica finally said early Tuesday morning that about 99% of the power capacity had been restored across the country. Monday night, many city residents, including in Spain's capital of Madrid, went to sleep in total darkness.",
      "The lights also flickered back on Tuesday morning in Portugal's capital, Lisbon. Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro had earlier said he expected power to be restored by the end of the day on Monday.",
      "Power outage hits Spain's and Portugal's capitals",
      "Offices closed and traffic was snarled as traffic lights stopped working across Madrid on Monday. It was not possible to make calls on many mobile phone networks, though some apps were working. In Barcelona, residents walked into stores searching for battery-powered radios and civilians directed traffic at junctions along the Gran Via avenue that cuts through the city.",
      "Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said that a problem in the European grid that he described as a \"strong oscillation\" was behind the outage, but that the cause was still being determined. The Spanish leader asked the public to refrain from speculation and said no theory about the cause of the outage had been discarded.",
      "REN, the Portuguese grid operator, said a rare atmospheric phenomenon in Spain from extreme temperature variations was behind the massive outage, according to the Reuters news agency. The Portuguese National Cybersecurity Center issued a statement saying there was no sign the outage was due to a cyberattack.",
      "Red El\u00e9ctrica declined to speculate on the causes of the blackout. Eduardo Prieto, head of operations at Red Electrica, told journalists it was unprecedented, calling the event \"exceptional and extraordinary.\"",
      "Electricity was being pulled from Morocco and France to restore power to southern and northern Spain, Sanchez said, thanking their governments. Spain was also increasing the production from hydroelectric and combined cycle thermal power plants.",
      "S\u00e1nchez convened an extraordinary meeting of Spain's National Security Council and visited Red El\u00e9ctrica to follow efforts at restoring grid operations. Montenegro said he has spoken several times to S\u00e1nchez. The Portuguese Cabinet convened an emergency meeting at the prime minister's residence.",
      "The two countries have a combined population of about 60 million people. It was not immediately clear how many were affected. It is rare to have such a widespread outage across the Iberian Peninsula.",
      "Spain's Canary Islands, Balearic Islands and the territories of Ceuta and Melilla, located across the Mediterranean in Africa, were not impacted by the outage.",
      "The blackout is the second serious European power outage in less than six weeks after a March 20 fire shut down Heathrow Airport in the U.K., and it comes as authorities across Europe gird against sabotage backed by Russia.",
      "A graph on Spain's electricity network website showing demand across the country indicated a steep drop from around 12:15 p.m. from 27,500 megawatts to nearly 15,000 megawatts. By 7 a.m. local time on Tuesday, Red El\u00e9ctrica said the national grid was producing 21.265 megawatts, adding that 99.5% of capacity had been restored.",
      "When the blackout hit on Monday, some people were trapped in elevators, garages and subway tunnels. Almost 300 rescue operations were carried out to free those trapped inside elevators in the Madrid region alone, authorities said.",
      "Spanish airports were forced to operate on backup electrical systems and some flights were delayed, according to Aena, which runs 56 airports in Spain, including Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "In Lisbon, terminals closed and throngs of tourists sat outside in the sun and the shade, waiting for news about their flights.",
      "\"We haven't seen any plane arriving or departing in the 50 minutes we've been waiting here,\" Dutch tourist Marc Brandsma told The Associated Press.",
      "Train services in both countries ground to a halt. Video aired on Spanish television showed people evacuating metro stations in Madrid and empty stations with trains stopped in Barcelona. Spain's Transportation Minister Oscar Puente posted on the social platform X that it wouldn't be possible to restart trains later Monday, even if the power returned.",
      "Play at the Madrid Open tennis tournament was suspended. Three matches were underway when power went down.",
      "Spain's traffic department asked citizens to avoid using their cars as much as possible due to the power outage, which has affected traffic lights and electrical road signage.",
      "Barcelona's streets filled with throngs of people on sidewalks, milling about in front of darkened stores and offices and exchanging information on what had happened.",
      "\"We are lucky. Some people got trapped in the metro. And there is a positive side: We are talking more with each other,\" Monste Cort\u00e9s said. She said dinner would be sliced bread and cold cuts.",
      "Immediate concerns were which phone companies still had at least some spotty coverage, or where internet access might be found. Another concern was how to get home with the subway shut and public buses packed. Some took advantage of the lack of connectivity and transport to enjoy the sunshine on restaurant terraces.",
      "In Terrassa, an industrial town 30 miles from Barcelona, stores selling generators were out of stock after people lined up to buy them.",
      "Parts of France were also briefly affected, according to Reuters. French grid operator RTE said it was working to provide power to some parts of northern Spain.",
      "In Portugal, a country of some 10.6 million people, the outage hit Lisbon and surrounding areas, as well as northern and southern parts of the country. Portuguese police placed more officers on duty to direct traffic and cope with increased requests for help, including from people trapped in elevators.",
      "Hospitals and other emergency services in both Spain and Portugal switched to generators. Gas stations stopped working.",
      "Portugal's National Authority for Emergencies and Civil Protection said backup power systems were operating.",
      "Several Lisbon subway cars were evacuated, reports said. Also in Portugal, courts stopped work and ATMs and electronic payment systems were affected.",

The U.S. military has hammered the Iran-backed Houthis with near-daily strikes since March 15 in an operation dubbed \"Rough Rider,\" seeking to end the threat they pose to vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.",
      "The Houthis have for more than a year launched strikes targeting Israel and Western vessels in the Red Sea, including U.S. warships, in what they describe as solidarity with the Palestinians, since Hamas sparked the war in Gaza by launching its unprecedented terrorist attack on Israel in October 2023.",
      "On Sunday, the military said it has hit more than 800 targets in Yemen since mid-March, killing hundreds of Houthi rebels including members of the group's leadership.",

      "\"Civil defense teams and the Red Crescent are continuing their efforts at the scene of the American crime,\" it said.",
      "AFP could not independently confirm the veracity of Al-Masirah's claim that the strikes had hit a migrant detention center, or the toll. AFP has contacted the U.S. military for comment.",
      "According to a statement cited by Al-Masirah from the Houthi administration's interior ministry, the center housed \"115 migrants, all from Africa.\"",
      "The broadcaster ran video that showed bodies stuck under rubble and rescuers working to help the casualties.",

      "The Houthis began targeting shipping in late 2023, preventing ships from passing through the Suez Canal \u2014 a vital route that normally carries about 12% of global trade \u2014 forcing many companies into a costly detour around the tip of southern Africa.",
      "In a statement that provided its most detailed accounting of the operation so far, CENTCOM, the U.S. military command responsible for the Middle East said: \"Since the start of Operation Rough Rider, USCENTCOM has struck over 800 targets.",
      "\"These strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders.\" \u00ad\u00ad \"The strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defence systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations,\" CENTCOM said.",
      "Despite the strikes, however, the Houthis \u2014 who control large swaths of Yemen and have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition backing the internationally recognized \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adgovernment since 2015 \u2014 have continued to claim attacks against both U.S. vessels and Israel.",
      "CENTCOM said that \"while the Houthis have continued to attack our vessels, our operations have degraded the pace and effectiveness of their attacks. Ballistic missile launches have dropped by 69 percent. Additionally, attacks from one-way attack drones have decreased by 55 percent.\"",
      "\"Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis. The Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime,\" the military command said.",
      "\"We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region,\" it added.",

      "The climber was identified only as a 27-year-old Chinese student living in Japan. He made an emergency call on April 22 and was airlifted after developing symptoms of altitude sickness, police said, adding that his climbing irons also were damaged.",
      "On Saturday, he returned to the mountain's Fujinomiya trail nearly 10,000 feet above sea level to look for his cell phone and other belongings left behind, Shizuoka prefectural police said. Another climber found him there unable to move after he apparently got sick for a second time, police said.",
      "\"He was suspected of having altitude sickness and was taken to hospital,\" a police spokesman in the Shizuoka region told Agence France-Presse on Monday.",
      "It was not known whether he was able to find his phone in the end, local media reported.",
      "The mountain's hiking trails are officially open only from July to early September, but there is no penalty for hiking off-season. There also is no charge or penalty when a climber needs to be rescued, but the Chinese student's case prompted an uproar on social media and generated calls for him to be charged, at least for his second rescue.",
      "Following the man's rescue, police in Shizuoka prefecture reiterated its advice against climbing the mountain during the off-season as the weather could suddenly change, making it hard for rescuers to respond, the BBC reported. Medical facilities along the trails are also closed.",
      "Police urged all climbers to use caution, noting that the mountain has low temperatures and is covered in snow even in spring.",

      "\"There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days,\" he wrote in the post. \"It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want to stop the war, he's just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions?'

      "Francis sharply disagreed with Mr. Trump's approach on issues including immigration, the treatment of migrants and climate change. The Argentine pontiff and the American president sparred early in their relationship over immigration. In 2016, Francis, alluding to then-candidate Trump and his campaign slogan of \"Build the wall,\" called anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants \"not Christian.\" Mr. Trump said the comment was \"disgraceful.\"",

      "Kara Schmiemann of Red Banyan PR told Fox News Digital, \"This type of strategy, flooding the market with appearances as an attempt to show normalcy and appear[ing] unbothered or unaffected by the drama, is typically not well-advised in crisis response planning.\"",
      "\"While there is certainly a time and place for this approach, and it can sometimes be very effective, in this case it doesn't allow for the heat to die down. The public can be forgiving, but they need time and a reason to forgive and forget. Blake and Ryan seem to be continuing to fan the flames, and it is not landing particularly well for all circles.\"",
      "\"If the PDA-filled images were all that the public saw, their PDA would have definitely helped their image amid the ongoing Baldoni lawsuit drama, because they have always been celebrated as a Hollywood \u2018it couple\u2019 with an amazing relationship,\" relationship expert Nicole Moore said. \"The issue for Blake and Ryan's image is that a large portion of the public no longer gets their information solely from media outlets but from social media and online commentators.\"",

      "\"When the public sees Blake and Ryan looking lovey-dovey at an event, but then goes on TikTok and sees a video about a lip-reader sharing that Blake ordered Ryan to kiss her, for instance, it creates mistrust in the couple and plants seeds of doubt that their relationship is staged,\" she explained. \"So much of the public opinion regarding the Baldoni lawsuit drama has been shaped by voices outside of traditional media, and that's been to Blake and Ryan's detriment.\"",

      "Crediting her mother for influencing her with her \"unwavering bravery,\" Lively said her mom \"never got justice\" from the incident and explained she survived the incident because she had heard stories from women in similar circumstances, particularly a story shared on a radio show.",
      "\"And because of hearing that woman speak to her experience instead of shutting down in fear and unfair shame, my mom is alive today,\" Lively said.",
      "\"Unlike her public displays of affection with her husband, which has been par for the course throughout their courtship and marriage, the timing of this revelation hits the 'funny bone' of armchair skeptics, causing them to jerk in response,\" Doug Eldridge, founder of Achilles PR, told Fox News Digital.",
      "He continued, \"Given all the scrutiny surrounding her demeanor during the press tour for 'It Ends With Us,' why not bring this incredibly personal experience up then? Wouldn't that have lent a sense of authenticity and relatability in terms of her passion and commitment to a film that was tackling such a difficult topic as domestic abuse?",

      "\"Sadly, whether accurate or not, this comes off as a thinly veiled attempt at garnering public sympathy by repositioning herself as the 'victim' in hopes of distracting and reframing the audience's focus.\"",
      "Schmiemann agreed, saying, \"If this was a ploy to gain sympathy, that can be easily sussed out by the public and could be even more damaging. And in this particular case, the irony of discussing assault now, when she previously received backlash for not sufficiently highlighting the horrors of domestic violence in her movie promotion strategy, it is a tough one to\u00a0reconcile.\"",
      "\"The public can be forgiving, but they need time and a reason to forgive and forget.\"",
      "While public opinion remains divided on Lively and Reynolds, they have at least one famous name offering support: Reynolds\u2019 \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" co-star Hugh Jackman.",
      "On Monday, Jackman posted a group photo with the couple, director Shawn Levy, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci on his Instagram stories, writing in the caption, \"I couldn\u2019t love these people more if they were my own blood.\"",

      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "Moore says, \"Hollywood actors are often obsessed with protecting their image and profitability, so the fact that Hugh is supporting Blake and Ryan publicly likely means that he doesn't\u00a0anticipate doing so will hurt his own brand.\u00a0There has been extensive media coverage on the close friendly relationship between Hugh and Ryan, so it would\u00a0likely\u00a0appear weird to the public if Hugh didn't support his friend.\"",
      "\"If the lawsuit ends up going in Baldoni's favor and the public starts to see\u00a0Blake and Ryan as perpetrators of harm due to the verdict, that's likely when Hugh will need to distance himself from the couple in order to\u00a0protect his image,\" she added.",
      "Just as Lively and Reynolds have continued to step out in public, Justin Baldoni has remained largely hidden from view.",
      "\"Baldoni is making the right move by avoiding the public eye because he's mitigating any\u00a0damage that\u00a0might occur from a misstep at a\u00a0public\u00a0appearance,\" Moore said. \"Right now,\u00a0Baldoni appears to have the favor of the\u00a0public, and he's wise to ride the wave of that\u00a0favor without adding any potentially negative press or attention to the mix.\"",

      "JUSTIN BALDONI CALLS OUT BLAKE LIVELY FOR DEMANDING PRIVACY AFTER PUBLICIZING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS",
      "She continued, \"Baldoni's strategy appears to be mostly defending back after\u00a0he's directly attacked\u00a0rather than\u00a0attempting to position himself favorably through public\u00a0appearances,\u00a0and this appears to be working as it makes the public see him as the little guy defending\u00a0himself against Hollywood giants.\"",
      "In Eldridge\u2019s opinion: \"Baldoni's moves have been flawless up to this point. From an optics standpoint, he had an accuser make the first move with a splashy, long-form piece in the New York Times. His response was measured and meaningful; ironically, it centered mostly on a series of indelible 'receipts' as well as allowing fans to find the cracks in Lively's sidewalk, knowing she'd eventually trip up.\"",
      "Schmiemann said, \"Time and silence cannot be underestimated when dealing with as much nuance and public criticism as Blake and Ryan seem to be facing. Of course, they must still live their lives and work and care for their family, but being strategic about the when and where is incredibly important. If they continue to step out too frequently, you create additional opportunities for the story to remain in the public eye and for a repeated resurgence of criticism and hate.\"",

      "Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, who is considered one of the most vulnerable incumbent Democrats heading into next year\u2019s midterm elections, is facing criticism for her recent opposition to President Trump\u2019s tariff plans despite a long history of fighting for tariffs while representing union-heavy northwest Ohio.",
      "Kaptur, who has served in Congress since the early 1980s, has been vocally criticizing Trump over his tariff plan, including\u00a0on the House floor last month when she argued that a 25% tariff on Canada would \"raise your prices on everything.\"",
      "In February,\u00a0Kaptur said, \"Across our country, people are experiencing a worrisome economic reality. Prices are on the rise. Trade wars and short supply of goods will cause more inflation. Prices are up 3% across the board. Egg prices are up 53%. Too many families are overwhelmed and facing really hard choices.\"",
      "Kaptur\u2019s criticisms of tariffs, which have been echoed by many other Democrats as well as some conservatives within the GOP and have also resulted in lawsuits from Democrats who say they will lead to inflation, come after years of promoting the idea of tariffs as a way to \"level the playing field\" on trade.",

They\u2019ve been over half a trillion dollars in the red for over a quarter-century. We have lost thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs. We\u2019ve had production platforms shut down in many major industries, including those I represent,\" Kaptur, speaking to BBC in 2018, said in response to concerns that Trump\u2019s steel tariffs in his first term could start a \"trade war,\" adding that the \"whole trade regimen globally needs to be reformed.\"",
      "Two years earlier, Kaptur called for the need to \"have a real reckoning\" on trade while also supporting the use of tariffs during an interview on C-SPAN.",

We don't want to create walls. We want to create open trade and that would [save] the incomes and livelihoods of millions of Americans across this country.\"",
      "The United Auto Workers (UAW) \u2014 who Kaptur has previously supported, even touting that her parents were members of the union \u2014 has come out in favor of Trump\u2019s tariffs, and in 1994, Kaptur\u00a0said on C-SPAN\u00a0that a \"large share of our trade deficit is in the automotive area\" and largely due to \"outsourcing production all over the world,\" which had a \"tremendous impact on the ability of ordinary people in communities across this country to earn a decent living because we pay our workers more than they do in Mexico or China.\"",

      "\"The hollowing out of our manufacturing base to the benefit and enrichment of Wall Street has been a decades-long attack on working men and women in my district, and across America,\" Kaptur said. \"Smart and targeted tariffs are a critical tool in the arsenal to protect workers, and can operate as part of a strategy to fight unfair trade practices from authoritarian nations such as China and Russia.\"",
      "\"But, the arbitrary and sudden tariffs across the board on more than 180 countries and territories, with exemptions only given out depending on who was able to pay $500,000 for a seat at 'The Executive Branch' or $250,000 a piece for a table Mar-a-Lago is unfair,\" Kaptur continued. \"This comes at the same time this Administration is cutting off critical investments in manufacturing from the CHIPS Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and American Rescue Plan Act, which is eliminating tens of thousands of American manufacturing jobs, and is a recipe for pain and failure.\"",

      "Kaptur added that the tariffs on Canada \"in particular\" are \"exacting great pain on families, workers, and companies across our region struggling to compete, and are raising the cost of gas, groceries, lumber, housing, cars, and so much more.\"",
      "\"Trump's Tariffs hurt working families, while killing the livelihood of those who work in manufacturing, farming, and construction. The Trump Tariffs are a recipe for disaster that are already hurting tens of thousands across the region I represent in Northwest Ohio \u2014 we deserve a comprehensive strategy on trade that prioritizes workers, not Wall Street speculators.\"",

      "\"Left-wing extremists tried to muscle the Green New Deal through Congress during your tenure as Puerto Rico\u2019s Resident Commissioner,\" American Energy Institute CEO Jason Isaac wrote in a letter to Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n.",
      "\"They failed. Now they have turned to the courts to impose their agenda on our country \u2013 and Puerto Rico is participating.\"",
      "The letter outlines \"three active tracks of litigation\" that Isaac labels a \"coordinated lawfare attack on our quality\" of life, including a\u00a0lawsuit filed by dozens of Puerto Rico cities and towns blaming energy companies for climate change and seeking damages.",

      "\"Their goal is to bankrupt energy companies or to leverage the threat of tort damages to force outcomes that would be disastrous for Puerto Rico and the rest of the nation,\" Isaac wrote.",
      "Isaac told Fox News Digital that groups like the Environmental Law Institute (ELI) have been instrumental in the green energy push in Puerto Rico and throughout the United States.",
      "The Washington, D.C.-based ELI created the Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) in 2018, establishing a first-of-its-kind resource to provide \"reliable, up-to-date information\" about climate change litigation, according to the group. The project's reach has extended to various state and federal courts, including powerful appellate courts, and comes as various cities and states\u00a0pursue high-profile litigation against the oil industry.",
      "Fox News Digital has previously reported on the group, funded by left-wing nonprofits, and how critics say it continues to work with judges and experts involved in climate change litigation despite publicly downplaying the extent of those connections.",
      "\"They're going out and really kind of rigging the game before cases have even been brought to the courts,\" Isaac said. \"They've tainted over 2,000 American judges at the federal and state level using climate education, these so-called climate education modules, modules that had even been debunked by left-leaning organizations like Snopes.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, ELI communications director Nick Collin said, \"ELI has decades of experience providing highly respected judicial education programs. The Climate Judiciary Project offers evidence-based information about climate science and trends in the law so that judges can make informed decisions. It does not participate in litigation, support or coordinate with parties in litigation, and it does not tell judges how to rule in any case or on any issue.\"",
      "Gonzalez, a Republican, has signaled that she is open to embracing fossil fuels and Isaac's letter calls on her to take three key steps to push back on climate activists on the island.",
      "First, Isaac asks Gonzales to \"Direct the Secretary of Justice to withdraw Puerto Rico\u2019s complaint in the Puerto Rico v. Exxon Mobil case filed in the Superior Court of San Juan.\"",
      "Second, the letter asks the governor to \"file amicus briefs in the San Juan and Puerto Rican municipalities litigation in favor of dismissal with prejudice.\"",
      "RESEARCHERS BLAME CA WILDFIRES ON CLIMATE CHANGE, PEDDLE 'ALARMIST' NON-PEER REVIEWED STUDIES: EXPERTS",
      "The letter also asks for judges to be appointed to the Puerto Rican judiciary who \"will respect the separation of powers and leave political issues to the democratically elected branches\" and for the government to \"discourage state contracts with outside counsel, such as Milberg or Smouse & Mason, who are using public legal engagements to advance far-left political objectives.\"",
      "Puerto Rico's power grid is considered to be barely functional as blackouts have become a part of everyday life, including the most recent grid failure during Holy Week that left more than 1.4 million residents without power for days.",
      "It has been estimated that power failures cost the island $230 million in lost revenue every day.",
      "Ultimately, it\u2019s the Puerto Rican people who suffer the most when climate litigation hampers the island\u2019s grid, Isaac told Fox News Digital, explaining that residents are living in \"energy poverty\" with constant rolling blackouts and an unreliable grid.",
      "\"They're kind of experiencing what the energy transition does, it transitions people from affordable and reliable energy to less reliable energy, economic despair,\" Isaac said.",

      "\"Climate lawfare threatens to derail your administration\u2019s common-sense approach,\" Isaac wrote. \"The climate plaintiffs are advancing a fundamentally neocolonial agenda. They are steering Puerto Rico toward a \u2018green\u2019 energy future it did not choose \u2013 one that ignores the basic needs of its people, who simply require cheap and reliable electricity.\"",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Cybercriminals always find new ways to scam you, whether it\u2019s mimicking a government agency, creating a fake website or delivering malware disguised as a software update. Just when you think you\u2019ve seen it all, they come up with a new trick.",
      "This time, the FBI has issued an alert: Hackers are using a \"time-traveling\" technique to bypass your device\u2019s security measures. No, we\u2019re not talking about actual time travel (though wouldn\u2019t that be something?). This is a sophisticated cyberattack where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to sneak past security defenses.",

      "A man working on his laptops (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The concept of \"time-traveling hackers\" refers not to literal time travel but to a sophisticated cyberattack technique where hackers manipulate a system's internal clock to bypass security measures. This attack is reportedly tied to the Medusa ransomware gang.",
      "In this type of attack, hackers exploit expired security certificates by altering the system date on a targeted device to a time when those certificates were still valid. For example, a security certificate that expired in, say, 2020 could be made usable again if the system's clock is set back to 2019. This allows malicious software signed with these outdated certificates to be recognized as legitimate by the system, effectively \"traveling back in time\" from a security perspective.",
      "This technique was notably used in the Medusa ransomware attacks, which targeted critical infrastructure and prompted an\u00a0FBI cybersecurity advisory (AA25-071A) earlier in 2025. The campaign has affected over 300 critical infrastructure targets. The attackers combined this method with social engineering and exploited unpatched vulnerabilities, amplifying the threat.",
      "The FBI has warned that such attacks pose a significant risk, as they can disable modern security protections like Windows Defender by tricking the system into accepting outdated drivers or software.",

      "DOUBLECLICKJACKING HACK TURNS DOUBLE-CLICKS INTO ACCOUNT TAKEOVERS",
      "What does the FBI recommend?",
      "The FBI is urging organizations to take action quickly, warning that this technique can slip past traditional defenses by taking advantage of how systems trust old certificate data.",
      "To stay protected, they recommend turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere, especially for important stuff like webmail and VPNs. It also helps to have strong endpoint protection and clear security policies and to keep an eye out for any weird changes to system settings, like the device clock suddenly jumping back in time.",
      "A man working on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "RELENTLESS HACKERS ABANDON WINDOWS TO TARGET YOUR APPLE ID",
      "5 ways to stay safe from Medusa malware",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A strong antivirus isn\u2019t just for catching old-school viruses anymore. It can detect phishing links, block malicious downloads and stop ransomware before it gets a foothold. Since the Medusa gang uses fake updates and social engineering to trick users, having strong antivirus software adds a critical layer of protection against threats you might not see coming. Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2)\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0The FBI specifically recommends\u00a0enabling 2FA across all services, especially for high-value targets like webmail accounts, VPNs and remote access tools. 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to break in, even if they\u2019ve managed to steal your username and password through phishing or other tactics.",
      "3)\u00a0Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Many ransomware groups, including Medusa, rely on reused or weak passwords to gain access. Using a strong password (think long, random and unique to each account) greatly reduces that risk. A password manager can help you generate and store complex passwords so you don\u2019t have to remember them all yourself. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Monitor for suspicious system time changes:\u00a0The core of this \"time-traveling\" attack is clock manipulation: Hackers roll back a device\u2019s clock to a time when expired security certificates were still valid. This allows outdated and potentially malicious software to appear trustworthy. Be alert to unexpected system time changes, and if you're managing an organization, use tools that flag and log these types of configuration shifts.",
      "5) Keep systems updated and patch known vulnerabilities:\u00a0The Medusa ransomware campaign has a track record of exploiting unpatched systems. That means old software, outdated drivers and ignored security updates can all become entry points. Regularly\u00a0installing updates for your OS, applications and drivers is one of the most effective ways to stay protected. Don't put off those system notifications; they exist for a reason.",
      "CLICKFIX MALWARE TRICKS YOU INTO INFECTING YOUR OWN WINDOWS PC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Medusa attack is a good example of how cybercriminals are shifting tactics. Instead of relying on traditional methods like brute force or obvious exploits, they are targeting the basic logic that systems depend on to function. In this case, it is something as simple as the system clock. This kind of strategy challenges the way we think about security. It is not just about building stronger defenses but also about questioning the default assumptions built into the technology we use every day.",

As it grows, it can flex around corners and squeeze through narrow gaps, mimicking the movement of a plant vine. Operators control SPROUT using a joystick, steering it through debris while watching a live video feed from a camera mounted at the tip. This setup lets responders see and map hidden void spaces without entering dangerous areas themselves.",

    "story": [
      "These scams can catch Facebook veterans and novices off guard.",
      "Healthcare institutions and insurers arguably collect the most sensitive information about you, including IDs, contact details, addresses and medical records. But they often don\u2019t put in the same level of effort to protect that data.",
      "That\u2019s clear from the growing number of healthcare data breaches we\u2019ve seen recently. In most of those cases, a bad actor was involved.",
      "But in the latest news, health insurance giant Blue Shield of California confirmed that it had been sharing private health data of 4.7 million users with Google for three years without even realizing it.",

      "A person doing a Google search\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson))",
      "What you need to know",
      "Blue Shield of California just admitted to a major data privacy slip that went on for almost three years, from April 2021 to January 2024. It was using Google Analytics to track how people used its member websites. This is totally normal since every business does it. But the tool was accidentally sharing sensitive info with Google Ads because it wasn\u2019t set up properly.",
      "What I find extremely shocking is that it took the company three years to realize it was sharing its user data with Google to run ads. This says a lot about how much these healthcare giants care about protecting your data.",
      "The shared data included a broad array of protected health information (PHI), including names, zip codes, gender, medical claim dates, online account numbers, insurance plan names, group numbers, family data and even search criteria used in its \"Find a Doctor\" feature.",
      "\"Google may have used this data to conduct focused ad campaigns back to those individual members. We want to reassure our members that no bad actor was involved, and, to our knowledge, Google has not used the information for any purpose other than these ads or shared the protected information with anyone,\"\u00a0the company\u00a0said in a notice on its website.",
      "This incident is not isolated. Over the past few years, healthcare and tech companies have come under scrutiny for similar missteps. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have already issued warnings about the use of tracking technologies in healthcare, especially those that might expose patient data to third parties without adequate transparency or safeguards.",
      "A Google spokesperson provided the following comment to CyberGuy when asked about the Blue Shield data breach:",
      "\"Businesses, not Google, manage the data they collect and must inform users about its collection and use. By default, any data sent to Google Analytics for measurement does not identify individuals, and we have strict policies against collecting private health information (PHI) or advertising based on sensitive information.\"",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Impact on patients and the industry",
      "Since the data was only shared with Google and not any other party, the overall risk is relatively low, apart from the clear privacy violation. It\u2019s highly unlikely that anyone else will gain access to it, so the chances of the data being misused are slim. Google says it doesn\u2019t allow ads to be served based on sensitive information like health, so there\u2019s a good chance your data wasn\u2019t even used for advertising.",
      "Blue Shield's case follows a string of similar breaches. Companies like GoodRx, BetterHelp and Kaiser have all faced regulatory and legal consequences for sharing sensitive user data with advertising vendors. Some even settled for millions of dollars. Despite the risks, many healthcare organizations have continued using these tools due to the lack of clear regulatory guardrails, a situation complicated further by a federal court ruling that blocked the Biden administration\u2019s attempts to curb the use of online trackers in healthcare settings.",

      "The Blue Shield of California incident is a reminder that even well-known healthcare providers can mishandle sensitive data. While you can\u2019t always control what happens behind the scenes, there\u00a0are steps you can take to reduce your exposure and safeguard your privacy:",
      "1. Limit what you share on health portals:\u00a0Avoid entering more personal details than absolutely necessary on insurance or provider websites. Tools like \"Find a Doctor\" might log your search terms, so keep inputs vague when possible.",
      "2. Use privacy-focused browsers:\u00a0Browsers like Brave or Firefox offer built-in privacy protections, such as blocking third-party trackers that could expose health-related browsing activity.",
      "3. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Visit\u00a0Google\u2019s Ad Settings and disable ad personalization. This won\u2019t stop tracking, but it can reduce how your data is used for targeting.",
      "4. Opt out of tracking where possible:\u00a0Many healthcare sites use cookies and tracking tools. Choose \"reject all\" or the strictest privacy settings in cookie banners. If a tracking opt-out tool is available, use it.",
      "5. Read privacy policies (yes, really):\u00a0Look for language like \"third-party sharing,\" \"advertising,\" or \"analytics.\" If a healthcare provider mentions tools like Google Analytics or Meta Pixel, that\u2019s a cue to proceed cautiously.",
      "6. Monitor your accounts and credit:\u00a0Keep an eye out for unusual insurance claims or medical charges. Set up credit alerts or monitoring services if your provider offers them, especially after a breach.",
      "7. Ask questions:\u00a0Call or email your healthcare provider or insurer. Ask what tracking tools they use and how they protect your data. The more consumers push for transparency, the more pressure there is to improve standards.",

      "Bonus privacy steps (For extra peace of mind)",
      "If you want to go beyond the basics, here are some additional steps that can help reduce your digital footprint and catch misuse early:",
      "Use a personal data removal service:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Consider identity theft protection services:\u00a0If you\u2019re concerned about fraud or medical identity theft, you'll want to consider using identity theft protection services. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0To guard against malware or phishing attacks that could compromise access to your online health accounts, be sure to use strong antivirus software. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It baffles me how careless most companies are when it comes to protecting user data. Blue Shield \"mistakenly\" shared your data with Google, which then used it to show personalized ads. It took the company three years to realize this. While most cyber incidents involve an attacker, this breach didn\u2019t need one. We need accountability in data practices, especially when human error or tech oversight can cause damage at scale.",

      "It's considered the largest password compilation ever released.\u00a0With such a vast collection of breached credentials circulating, the risk of credential stuffing, identity theft and unauthorized access to online accounts and systems remains high.

      "Think of weak passwords as an open door for hackers. Recent reports show that many common passwords can be cracked in literally seconds. Simple or reused passwords are especially vulnerable to automated attacks, and once one account is breached, others are often quickly compromised.",
      "If a company you\u2019re signed up with experiences a\u00a0data breach and your login info is leaked, attackers can try that same password on other platforms, potentially unlocking a lot more than just one account.",
      "Strong passwords act as your first line of defense. They\u2019re long, complex and unique, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess or force their way in. When every account has its own strong password, even if one gets leaked, the rest stay safe.",
      "Think of it this way. A weak password is like using the same key for your house, car and office and leaving it under the doormat. A strong password? It\u2019s like a unique, high-security key for every door in your digital life.",

      "Adding numbers makes your password harder to crack. Instead of sticking to just letters \u2014 like \"Trkplmsh\" \u2014 try something like \"Tr8k5Plm2sh.\" Randomly placed numbers increase complexity and make your password much more secure.",

      "Symbols like !, @, #, and $ add another layer of security. For example, a password like \"T8g5K9w2\" becomes even stronger as \"T8g5#K9w2!.\" Special characters increase complexity and help defend against attacks.",
      "Reusing passwords is like handing hackers a master key. If one account gets breached, and you\u2019ve reused that password elsewhere, you\u2019re toast. One password, one purpose. No exceptions.",
      "Your name, birthday or \"Fluffy1990\" (your dog\u2019s name and birth year) might feel clever, but they\u2019re goldmines for attackers who can scrape social media or breached data. Keep it impersonal and unpredictable.",
      "Even good passwords can go stale. It\u2019s a smart move to update them every 90 days, or sooner if a site you use has a security issue.",

In a world full of data leaks, a strong, unique password is one of the easiest ways to protect yourself. So, what\u2019s your score? Think it\u2019s time to level up?",
      "What should I do if my password strength is low?",
      "If your score didn\u2019t quite hit that seven out of seven mark, no worries. The good news? You\u2019ve already taken the first step by identifying the weak spots. Now, you\u2019ve got two options:",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To keep your passwords secure, use ones that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common patterns. Always use a different password for each account, and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication whenever it's available.",
      "While you can build a strong password on your own, let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s not always easy. Coming up with something that\u2019s at least 12 characters long, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and isn\u2019t based on anything personal? That\u2019s a tall order. And even if you do manage to craft the perfect one, you\u2019ve still got to remember it, especially if you\u2019re using a different strong password for every account (which you absolutely should be).",
      "This is the easier, faster and frankly smarter route. A password generator creates long, complex, completely random passwords for you \u2014 no guesswork or mental gymnastics required. These tools are designed to pump out passwords that check all the boxes, making them far harder to crack. If you want an easy and secure option, many password managers include built-in password generators that follow best practices for maximum strength.",
      "Either way, the key takeaway is this: Don\u2019t settle for weak or recycled passwords. Whether you go DIY or use a tool, upgrading your password strength is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself online.",
      "Illustration of online banking login on laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the best password manager?",
      "Password security can seem like a tough thing to maintain manually. The good news is that password managers take the hassle out of it by generating, storing and autofilling strong, unique passwords for you.",
      "We recommend a password manager that is secure, user-friendly and includes features like a password health tool, data breach monitoring and a built-in password generator to help you create strong, unique passwords. Essentially, they are a digital safe designed to encrypt and store your login credentials, passkeys, credit card details, personal information and even sensitive files. It remembers everything for you, organizes your credentials neatly and fills in login forms with a single click. When you sign up for a new site, it autosaves the password with no effort required.",
      "The best part? A password manager puts an end to password reuse. Instead of leaning on that tired old \"Fluffy1990\" for every account, it generates strong, unique passwords tailored to each site, boosting security for both your personal and professional life. So, with a password manager, you\u2019ll no longer have to ask yourself, how secure is my password?",

      "With data breaches becoming increasingly common, it's clear that password security isn't a \"set it and forget it\" task. It's an ongoing process.

    "story": [
      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "Most companies use different vendors to run different parts of their business, such as customer management, finances, payroll and social media. To do this, they share access to customer data with these platforms. The issue is that not all vendors take cybersecurity seriously, and hackers are well aware of that.",
      "More and more, attackers are going after these weaker links in the digital supply chain. These kinds of breaches often happen quietly, exposing large amounts of customer information without touching a company\u2019s main systems. It\u2019s becoming a serious concern for both businesses and their customers.",
      "One of the latest cases involves Hertz, the car rental giant, which recently confirmed that customer data was exposed because of a cyberattack on one of its software vendors.",

      "What happened at Hertz?",
      "Hertz, the global car rental company that also operates Dollar and Thrifty, has\u00a0disclosed a data breach affecting thousands of its customers. The incident stems from a cyberattack on one of its third-party vendors, software provider Cleo, in October 2024 and December 2024. The breach did not compromise Hertz\u2019s internal systems directly but involved data that had been shared with the vendor as part of its operational workflow.",
      "The compromised data varies by region but includes sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact details, driver\u2019s license numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and other government-issued IDs. Certain financial information, including payment card details and workers\u2019 compensation claims, was also among the stolen records.",
      "In the U.S., disclosures were filed with regulatory bodies in California, Texas and Maine. Specifically, 3,457 individuals were affected in Maine and 96,665 in Texas. The total global impact, however, is believed to be far greater. Customers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand and the U.K. were also notified via breach notices on Hertz\u2019s regional websites.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach is believed to be the work of the Clop ransomware gang, a well-known Russia-linked hacking group. Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Cleo\u2019s enterprise file transfer software, technology used by many large organizations to securely transmit sensitive business data. In 2024, the gang launched a mass-hacking campaign targeting Cleo users, ultimately stealing data from more than 60 companies, including Hertz.",
      "Interestingly, while Hertz was named on Clop\u2019s dark web leak site in 2024, the company initially stated it had \"no evidence\" its systems or data had been compromised.",
      "When contacted by CyberGuy, a Hertz spokesperson said, \"At Hertz, we take the privacy and security of personal information seriously. This vendor event involves Cleo, a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. Importantly, to date, our forensic investigation has found no evidence that Hertz's own network was affected by this event. However, among many other companies affected by this event, we have confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo's platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\"",

      "What does this mean for customers?",
      "While Hertz\u2019s internal systems were not breached, the exposure of personal data, including driver\u2019s license numbers, contact details and government-issued IDs, poses serious risks. Affected individuals may be vulnerable to identity theft, fraudulent account openings and targeted\u00a0phishing attempts. If Social Security numbers were involved, the potential for harm increases significantly. Anyone who rented from Hertz, Dollar or Thrifty between October and December 2024 should be on high alert.",

      "1. Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks.

To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Hertz breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Hertz breach, including Social Security numbers, driver's license and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cyber risk doesn\u2019t always come from a company\u2019s own network. It often originates in unseen corners of the digital supply chain. Even as companies double down on internal cybersecurity, they must be equally rigorous in how they vet and monitor third-party vendors. For consumers, it\u2019s no longer enough to trust the big brand on the label. The data trail is wider, the attack surface larger and the consequences far more opaque.",

      "Many of these sketchy extensions presented themselves as tools for search assistance, ad-blocking, security monitoring or extension scanning but shared a connection to a single, unused domain, suggesting coordinated behavior. They all use the same code patterns, connect to some of the same servers and require the same list of sensitive systems permissions, including the ability to interact with web traffic on all URLs visited, access cookies, manage browser tabs and execute scripts.",
      "What\u2019s more concerning is that at least 10 of these extensions carried Google\u2019s \"Featured\" badge, implying vetting for trustworthiness.

With permissions to read tabs, access cookies, intercept web requests and inject scripts into pages, they can monitor nearly everything you do in your browser. This includes tracking your browsing activity, observing login sessions and altering the content of websites you visit, all without your knowledge.",
      "These extensions are not simply misconfigured tools. They appear to be intentionally designed with surveillance in mind. Many store their configuration data locally, which allows remote servers to update their behavior at any time. This setup is commonly seen in spyware, where changes can be made after installation without alerting the user. The code is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult for researchers to understand what the extensions are actually doing.",
      "In some cases, the extensions appear to do nothing at all when clicked. However, they continue to send data in the background. For instance, the Fire Shield Extension Protection remained inactive until the researcher manually triggered it with a specific extension ID. Only then did it begin to transmit browsing activity and other data, revealing behavior that would be hard for an average user to detect.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from sketchy extensions",
      "If you\u2019re worried about the above extensions, here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1)\u00a0Keep your browser up to date: Chrome gets regular updates that get rid of most security issues. Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2) Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",
      "3) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0A good antivirus can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5) Change your passwords and do it safely: If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via Chrome\u2019s built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer, where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then consider switching to a\u00a0password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward. I\u2019ve reviewed the top options in my\u00a0best password managers of 2025 guide. See which one fits your needs best.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The fact that several of these extensions carried Google\u2019s own \"Featured\" badge should serve as a wake-up call. It points to a serious lapse in oversight and raises concerns about how thorough Chrome\u2019s extension review process actually is. When millions of users unknowingly install spyware under the impression that it has been vetted and approved, the issue is no longer just about bad actors. It reflects a deeper failure within the platform itself. Google needs to take stronger responsibility by improving transparency and tightening its review standards.",

      "Compact fusion engine called the Dual Direct Fusion Drive (Pulsar Fusion) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What makes Sunbird special?",
      "Can you imagine a spacecraft that can reach speeds of almost 329,000 mph? That's what\u00a0Sunbird is aiming for.\u00a0This incredible speed is due to its nuclear fusion propulsion system. The Sunbird boasts a high specific impulse and an integrated 2 MW power system, making it a reusable transfer vehicle perfect for those deep-space missions that are currently out of reach.",

      "NEVER LOSE CELL SERVICE AGAIN WITH THIS SPACE-AGE SATELLITE TECH",
      "How does it work?",
      "The Dual Direct Fusion Drive is designed to produce thrust and continuous electrical power; think of it as the ultimate energy-efficient engine. It can deliver between 10,000 and 15,000 seconds of specific impulse while generating 2 megawatts of energy. What this really means is that missions can last longer and require much less fuel compared to traditional rockets.",

      "GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN",
      "What can Sunbird do?",
      "Sunbird has some pretty amazing potential uses; imagine it transporting 2,200-4,400 pounds of cargo to Mars in under six months, about 60 days faster than current systems, allowing crucial supplies to reach the Red Planet sooner. It could also carry probes to distant planets like Jupiter or Saturn in less than four years, all while powering scientific instruments in areas where solar energy is weak.",
      "As a reusable cislunar transport system, Sunbird can deliver up to 3,300 pounds of supplies to lunar orbit, which would support operations like fuel processing and spacecraft navigation. Sunbird could also facilitate trips to near-Earth asteroids for mining, reducing travel times and providing the power needed for drilling and material processing. Finally, it can deliver power to next-generation space telescopes in distant orbits, supporting cryogenics and real-time communications, opening up new possibilities for space observation.",

      "Slashing costs and energy requirements",
      "Getting to low Earth orbit is one of the most energy-intensive parts of space travel. Sunbird can stay stationed in orbit, allowing other spacecraft to dock and use the fusion engine for the rest of the journey. This could cut fuel storage needs by as much as 50% for missions to places like Mars or Jupiter.",
      "Compact fusion engine called the Dual Direct Fusion Drive (Pulsar Fusion) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "When can we expect to see Sunbird in action?",

Your sons and daughters are going to keep fighting. Most of the hostages are going to come home dead. The idea would be either to force Netanyahu to come on board with that or scramble Israeli politics and see if you could trigger elections. That's what people were saying, like, \u2018let's just break this up because it's not going anywhere good.\u2019\"",
      "However, Goldenberg said Biden blocked the move. \"I think at the end of the day, he [Biden] was uncomfortable with the idea of going out that directly against Netanyahu.\"",

By \"painstakingly follow[ing]\" the document, the lawsuit alleges defendants \"directly responded to, and followed orders from, Hamas.\"",

    "summary": "The former head of Project 2025 believes an \u201cunchained\u201d President Donald Trump has made immense progress during the first 100 days of his second term toward undoing liberal gains dating back to Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
    "story": [
      "The former head of Project 2025 believes an \u201cunchained\u201d President Donald Trump has made immense progress during the first 100 days of his second term toward undoing liberal gains dating back to Franklin D. Roosevelt.",
      "But Paul Dans \u2014 who led the effort to produce a detailed conservative transition plan and policy blueprint that was at the center of last year\u2019s presidential election \u2014 believes the president needs an influx of new attorneys to fight for his policies in court. Those battles, Dans told NBC News, will shape the next 100 days.",
      "\u201cIf Roosevelt had the New Deal, this is what I would think of as Trump\u2019s real deal,\u201d Dans said. \u201cThis is deconstructing the administrative state and walking back a lot of this progressive architecture that had been built up by FDR.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s coming next is really a squaring off with the courts,\u201d Dans said, adding, \u201cThis is going to reach, certainly, a boiling point, and so look to that getting resolved.\u201d",
      "The Dans-led Project 2025 was an effort overseen by the Heritage Foundation ahead of the 2024 campaign, which began with the basic premise of setting up a future right-wing administration to govern on Day 1 with more preparation and planning than Trump had for his first term. Much of Project 2025 centered on plans for radically restructuring the civil service, as well as providing a database of potential MAGA-inspired hires in a new administration.",
      "But it was a 900-plus-page memo, outlining many policy positions a future administration should consider, that garnered the most attention, as Democrats put it at the center of their campaign. Even though many of the policies included in the document mirrored policies Trump pledged to enact in his own plan, Agenda47, the president and his campaign distanced themselves from Project 2025 on the trail. And Dans, who worked in Trump\u2019s first administration, was forced out of his position over the summer as anger from the campaign intensified.",
      "After Trump won, however, he hired multiple authors of the report to key positions, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, immigration czar Tom Homan, top trade adviser Peter Navarro and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, among others. NBC News reported during the transition that the transition team was utilizing the Project 2025 database of potential hires, too.",
      "The blueprint ultimately foreshadowed plenty of what Trump has enacted or attempted once in power. An independent tracker found that the administration has completed or taken action on roughly 40% of the material in Project 2025\u2019s blueprint. That includes everything from cutting research grants to universities to readying cuts for climate research, stripping some immigrants of Temporary Protected Status, and an all-out assault on diversity programs in government.",
      "With that in the foreground as Trump hits the 100-day mark, Dans spoke with NBC News in a pair of interviews in recent days. He doesn\u2019t believe measuring Trump\u2019s actions against Project 2025\u2019s plan \u201cis really accurate,\u201d adding, \u201cthese are, to be sure, President Trump\u2019s own policies, many of which were embodied in Project 2025.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s with great excitement that I read what\u2019s going on every day and see a new step that they\u2019re taking,\u201d Dans said. \u201cBut to be sure, this has to get implemented. At this point, a lot of the executive orders and the like are policy pronouncements, and the real rubber is going to meet the road when it comes to implementing all these directives.\u201d",
      "With a tightly divided Congress passing few new laws, though, a number of Trump\u2019s executive initiatives \u2014\u00a0whether they be on immigration, the civil service or federal funding \u2014\u00a0are tied up in court battles that will be key in determining just how far the president is able to go.",
      "\u201cMany of us always saw this as the ultimate end game, that this is where the two sides would meet,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIt comes down to having the right people. Ultimately, you need to have zealous advocates for MAGA in position and ready to face off with their counterparts. \u2026 To be sure, this is where all the eyes are going to go next.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe needs additional reinforcements on his team,\u201d Dans said, \u201cas this kind of slows down into a war of attrition with the deep state, particularly on the legal front.\u201d He added: \u201cAs much as he can continue to get his team on the field, that\u2019s imperative.\u201d",
      "Personnel is policy",
      "On his Truth Social platform Monday, Trump posted that his administration has so far hired to fill more than 80% of political appointee positions in some of the largest agencies, including the departments of Justice, State, Defense and Treasury. Those positions make up a small number of the jobs in each agency, but Trump recently moved to reclassify a whole host of federal workers to make them easier to replace.",
      "The administration has already suffered some setbacks in court. The fallout over Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u2019s deportation to El Salvador began when the administration said in court filings that he was deported because of an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d Last week, the administration replaced its lawyers in a case challenging New York City\u2019s congestion pricing, after the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan said it mistakenly filed a memo that detailed weaknesses in the administration\u2019s argument and strategy.",
      "\u201cThis is where the worry comes in,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIs there enough of a MAGA elite among the top legal minds to meet\u201d the administration\u2019s needs?",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really incumbent on the administration to get a lot of these good lawyers who are out in the 50 states, get them to Washington and press them into service,\u201d Dans continued.",
      "Enhancing MAGA staffing has been front of mind for Dans for a long time, given how central deconstructing the existing federal bureaucracy was to Project 2025. That mission has been carried out by Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser who\u2019s overseen the effort dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s elementally important is that Project 2025 identified the administrative state as the major blockade to effectuating change for the better,\u201d Dans said.",
      "The Trump administration hasn\u2019t \u201cfired enough people, to be sure,\u201d he added, describing how difficult it is to do so under existing regulations. With Trump recently moving on the policy known as Schedule F \u2014 the reclassification of some career government employees to make them easier to remove \u2014 Dans said he expects to see \u201ca lot more of this taking place.\u201d",
      "Dans had plenty of praise for Musk and his effort, as the tech titan announced this month that he will soon dedicate more time to his business interests and decrease how much time he\u2019s spending in government.",
      "\u201cWithout DOGE, I don\u2019t believe any of this would be able to be accomplished at the pace it has been,\u201d Dans said, adding its structure remains necessary to achieve Trump\u2019s goals in the months to come. \u201cThis is a great 100-day mark, a watershed moment in history. This is the slamming of the door on the progressive era.\u201d",
      "But Dans did offer some caution on artificial intelligence policy, as Trump has sought to loosen restrictions around AI via executive orders while Musk and DOGE have implemented AI programs at some federal agencies.",
      "\u201cAI has produced this MRI of the blob, and now we can actually make connections that would have been impossible before, in a matter of a weekend, that might have taken two years of study,\u201d Dans said, adding, \u201cBut I do believe that AI needs to be carefully policed by the administration.\u201d",
      "\u2018Short-term pain, but all for long-term gain\u2019",
      "As Trump hits the 100-day mark of his administration, polling is flashing several warning signs for him on signature issues, like immigration and the economy, as deportations to a prison in El Salvador and the president\u2019s global tariffs garner headlines.",
      "Dans, though, says Trump is on target and maintains a mandate for \u201csweeping change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is Trump, unchained and able to do what he promised the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no playbook out there for restoring the country. Much of this is intuitive to him and to others. There are going to be ups and downs. It\u2019s a long-term proposition. So there will be some short-term pain, but all for long-term gain.\u201d",
      "Moving forward, Dans said he\u2019s eager to see more reforms at the Defense Department, including a \u201clarge repurposing\u201d of the agency as it sharpens its focus on Asia, which he believes is coming once there\u2019s a settlement in Ukraine. He also wants to see Trump take action on a policy he proposed during the campaign but has gotten little attention in recent months: the construction of 10 \u201cfreedom cities\u201d on federal land.",
      "\u201cI always thought that was an intriguing Trump idea,\u201d Dans said. \u201cIt captures the imagination of everybody to build something new. He\u2019s a builder. So the first part of building is demolition, but he\u2019s going to get on to the construction phase pretty soon.\u201d",
      "Looking ahead to 2028, Dans said there won\u2019t be a need for a Project 2029.",
      "\u201cWe have President Trump in power now, he has a team,\u201d Dans said. \u201cThe premise of Project 2025 was that we needed, as conservatives, to get together. We were a herd of cats, often scratching at one another, and we needed to kind of start marching in the line. And that\u2019s what Project 2025 did.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I think, not only our initiative, but other presidential transition projects really put this forward that time was of the essence,\u201d Dans continued. \u201cAnd President Trump has certainly come out and played with an urgency that is 100% correct.\u201d"

      "Jordon Hudson, the 24-year-old who drew national attention Sunday after CBS aired an awkward interview with her boyfriend, 73-year-old former NFL coach Bill Belichick, added another layer of intrigue to the relationship Tuesday with a post on Instagram.",
      "Hudson posted what appeared to be a screenshot of an email Belichick sent on April 10. In the email, Belichick expresses frustration with the media tour accompanying the release of his memoir, \u201cThe Art of Winning: Lessons from My Life in Football,\u201d and takes issue with an unspecified news article that highlighted a professional mistake he mentions in the book.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is fantastic, but it probably will hype the book, which is clearly the ongoing theme here,\u201d Belichick wrote. \u201cThis is about what I expected from the media.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis book is about how I did my job, and lessons from my 50 years in and around the NFL \u2014 not a bathroom book that highlights my mistakes,\u201d he added. \u201cI hope we can get on the same page in promoting the book authentically.\u201d",
      "Belichick's email does not specify the professional mistake or the news publication that highlighted it.",
      "In a seven-word caption accompanying the post, Hudson said: \u201cFull statement to be released later today.\u201d She has more than 91,000 followers on Instagram, where she describes herself as the daughter of a Maine fisherman and a former college cheerleader.",
      "Belichick\u2019s book tour evidently included the interview with \u201cCBS Sunday Morning\u201d that aired Sunday.

      "The interview quickly went viral online, driving speculation about the origins of the relationship and the nature of Hudson\u2019s role in Belichick\u2019s professional life. In a voiceover track, Dokoupil told viewers that \u201cJordan was a constant presence during our interview.\u201d He quoted Belichick describing Hudson in his memoir as his \u201cidea mill and creative muse.\u201d",
      "Dokoupil also asked Belichick about photos of the couple on Instagram, including a post in October featuring him in fisherman\u2019s gear and her dressed like a mermaid. In response, the famously taciturn Belichick said: \u201cI\u2019m on some of those social media platforms, but I honestly don\u2019t follow them.\u201d",
      "CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",

      "Belichick is best known for leading the New England Patriots to six Super Bowl championships. He left the NFL after the 2023 season and, late last year, signed a deal to coach the football team at the University of North Carolina. A spokesman for the UNC team did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

      "SB 700, also known as the Florida Farm Bill, doesn't mention the word \"fluoride,\" but it would effectively ban the chemical compound by preventing \"the use of certain additives in a water system.\" The bill awaits Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 signature.",
      "If DeSantis, a Republican, signs the bill, Florida will become the second state to ban fluoride from water supplies.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, signed a bill in late March that prohibits any person or government entity from\u00a0adding the cavity-fighting mineral to the state\u2019s water systems, making it the first state to do so. It will go into effect May 7.",
      "During a Florida House session Tuesday, supporters of the bill argued that fluoride doesn\u2019t improve water quality and that removing it from water systems could save local governments money. Opponents argued that everyday Floridians rely on fluoride for dental health.",
      "\"This bill doesn\u2019t hurt the wealthy. They\u2019ll keep seeing private dentists, getting their expensive treatments and flashing their perfect smiles,\" Democratic Rep. Daryl Campbell said during the session. \"But for everyday Floridians, the people who clock in at 6 a.m., who can\u2019t take time off \u2014\u00a0off for their dental visits, who rely on water from their taps to protect their kids, this bill takes a safe and proven and affordable public health tool and rips it away.\"",
      "Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, a Democrat, said in a statement that she was \"deeply disappointed\" by the Legislature's decision to ban fluoride, which she said \"disregards the overwhelming consensus of dentists, doctors, and medical experts and will end a practice that has been in place for decades to protect our health.\"",

      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement has indicated it could start terminating a person\u2019s legal status because of visa revocation.",
      "An internal memo to all Student and Exchange Visitor Program personnel, which falls under ICE, shows an expanded list of criteria for ICE to terminate foreign-born students\u2019 legal status in the U.S., including a \u201cU.S. Department of State Visa Revocation (Effective Immediately).\u201d It was filed in court by the Justice Department on Monday night and dated Saturday.",
      "Previously, there were a variety of reasons for students to lose legal status, including if they stop attending school, lose work authorization or commit certain crimes. But typically students would have the right to due process before the legal status is terminated, attorneys say. Now, according to the memo, visa revocation itself is grounds for the termination of status.",
      "The memo shows expansion of power for ICE. Houston-based immigration attorney Steven Brown said the new policy \u201cagainst at least 15 years of SEVP guidance,\u201d referring to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which falls under ICE.",
      "\u201cHistorically, the Department of State has revoked visas for many reasons,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t impact your non-immigrant status in the US. It\u2019s just now they\u2019re trying to do that part of it.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration announced Friday at a hearing that the legal statuses of international students whose records were terminated in recent weeks would be restored. In the meantime, the Trump administration said ICE would craft a new policy that will \u201cprovide a framework for status record termination.\u201d",
      "According to the memo, SEVIS records can now be terminated for a number of reasons, ranging from \u201cexceeded unemployment time\u201d to \u201cviolation of change of status requirements.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen SEVP has objective evidence that a nonimmigrant visa holder is no longer complying with the terms of their nonimmigrant status for any reason, then the SEVIS record may be terminated on that basis,\u201d the memo said.",
      "Using its discretion, ICE can also conduct further investigations or initiate removal proceedings based on that evidence.",
      "The memo affirmed an existing rule that the State Department can \u201cat any time, in its discretion, revoke an alien\u2019s visa.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen State revokes an alien\u2019s visa with immediate e\ufb00ect, ICE should take steps to initiate removal proceedings,\u201d the memo said. \u201cIf State revokes a nonimmigrant visa e\ufb00ective immediately, SEVP may terminate the nonimmigrant\u2019s SEVIS record based on the visa revocation with immediate e\ufb00ect.\u201d",
      "The memo underscored that the document cannot be used as a substitute for applicable legal requirements.",
      "\u201cIt is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter,\u201d the memo said.",
      "In March, the Trump administration began revoking the visas of thousands of international students in addition to their records and legal statuses. Critics said the administration appeared to be taking aim at those who\u2019ve participated in political activism or have had previous charges, like DUIs.",
      "After many successful legal challenges to the terminations across the U.S., many international students began to discover that their records were abruptly restored last week, immigration attorneys and universities said. The reinstatements occurred with little to no explanation, the attorneys said. And as of Tuesday, several universities, including Northeastern University, Harvard University and the University of Connecticut, reported that all students affected by the terminations had their statuses restored.",
      "Jath Shao, a Cleveland-based immigration attorney who\u2019s represented several international students affected by the visa revocations, said that the new policy presents a new set of challenges for students.",
      "\u201cICE has now done their homework and issued this memo to give themselves the power that judges just told them they didn\u2019t have,\u201d Shao said. \u201cStudents should be concerned that even minor problems can have serious consequences and should consult a lawyer if there is anything in their past to worry about.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "To celebrate the first 100 days of his second term in office, President Donald Trump went back to his greatest hits.",
      "At a rally Tuesday in Warren, Michigan, commemorating the early marker of his second term, Trump leaned into much of the rhetoric that became a staple of his campaign rallies, hitting on major themes like the economy and immigration even as his poll numbers are among the worst of any president at this point in office.",
      "\u201cI miss the campaign,\u201d Trump told a raucous crowd, lamenting that he no longer gets to regularly hold rally-style events with his most loyal political supporters.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Recent public polling has found Trump\u2019s approval rating consistently in the low-to-mid-40s, numbers at odds with the rosy portrayal he gave in his Michigan stop.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s focus on illegal immigration and the border has consistently been his highest-performing policy issue, but his plan to implement sweeping tariffs has roiled global markets and gotten poor marks; a recent CNBC poll found that 57% of respondents believe the United States is either headed to recession or already in one.",
      "But Trump, in characteristic fashion Tuesday, cast his first three months in office as a universal success.",
      "It has been \u201cthe most successful first 100 days of administration in the history of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s according to many, many people.\u201d",
      "Cheri Verardi, who attended the event, said: \u201cHe is doing what needs to be done. It\u2019s hard for some people to swallow, but we need to see how it will play out. And I believe it\u2019s going to play out for the betterment of our country.\u201d",
      "Deborah Spencer, another rally attendee, said she doesn\u2019t like how she has so far \u201clost money for retirement\u201d as the markets have dropped because of Trump\u2019s economic policies. But she said she still has faith in him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m confident that President Trump has our best interests,\u201d she said.",
      "Thousands attended the rally, but the overall size of the event paled in comparison with past campaign-era Trump rallies. Trump referred to \"all the people outside,\" even as the venue itself wasn\u2019t at capacity.",
      "Trump\u2019s second term has been marked with fights with federal courts, many of which have ruled against some of his most controversial policies, and it has ushered in an eroding relationship between the United States and some of its closest global allies. It has also sought to overhaul the federal government with the help of tech billionaire Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has ushered in mass layoffs of government workers.",
      "During his second term, Trump's MAGA base has brushed off concerns about tariffs as \u201cshort-term pain\u201d and embraced his border policies, while Democrats have amplified their concerns about what they say are his authoritarian tendencies as his administration has focused on mass deportations.",
      "Trump brushed off the low polling numbers stemming from some of his early administration policies as \u201cfake.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it were a legit poll, it would be in the 60s or 70s,\u201d he said Tuesday.",
      "Holding the rally in Michigan itself points to the state's importance in next year's midterm elections. Democratic Sen. Gary Peters isn\u2019t seeking re-election, making Michigan one of the top Senate-side battleground states headed into 2026. Trump hasn\u2019t endorsed a candidate in the race; Republican leadership in the Senate has backed Mike Rogers, who lost last year's race to Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin.",
      "In a twist, Trump also used the day to find some common ground with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat and persistent Trump critic who is considering running for president in 2028. At an event hours before the rally in Warren, Trump announced a new series of fighter jets for Selfridge Air National Guard Base, giving the credit to Whitmer, whose recent visit to the White House to discuss tariffs drew criticism from many in her own party.",
      "At the rally, Trump focused one of his attacks on Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., who introduced articles of impeachment against Trump on Monday, saying he is a \u201cclear and present danger to our nation\u2019s Constitution and democracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat the hell did I do? Here we go again,\u201d said Trump, whom the House twice impeached during his first term. \u201cI had the television way down, and I said to our great first lady, \u2018Listen, did I just hear us being impeached again?\u2019\u201d",
      "Trump advisers have told NBC News they don't see Democrats\u2019 retaking the House, but they continue to talk about the idea of Democrats\u2019 trying to impeach Trump as a voter turnout mechanism headed into the 2026 midterms.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats are not taking the House,\" a Trump adviser said Tuesday. \"But this is about making sure voters remember the stakes of the midterm elections.\u201d"

      "\"I felt taken aback, humiliated,\" Haley said.",
      "Asked by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg whether she had any interest in Weinstein \u201cromantically or sexually,\" Haley replied: \u201cNo, I did not. I was there to try and find work.\u201d",
      "Still, despite being rebuffed, Weinstein did arrange for her to work on \"Project Runway\" even though she lacked a U.S. work visa, Haley said before court was adjourned for the day.",
      "Haley is expected to be back on the stand Wednesday and reprise her 2020 testimony about the alleged assault.",
      "During the 2020 trial, Haley testified that not long after she finished working for the show, she visited Weinstein at his lower Manhattan apartment, where, she said, he pinned her down on his bed and forced oral sex on her.",
      "On the stand, Haley told jurors that in the midst of the alleged assault it occurred to her, \u201cI\u2019m being raped.\u201d",
      "Unsure what to do, Haley said, she weighed her options.",
      "\u201cIf I scream \u2018rape,\u2019 will someone hear me?\u201d she said. \u201cI checked out and decided to endure it.\u201d",
      "Haley testified at the retrial a week after her former roommate and close friend Christine Pressman told jurors that Haley confided in her back in September 2006 that Weinstein had assaulted her.",
      "\u201cI was staying at Lorne Michaels\u2019 house in East Hampton, and Miriam was there, as well,\" Pressman said, referring to the \"Saturday Night Live\" creator. \"She was distraught, crying, very upset, obviously; she was very animated and had a lot of intensity. She said it\u2019s Harvey Weinstein. She was in shock. She described what happened, and it was disgusting.\"",
      "Asked what she advised her friend, Pressman said: \"I told her to move past it and not to go to the police at all. I told her she should not to go to police or the authorities about being raped by Harvey Weinstein.\"",
      "Another former roommate, Elizabeth Entin, said Haley also told her Weinstein assaulted her. But she said she gave Haley different guidance.",
      "\u201cHe raped my friend, and I am not happy about that,\u201d Entin said. \u201cI told her to call a lawyer to navigate the system. I despise anyone who has raped my friend. She is not my only friend that has been raped.\"",
      "In her opening remarks, Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey said Weinstein was a serial sexual predator who used his power as \"a titan\" in the movie industry to prey on young women, and she then described in graphic terms what he is alleged to have done to them.",
      "\u201cThey stayed quiet for years,\u201d Lucey said of the accusers, out of \u201ctheir fear of what he might do to them.\u201d",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, insisted in his opening statement that Weinstein\u2019s sexual encounters with the accusers were \u201ctransactional\" and \u201cconsensual.\u201d",
      "\"The casting couch is not a crime scene,\" he said."

      "In recent months, a group of researchers conducted a secret experiment on Reddit to see how artificial intelligence can be used to influence human opinion. Now, Reddit says it is considering legal action.",
      "Researchers from the University of Zurich deployed a slew of AI bots posing as real people and engaging with users without their knowledge or consent to try to change minds on the popular Reddit forum r/changemyview, where posts often ask users to challenge their views on contentious topics.",
      "The bots, whose accounts are now banned, left more than 1,000 comments throughout the subreddit, taking on identities such as a rape victim, a Black man who opposes the Black Lives Matter movement and a trauma counselor who specializes in abuse.",
      "One AI bot, under the username u/catbaLoom213, left a lengthy comment arguing against the opinion that AI should never interact with humans on social media, according to a full copy of the bots\u2019 comments compiled by the subreddit\u2019s moderators.",
      "\u201cAI in social spaces isn\u2019t just about impersonation \u2014 it\u2019s about augmenting human connection,\u201d the bot wrote while impersonating a real user.",

      "While the results of the experiment are unclear, the project is the latest incident to fuel fears about the ability of AI to mimic humans online, adding to already prevalent concerns about the potential consequences of interacting with AI companions. Such bots, which have permeated social platforms like Instagram, are known to take on unique humanlike identities and personalities.",
      "On Monday, Reddit\u2019s chief legal officer, Ben Lee, wrote in a post that neither Reddit nor the r/changemyview mods knew about \u201cthis improper and highly unethical experiment\u201d ahead of time.

      "A spokesperson for Reddit declined to share additional comment.",
      "In an announcement to the community over the weekend, moderators of r/changemyview wrote that they filed an ethics complaint asking the university to advise against publishing the researchers\u2019 findings, to conduct an internal review of the study\u2019s approval and to commit to stronger oversight of such projects.",

      "She confirmed that the researchers have decided \u201con their own accord\u201d\u00a0not to publish the results. For privacy reasons, she added, the university cannot disclose their identities.",
      "Nyfeler said that because the study was considered \u201cexceptionally challenging,\u201d the ethics committee advised the researchers to inform the participants \u201cas much as possible\u201d\u00a0and to fully comply with Reddit\u2019s rules. But the recommendations\u00a0are not legally binding, she wrote, and the researchers are responsible for their project.",
      "Reached at an email address they set up for the experiment, the researchers directed all inquiries to the university.",
      "The researchers, who answered questions from the community via their Reddit account, u/LLMResearchTeam, said online that the AI bots personalized their responses by using a separate model to collect demographic information about users \u2014 such as their ages, genders, ethnicities, locations and political orientations \u2014 based on their post histories.",

      "Whitmer, who is viewed as a likely presidential contender in 2028, has come under scrutiny from Democrats in recent weeks for cultivating a closer working relationship with Trump.",
      "She pitched Trump this month on securing a new fighter mission for the base, which is home to a soon-to-be-retired fleet of jets. But the meeting led to an awkward moment in the Oval Office, where Whitmer later stood as Trump signed an executive order targeting a critic and repeated his debunked claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.",
      "A New York Times photographer captured her at one point shielding her face with folders.",
      "\"That's the reason she came to see me, by the way \u2014 to save Selfridge,\" Trump said Tuesday at the base in Macomb County at an event Whitmer attended.",
      "Trump, who is holding a rally Tuesday evening in nearby Warren, announced that a new fighter mission of about 20 F-15EX jets will replace the A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft at the base. He praised a bipartisan lobbying effort that included Republicans such as Rep. John James, who represents the area in Congress and is running for governor next year. But he repeatedly singled out Whitmer and thanked her for bringing the issue to his attention.",
      "He even brought Whitmer onstage at the end of his remarks, seemingly catching her off-guard.",
      "\"Well, I hadn\u2019t planned to speak, but I\u2019m \u2014 on behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country and serve so honorably, on behalf of the state of Michigan, I am really damn happy we\u2019re here to celebrate this recapitalization at Selfridge. It\u2019s crucial for the Michigan economy. It\u2019s crucial for the men and women here for our homeland security and our future. So thank you. I am so, so grateful that this announcement was made today, and I appreciate all the work. Thank you,\" Whitmer said.",

      "\u201cThis is a huge, bipartisan win for Michigan, decades in the making, that will grow our economy and make our country safer,\u201d she said in the statement. \u201cI appreciate the President\u2019s partnership on this new fighter mission that will protect jobs and show the world that Michigan is the best place to pioneer the next innovations in national defense.\u201d",
      "Trump's announcement was the second of the day geared toward Michigan, a major industrial state and Midwest battleground that he won by a slim margin last fall. Earlier Monday, the White House confirmed a tariff break for U.S. automakers, though the immediate impact on Detroit's Big 3 car manufacturers remains murky.",
      "A fraught political dynamic hung over the day.",
      "Whitmer \u2014 conscious of her national profile in a Democratic Party searching for new leadership and of the many Democrats who were angered by her unwitting cameo in a White House photo opportunity just weeks ago \u2014 sought to calibrate expectations around her appearance with Trump.",
      "This time, her team moved to get ahead of any fallout, confirming early Tuesday that she would be with Trump at the air base \u2014 \u201cto support her troops and the long-standing effort she has made to secure support for Selfridge,\u201d a spokesperson said. The statement emphasized that she would not attend Trump\u2019s rally nearby.",
      "Whitmer also issued a series of social media posts meant to explain her scheduled meeting with Trump before it happened.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll work with anyone who\u2019s serious about getting things done. But I\u2019ll never compromise on what I believe,\u201d she said on X. \u201cIn Michigan, we know how to get things done \u2014 and that means working together.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cBipartisanship isn\u2019t about sacrificing our values. It\u2019s about standing strong and finding common ground to get things done. It\u2019s about putting people first, every single time.\u201d",
      "Chris Meagher, a Democratic strategist and former Whitmer adviser, said Tuesday's announcement validates Whitmer's strategy for dealing with Trump.",
      "\"Gov. Whitmer has showed she\u2019s not afraid to stand up to Donald Trump when he\u2019s wrong for Michigan and work with him when it\u2019s best for Michigan,\" Meagher said. \"And she absolutely did what was best for the state of Michigan by working across the aisle on this deal. And she got the job done and deserves all the credit.\""

      "Trump signed a tidal wave of executive orders, but not new laws, in his first 100 days",
      "President Donald Trump has leaned heavily on executive power, rather than the Republican-controlled Congress, in his bid to drastically reshape the federal government in his first 100 days in office.",
      "Trump has signed 140 executive orders so far in his second term, far outpacing his recent predecessors. In fact, Trump issued more executive orders in the first 10 days of his term than any president did in their first 100 days since Dwight Eisenhower.",
      "That has largely left members of the House and Senate on the sidelines. Trump has so far signed just five bills into law, fewer than any president in the first 100 days of an administration since at least Eisenhower, according to an NBC News analysis of data in the congressional record. By this time during his first term, Trump had signed 30 bills into law. At the same point, Barack Obama had signed 14 while Joe Biden had signed 11.",
      "And the laws Trump has enacted are relatively limited in scope. As Sahil Kapur and Scott Wong note, three of them are measures to terminate regulations established by Biden. Another is a stopgap bill to keep the government funded for six months. And one is a strict immigration detention measure called the Laken Riley Act.",
      "While the government funding and immigration measures ultimately received some Democratic support, none of these measures were crafted on a bipartisan basis.",
      "Trump is expected to soon sign a sixth bill into law, the \u201cTake It Down Act,\u201d which criminalizes the publication of nonconsensual, sexually explicit images and videos, including those generated by artificial intelligence. The House overwhelmingly passed it Monday night, sending it to Trump\u2019s desk.",
      "And GOP lawmakers are working on crafting a multitrillion-dollar bill, which will include an extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts, a boost in immigration enforcement and military spending, and a debt ceiling hike.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t signed many bills into law because the agenda of the first 100 days has not been a legislative agenda at all,\u201d said William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, D.C. \u201cClearly, the administration, before it took office, planned a whirlwind of activity for the first 100 days at a pace that was compatible only with executive action. And this is part of an effort not only to overwhelm doubters and opponents through shock and awe tactics, but also to permanently expand executive power,\u201d Galston said.",

      "How Trump\u2019s 100-day standing in the polls compares to recent presidents",
      "As the 100th day of his new presidential term arrives, Donald Trump\u2019s poll numbers look an awful lot like they did 100 days into his last one.",
      "His job approval rating, according to an average of 16 independent national polls conducted over the last two weeks, sits at 43%. That\u2019s exactly where it sat in April of 2017, placing both Trump administrations at the bottom of the list of modern presidents at this same point.",
      "In his first term, there was limited fluctuation to Trump\u2019s average daily approval rating. It dipped as low as 38% and reached as high as 47%. That\u2019s a significantly narrower range than for any of his modern predecessors. So while his current mark is by no means strong, it\u2019s also par for the course for a president who has won two of the three national elections he\u2019s contested. In other words, these are numbers that Trump and his fellow Republicans are quite accustomed to.",
      "What is different from his first term, though, is how Americans view Trump\u2019s handling of specific issues.",
      "Clearly, tariffs and inflation stand out as Trump\u2019s biggest liabilities. This is in contrast to his first term, when Trump\u2019s handling of the economy generally won him his highest marks from voters, and when inflation wasn\u2019t pronounced enough to loom as a major concern in polling. That both inflation and the potential ripple effects of tariffs can be felt in voters\u2019 wallets makes those numbers that much more ominous for Trump and his party.",
      "There\u2019s another notable shift from Trump\u2019s first term involving the opposition party. While Trump\u2019s Republican Party is far from popular right now, Democrats actually are faring worse. In the average of recent national polls, 44% view the GOP favorably, while 55% view it unfavorably. But for Democrats, the split is 40% favorable and 59% unfavorable. During Trump\u2019s first term, Democrats consistently rated higher than the GOP.",

    "story": [
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement has indicated it could start terminating a person\u2019s legal status because of visa revocation.",
      "An internal memo to all Student and Exchange Visitor Program personnel, which falls under ICE, shows an expanded list of criteria for ICE to terminate foreign-born students\u2019 legal status in the U.S., including a \u201cU.S. Department of State Visa Revocation (Effective Immediately).\u201d It was filed in court by the Justice Department on Monday night and dated Saturday.",
      "Previously, there were a variety of reasons for students to lose legal status, including if they stop attending school, lose work authorization or commit certain crimes. But typically students would have the right to due process before the legal status is terminated, attorneys say. Now, according to the memo, visa revocation itself is grounds for the termination of status.",
      "The memo shows expansion of power for ICE. Houston-based immigration attorney Steven Brown said the new policy \u201cagainst at least 15 years of SEVP guidance,\u201d referring to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which falls under ICE.",
      "\u201cHistorically, the Department of State has revoked visas for many reasons,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t impact your non-immigrant status in the US. It\u2019s just now they\u2019re trying to do that part of it.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration announced Friday at a hearing that the legal statuses of international students whose records were terminated in recent weeks would be restored. In the meantime, the Trump administration said ICE would craft a new policy that will \u201cprovide a framework for status record termination.\u201d",
      "According to the memo, SEVIS records can now be terminated for a number of reasons, ranging from \u201cexceeded unemployment time\u201d to \u201cviolation of change of status requirements.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen SEVP has objective evidence that a nonimmigrant visa holder is no longer complying with the terms of their nonimmigrant status for any reason, then the SEVIS record may be terminated on that basis,\u201d the memo said.",
      "Using its discretion, ICE can also conduct further investigations or initiate removal proceedings based on that evidence.",
      "The memo affirmed an existing rule that the State Department can \u201cat any time, in its discretion, revoke an alien\u2019s visa.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen State revokes an alien\u2019s visa with immediate e\ufb00ect, ICE should take steps to initiate removal proceedings,\u201d the memo said. \u201cIf State revokes a nonimmigrant visa e\ufb00ective immediately, SEVP may terminate the nonimmigrant\u2019s SEVIS record based on the visa revocation with immediate e\ufb00ect.\u201d",
      "The memo underscored that the document cannot be used as a substitute for applicable legal requirements.",
      "\u201cIt is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter,\u201d the memo said.",
      "In March, the Trump administration began revoking the visas of thousands of international students in addition to their records and legal statuses. Critics said the administration appeared to be taking aim at those who\u2019ve participated in political activism or have had previous charges, like DUIs.",
      "After many successful legal challenges to the terminations across the U.S., many international students began to discover that their records were abruptly restored last week, immigration attorneys and universities said. The reinstatements occurred with little to no explanation, the attorneys said. And as of Tuesday, several universities, including Northeastern University, Harvard University and the University of Connecticut, reported that all students affected by the terminations had their statuses restored.",
      "Jath Shao, a Cleveland-based immigration attorney who\u2019s represented several international students affected by the visa revocations, said that the new policy presents a new set of challenges for students.",
      "\u201cICE has now done their homework and issued this memo to give themselves the power that judges just told them they didn\u2019t have,\u201d Shao said. \u201cStudents should be concerned that even minor problems can have serious consequences and should consult a lawyer if there is anything in their past to worry about.\u201d"

      "The Arizona state legislature approved a pair of bills on Monday that could pave the way for the creation of the country\u2019s first-ever state Bitcoin reserve.",
      "The fate of the bills, which mimic President Donald Trump\u2019s moves on the national level, is now in the hands of Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs.",
      "The pair of bills, both spearheaded by Republicans and passed largely along partisan lines through the state House and Senate, would allow the state to invest up to 10% of its public funds in digital assets like bitcoin. According to a 2023 audit, Arizona holds more than $30 billion in state-managed assets.",
      "If Hobbs signs them into law, Arizona becomes the first state in the nation to have its own cryptocurrency reserve. If Hobbs uses her veto power on the bills, they\u2019re dead.",
      "NBC News reached out to Hobbs\u2019 office for comment on how she plans to proceed with the bills. A spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Republican state Sen. Wendy Rogers, who sponsored one of the pieces of legislation, said it\u2019s in the governor\u2019s best interest to sign the legislation into law. \u201cCrypto and bitcoin have a huge following nationwide and in Arizona. They are wildly popular with the youth and independents,\u201d said Rogers, adding: \u201cI certainly hope she signs it because she can take credit and it will make her look good.\u201d",
      "The passage of these bills in the Arizona state legislature follows President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of a \u201cstrategic crypto reserve\u201d in March. But Trump\u2019s announcement bothered some cryptocurrency supporters after the president posted on his social media platform that the reserve will include lesser-known cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin that are more prone to volatility.",
      "Barrett Marson, a Republican political consultant based in Phoenix, said GOP members of the Arizona state legislature are taking their cues from the President. \u201cArizona Republicans are nothing if not attuned to what Trump is doing and always finding a way to replicate that here in the state,\u201d said Marson.",
      "Marson isn\u2019t sure if Hobbs will sign the bills into law or veto them, but he believes crypto\u2019s mercurial nature is likely a consideration. \u201cGov. Hobbs will undoubtedly consider how volatile bitcoin can be when she decides whether to sign or veto this effort,\u201d said Marson.",
      "But Rogers isn\u2019t concerned. \u201cI do not have any concerns about the volatility of bitcoin simply because if you zoom out on all of the charts, it always increases in value,\u201d Rogers said, before arguing that bitcoin is a \u201chedge against inflation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t speak for the other cryptocurrencies as those need to be analyzed on an individual basis,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Gerry Connolly\u2019s surprise announcement that he plans to soon step down as the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee has set off a scramble to succeed him that could pit the party's old guard against an up-and-coming class of progressives who have aggressively opposed President Donald Trump.",
      "Connolly, 75, said Monday that his esophageal cancer had returned after \u201cgrueling treatments\u201d and that he would not seek re-election next year. The Virginia Democrat's decision came just four months after he defeated Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., for the highly visible committee post.",
      "If Democrats retake the House in next year's midterm elections, the ranking member would be in line to chair the committee, with the power to issue subpoenas to the Trump administration.",
      "A senior Democrat on the panel, Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, said Tuesday that he is taking over as interim ranking member and will handle day-to-day responsibilities as Connolly focuses on his health. And Lynch said that Connolly has pledged to endorse him for the role once it formally opens up.",
      "\u201cHe told me he\u2019s publicly supporting me,\u201d said Lynch, 70, who has served in the House since 2001. \"I worked with him for almost 25 years. So we've traveled together \u2014 Iraq, Afghanistan \u2014 we've done investigations, we've worked on a whole bunch of stuff together. There's a friendship there.\"",
      "A handful of progressives on the panel \u2014 Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., 48; Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., 76; Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., 28; and Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, 44 \u2014 have been reaching out to colleagues and expressing interest in the Oversight Committee post, lawmakers told NBC News.",
      "But Democrats said there is one person who could clear the field of progressives if she decides to seek the position: Ocasio-Cortez. The 35-year-old New York Democrat, who has millions of followers on social media, is raising massive amounts of campaign cash and is quietly building support inside the Capitol, left the Oversight Committee this year for a spot on the Energy and Commerce Committee.",
      "Frost, who supported Ocasio-Cortez's oversight bid last year, told NBC News Tuesday he is interested in the job if it becomes vacant. But Frost said he would endorse Ocasio-Cortez if she decided to run. Other progressives looking at the post said they would rally behind Ocasio-Cortez, too.",
      "\u201cWe would coalesce around her,\u201d said one progressive member of the Oversight Committee.",
      "It would not be a simple process for Ocasio-Cortez to run for the position, though. To rejoin the Oversight Committee, Ocasio-Cortez would need the House Democratic caucus to grant her a waiver, which are sometimes given out in special circumstances.",
      "And Ocasio-Cortez has not yet given any indication that she wants the job or plans to seek the waiver. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In recent weeks, she\u2019s been criss-crossing the country with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., attracting huge crowds for their \u201cFighting Oligarchy\" tour and fueling speculation she\u2019s gearing up for a potential 2028 presidential campaign.",
      "The Oversight Committee job could boost Ocasio-Cortez's national ambitions, handing her a formal platform to investigate and keep the heat on the Trump administration.",
      "Lynch pushed back on the idea that Ocasio-Cortez could easily be granted a waiver to seek the post.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not on the committee, under the rules, it makes it very difficult to run,\u201d Lynch said.",
      "Democratic leaders haven't weighed in, arguing that there is no opening yet since Connolly technically remains the ranking member and is still a member of Congress.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no vacancy in the Oversight Committee. \u2026 That\u2019s our position,\u201d Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the chair of the House Democratic caucus, told reporters after a closed-door meeting of Democrats where Lynch made a presentation about the Oversight Committee's efforts.",
      "Many of those who are eyeing a potential bid declined to comment on the future race, saying they are focusing on supporting Connolly.",
      "\u201cHe and his family are in my thoughts and prayers. I am focused on the work of the committee and am hopeful Rep. Connolly will recover and be back,\u201d Khanna told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Mfume also said he was focusing his thoughts on Connolly, saying they had worked closely on the Oversight Committee and on issues central to Virginia and Maryland.",
      "\u201cMy comments are my heartfelt comments for my friend Gerry. And I think it\u2019s just too early to be talking about what happens next,\u201d Mfume said in an interview. \u201cWhen I say he\u2019s a dear friend, he really, really is. So I\u2019ll leave a speculation up to everybody else right now. For me, my priority is making sure that Gerry knows how much he\u2019s appreciated.\u201d",
      "Mfume represents the seat formerly held by the late Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who served as ranking member and chairman of the Oversight Committee during Trump's first term.",
      "Several Democrats have held the party's top position on the committee since Cummings' death in October 2019. Then-Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., who was the most senior Democrat on the panel, became interim chairman and eventually ran against Connolly, Lynch and then-Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., for the post.",
      "Speier and Lynch ultimately dropped their bids, and Maloney easily defeated Connolly. But Maloney eventually lost her primary race in 2022 in New York due to redistricting, once again opening up the Oversight Committee post.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who built a national profile during Trump's impeachments and the Jan. 6 hearings, soundly defeated Connolly for the oversight post. But after the 2024 elections, Raskin decided to run for a different job on the Judiciary Committee. The third time was the charm for Connolly, who beat back a challenge from Ocasio-Cortez in a closed-door, secret-ballot vote, 131-84.",
      "That battle, like many that have occurred within the Democratic Party following Trump's 2024 victory, centered on the idea of generational change.",
      "Speaking to reporters, Lynch argued that experience should count for something.",
      "The committee has \u201cgot more younger members, newer members, who have moved up quickly in this committee,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cSo there is a need, I think, for a mix of some experience \u2026 It\u2019s an investigative committee. I\u2019m an attorney. Gerry and I have done a ton of investigations together. I think that has value.\u201d"

      "Harvard released the reports on Tuesday while the university simultaneously\u00a0battles the Trump administration\u00a0over demands to limit campus activism \u2014 reforms the government says are necessary to root out campus antisemitism. The administration has frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding and Harvard\u00a0responded with a lawsuit\u00a0in a clash that is being watched closely across higher education.",
      "In a campus message, Harvard President Alan Garber said Harvard has made \u201cnecessary changes and essential progress\u201d over the last year but promised further action.",
      "\u201cWe will redouble our efforts to ensure that the University is a place where ideas are welcomed, entertained and contested in the spirit of seeking truth,\u201d Garber wrote.",
      "Garber convened two panels to study campus antisemitism and anti-Muslim bias last year, with an initial round of recommendations released last June. The final reports total more than 500 pages and include dozens of recommended changes.",
      "Harvard said it will begin implementing at least some of the recommendations, with potential updates to admissions, hiring and discipline systems.",
      "In a list of \u201cactions and commitments,\u201d Harvard said it will review admissions processes to make sure applicants are evaluated based on their ability to \u201cengage constructively with different perspectives, show empathy and participate in civil discourse.\u201d",
      "It pointed to a recently added application question asking students about a time they strongly disagreed with someone. The antisemitism task force called for that kind of questioning, saying Harvard should reject anyone with a history of bias and look unfavorably on \u201cexhibitions of hostility, derision or dismissiveness.\u201d",
      "Still, it appears to fall short of the Trump administration\u2019s demands around admissions, which called on Harvard to end all preferences \u201cbased on race, color, national origin, or proxies thereof\u201d and implement \u201cmerit-based\u201d policies by August. The Supreme Court has\u00a0rejected the use of race\u00a0in college admissions, but many colleges look at factors including students\u2019 family income and geography to bring a diverse class to campus.",
      "Responding to complaints that Harvard\u2019s instruction had become too politicized and anti-Israel, the university said it will work to hold professors to new standards of \u201cexcellence.\u201d Deans will make sure faculty promote intellectual openness and refrain from endorsing political positions \u201cthat may cause students to feel pressure to demonstrate allegiance,\u201d the university said.",
      "Courses and curriculum will also be reviewed to reflect those standards.",
      "Other changes include required antisemitism training for students and staff, along with expanded academic offerings on Hebrew, Judaic, Arab and Islamic studies. Harvard will put money toward a research project on antisemitism along with a historical overview on Muslims, Arabs and Palestinians at the university.",
      "In his message, Garber said Harvard will accelerate a campus-wide effort to promote viewpoint diversity, though he didn\u2019t elaborate. Viewpoint diversity is among the top concerns of the White House, which demanded that Harvard hire an external auditor to make sure the student body and every academic department represent diverse views.",
      "Harvard is the first university to openly defy the Trump administration as it uses\u00a0its hold on colleges\u2019 federal funding\u00a0to press its political agenda.",
      "The administration has argued that universities did not do enough to check antisemitism at campus protests last year. Garber has said Harvard will not bend to the demands, calling it a threat to academic freedom and the autonomy of all universities."

      "Brixie and House Democrats did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Republican official said the penalties, first reported by State Affairs, would remain in place for the foreseeable future.",
      "The bizarre incident happened on April 17, when state Rep. Matt Maddock arrived to go to work at the Capitol and parked his car across two spots, one of which was Brixie's, the official said.",
      "Video of the parking area that was later released by House Republicans showed Brixie wrapping the midsection of the car in plastic wrap.",
      "\u201cMy good colleague from the 51st district parked in two spots, including mine, to make sure no one hit his fancy car,\u201d Brixie told The Detroit News earlier this month. \u201cI Saran Wrapped it to give it an extra layer of protection.\"",
      "She then appeared to try to draw Maddock's attention to her work by making an announcement on the House floor a short time after the wrapping. \u201cI just came in from the parking ramp and there\u2019s a black BMW\" with a vanity license plate, Brixie said. \"Your hood is open, your lights are on and your engine is running. Thank you.\"",
      "Maddock responded on social media later that day, saying Brixie \"keeps trying to get my attention and I keep telling her I\u2019m married.\"",
      "The penalties mean that Brixie cannot deliver official addresses or remarks on the House floor for the time being, and has to park much farther away.",
      "Asked Tuesday if he and Brixie had exchanged apologies, Maddock said in an email, \"She hasn\u2019t apologized, but I wouldn\u2019t expect her to since Democrats get to crime and never say sorry.\"",
      "\"I can forgive her for pranking my car, but she should really be sorry for her awful votes that have been ruining Michigan,\" he added.",
      "Maddock's wife, whose car he said he had borrowed that day, also ripped Brixie on social media on the day of the wrapping and announcement on the floor.",

      "She announced in January that her cancer is in remission.",
      "\u201cIt is a relief to now be in remission and I remain focused on recovery. As anyone who has experienced a cancer diagnosis will know, it takes time to adjust to a new normal,\u201d she said in a statement shared on Instagram.",
      "Kate continued, \u201cMy heartfelt thanks goes to all those who have quietly walked alongside William and me as we have navigated everything. We couldn\u2019t have asked for more. The care and advice we have received throughout my time as a patient has been exceptional.\u201d"

    "summary": "Christie Brinkley sits down with TODAY.com to talk about her new memoir \"Uptown Girl\" and her 11-year marriage to music legend Billy Joel.",
    "story": [
      "Christie Brinkley, one of the most recognizable faces in modeling, offers a revealing glimpse into the challenges of being one of the world's original supermodels in her new memoir, \"Uptown Girl.\"",
      "Gracing the cover of more than 500 magazines and appearing in memorable movies like the 1983 hit film, \"National Lampoon\u2019s Vacation,\" Brinkley's career spans five decades, and she delves into much of it in her new book.",
      "\"I just want to tell some stories,\" Brinkley tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"I hope it'll be a nice diversion in a world that can use a good book every now and then, take you away on a little adventure.\"",
      "From being discovered at a payphone in Paris to being kicked out of Frank Sinatra's hotel room, \"Uptown Girl\" offers insight behind Brinkley's upbringing in Southern California and her ascent to the top of the modeling world. The book also explores her four marriages (and divorces), including 11 years she spent with Billy Joel.",
      "It's the music legend who penned \"Uptown Girl,\" the song that inspired the memoir's title, which has become Brinkley's enduring nickname \u2014 in spite of the fact that, according to the supermodel, it wasn't initially written for her.",
      "Brinkley writes in her memoir that it started out as a song for a \"mystery girl\" Joel had been having phone conversations with, but when his relationship with Brinkley began, he finished it in her honor. Their relationship was then immortalized in the hit song's iconic music video, in which Brinkley appears in.",
      "'Dancing in the kitchen' with Billy Joel",
      "In \"Uptown Girl,\" Brinkley, 71, opens up about her various heartbreaks, difficult early childhood with an abusive father and the helicopter accident that almost claimed her life in 1994. However, the model says that opening up about her marriage to Joel was the most difficult part of penning the memoir.",
      "\"The hardest thing to include was criticism of Billy, because I do care about my friendship with him,\" she says of the chapters that reveal Joel's heavy drinking and suggested affairs, which has been making headlines since her book came out.",
      "\"In the book, I feel like I balanced, very much, about how happy we were and how joy-filled our days were,\" she says of their marriage. \"It was literally dancing in the kitchen as we cooked, singing together, and making each other laugh. It was a beautiful, wonderful relationship.\"",
      "According to the memoir, that relationship became strained, in part, after Joel sued Frank Weber, his former manager, for having allegedly siphoned off his profits. It was a betrayal that Brinkley writes left Joel \"withdrawn and stressed\" as singer-songwriter felt immense pressure to recoup his financial loss.",
      "\"He was going through extraordinary circumstances in his life, things most people wouldn't ever have to deal with,\" she describes.",
      "Despite the vulnerable nature of the admissions, Brinkley says they were important to include in the memoir. \"I did have to go there because that was the reality.\"",
      "Brinkley tells TODAY.com that Joel had given his blessing to talk candidly about the ups and downs of their longtime relationship.",
      "\"He said, 'Just say what you need to say,'\" Brinkley recalls. \"And I think that's part of his healing, so I applaud him for all of that. It takes a lot of courage.\"",
      "The new memoir reveals some darker times in their relationship, including instances of Brinkley waking up in the middle of the night to discover Joel was missing, then him returning home in the wee hours of the morning after being out drinking all night.",
      "She also writes about the growing distance in their marriage that ultimately left her feeling \"lonely, despite the fact that he was right there.\" It was a loneliness so pervasive that Brinkley was thinking about Joel as she boarded a helicopter in Colorado, shortly after their separation in 1994, and wondered if the crooner would be worried about her embarking on a trip to go heli-skiing.",
      "\"For a moment I thought about my husband, Billy, whom I'd split with again, and hoping this trip to Telluride would wake him up to the reality that he might actually lose me,\" she writes.",
      "What she didn't know was that shortly after, the helicopter would crash into the San Juan mountains, leaving Brinkley and several companions temporarily stranded until they were rescued.",
      "Though Joel ultimately flew to her side and jetted her back to Long Island aboard a private plane, her dream of their reunion was dashed when she overheard him on the phone saying to an unknown caller, 'No, don't worry. I'm not going back to her. I just need to see her through this.'\"",
      "The revelation brought home the fact that their marriage was over. Two weeks later, they announced their divorce and as she penned in her memoir, \"the dream broke apart like debris.\"",
      "Despite their divorce, Brinkley tells TODAY.com that they still remain friends.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a very loyal guy. He\u2019s loyal to his friends, he\u2019s generous. He just had a lot of stresses on him at the point when we were together and it just kind of came crashing down on us.\u201d",
      "'I was raised to be grateful'",
      "Outside of her marriage, the helicopter crash changed her life in other ways.",
      "\"I went through a phase of post-traumatic stress disorder,\" she says of the accident that left her clinging to the side of a mountain amid a pile of helicopter wreckage.",
      "\"One of the hallmarks is bad decision-making. And I made quite a few, which I lay out in the book and that chapter was hard to write just because I didn't want to think about any of (the helicopter crash). I didn't want to go back to that place. At the time when it happened, I actually thought it was so awful, I wanted to purge it from my body and from my memory banks.\"",
      "While she's endured her fair share of trauma, Brinkley remains the eternal optimist, both in love and life.",
      "\"I was raised in a very positive household, so I was raised to be grateful and counting my blessings and to know the good things that I have, no matter what,\" she says.",
      "Among those blessings are Brinkley\u2019s three children: Alexa Ray Joel, 39, her daughter with Joel, as well as her son, Jack Brinkley-Cook, 29, and other daughter, Sailor Brinkley-Cook, 26, both of whom she shares with her ex-husband Peter Cook.",
      "While appearing on the April 28 episode of TODAY, Brinkley shared that out of her three children, her oldest daughter is the one who's read most of her memoir and that she loves it.",
      "\"She was kind of blown away by it,\" said Brinkley.",
      "As for the other two, the model joked that her younger children \"skimmed through\" it and said, \"We know her!\" but otherwise, \"I don't think they understand the reason to read it.\"",
      "'This is not a revenge novel'",
      "Though Brinkley has released two other books, including a 1983 fitness book and \"Timeless Beauty,\" a wellness guide published in 2015, \"Uptown Girl\" is her first memoir, and she wants readers to take something positive away from her experiences.",
      "\"I just really hope people understand that the book is much more than rehashing divorces,\" she explains, referring to her other marriages to Jean-Francois\u00a0Allaux, Richard Taubman and Cook, all of which ended in divorce.",
      "\"This is not a revenge novel. It's filled with joy and when there are bad moments, it's sort of how to keep going and not let them pull you down,\" she says. \"And how to stay positive and maybe learn something from it or let it propel you into someplace that you didn't dare go before.\""

      "\"My dad dreamed of having his horses in the Kentucky Derby for over 30 years,\" she wrote on Instagram on April 27. \"Here he is still making his dreams come true from his castle in the sky. Our horse Render Judgment made it yesterday just hours before the post position drawing.",

He could have had a PhD in horse pedigrees. What an incredible journey we\u2019ve been on to get here. Win or lose, he made it to the Derby and that for me is everything.

      "After delivering her remarks, she stepped to the side of the stage in front of the curtains. She writes that a man tapped her on the shoulder from behind the curtains. As he leaned in closer to her, Brinkley writes that he said, \"I need to tell you that that arrogant husband of yours has been having an affair with my teenage daughter, and he won\u2019t knock it off.\"",
      "Immediately, Brinkley explains that she could not move.",
      "\"I was so stunned that I froze,\" she wrote. \"Immediately, I glanced into the audience, scanning the front row for Peter, who was sitting there with Jack (their son), and as soon as I saw him, Peter\u2019s eyes were already trained on my face, as he began shaking his head 'no' and mouthing the word silently at the same time.

      "\"I knew from Peter\u2019s face that he was guilty, and in that moment, I thought I was going to pass out onstage, in front of hundreds of people,\" Brinkley writes. \"I also felt tears began to well in my eyes, and I bent down to pretend to retie the ribbons of my espadrilles around my ankles so I wouldn\u2019t faint or start sobbing onstage.\"",
      "Brinkley says that as soon as she was out of the kids earshot, she told Peter to \"pack a bag and leave\" before embarking on a journey to uncover more information about the situation from the man, who turned out to be a police officer.",
      "\"When your whole world falls apart and you realize in a heartbeat you\u2019ve suddenly become the clich\u00e9 middle-aged woman whose husband is having an affair with a much (much) younger woman, what do you do? You call your best friends,\" Brinkley writes.",
      "And that's what she did, ringing up her friends Jill and Mindy who helped her search their family computer where they found, she writes, \"a panoply of frightening email exchanges, incriminating photos and porn accounts.\"",

      "\"One thing I've learned in life is that you always have to be able to laugh, no matter how bad things become,\" Brinkley writes.",
      "For the next month, Brinkley worked on collecting evidence and working quietly on the what she explains became a \"very nasty (and very public) divorce.\" But to the world, she told everyone Cook was away on business and acted as if all was normal for her kids' sake and to helm public gossip.",
      "\"On the inside, I felt shattered, but on the outside, I still wore a pretty party dress and smiled so widely it hurt, greeting all our guests and telling everyone, including my kids, that Peter was still away on business,\" Brinkley recalls, noting it was the \"greatest acting job\" of her career yet.",
      "But when the news broke about Cook's affairs with multiple teenage girls, Brinkley writes that \"the paparazzi followed me around like a wagon train, and after a day or two, I realized I had become a prisoner in my own home yet again.\"",
      "What followed was a six-year long court battle between the two in which Brinkley publicly called Cook a narcissist, which she writes inspired others moms to leave their own narcissistic husbands.",
      "In 2012, Cook went on TODAY to defend himself after Brinkley spoke to the show earlier that same week about their marriage, noting that Cook had been trying to ruin her through \"character assassination\" and saying anytime she has joy or success, Cook tries to destroy it. He admitted he's a narcissist, saying it \"makes you focus attention on something\" which helped him be a better dad. He also claimed that Brinkley lied about \u201cvirtually everything\u201d she said on the show.",
      "\u201cThe entire content of her interview was a lie where she claims that I am harassing and bullying her on a daily basis,\u201d he said on TODAY in 2012, noting that they hadn't spoken in four years and claiming she was employing \"crocodile tears\" on the show when she broke down. \"So this perception that I am harassing and bullying her is, is nonsense.\u201d"

      "Instead, the new show is about empowering people to discover and embrace their unique style, even if their dream looks don\u2019t follow any conventional fashion guidelines.",
      "\u201cWe are no longer applying rules that come from our perspective,\u201d London tells TODAY.com. \u201cWe are asking our clients what their dream style is, why they haven\u2019t been able to achieve it and really help them along the way and guide them, rather than make it about geometry or looking thinner.\u201d",
      "A new premise...",
      "London says she and Kelly don\u2019t see themselves as style experts but as \u201cfairy godmothers,\u201d helping people express themselves through fashion.",
      "That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s anything wrong with some good old color, texture, pattern and shine \u2014 or that \u201cWhat Not to Wear\u201d standby, the pointy-toe shoe.",
      "It\u2019s just that now, London and Kelly are digging a little deeper.",
      "\u201cLike, pointy-toe shoes do make your legs look longer, but why do you want to wear a pointy-toe shoe? What\u2019s the style that you\u2019re going for? What do you want to communicate to other people?\u201d London says. \u201cSo we talk to them pretty significantly about what\u2019s holding them back psychologically.\u201d",
      "Eight clients from all walks of life nominated themselves for the show\u2019s first season, which premiered on Prime Video April 29, including a young mom hoping to reclaim her style identity, a grandmother and breast cancer survivor discovering her \"inner diva\u201d and a young transgender man exploring style identity.",
      "In each episode, the client puts together their own dream outfits from a curated closet, then road tests the looks at an event in the real world. All the while, Kelly and London are rooting them on without judgment.",
      "\u201cOur job was to make it as safe as possible, and we were there every step of the way,\u201d Kelly tells TODAY.com.",
      "After clients try out their initial fantasy looks, they have the opportunity to refine their style further and to brainstorm with Kelly and London what outfits might work for them in their daily lives.",

      "\u201cFor the first five years we worked together, I either adored her or despised her, and never anything in between,\u201d he wrote at the time.",

      "The same year, London blocked Kelly on Twitter, which Kelly said at the time felt like \u201cgetting a little slap in the face.\u201d",
      "But all that is clearly behind them now. The pair announced their reconciliation in 2023 and said they had worked through any sticking points in their relationship.",
      "\u201cSo I reached out to Stacy and I was like, \u2018Can we put this behind us? Let\u2019s talk it out.\u2019 And we had a really emotional conversation. It was during the pandemic, sort of as the pandemic was ending. And we just talked through it all,\u201d Kelly said during a joint visit to TODAY with London in September 2023.",

    "summary": "How accurate is the movie Conclave compared to the real election of the pope? Here's what to know",
    "story": [
      "Following Pope Francis' death on April 21, all eyes are on the College of Cardinals who are set to start a conclave soon to elect a new pope.",
      "The process has remained largely secretive over the eight centuries that conclaves have been used to elect new popes as cardinals sequester themselves during the voting process.",
      "The conclave following the death of Pope Francis will begin May 7, Vatican officials announced. In the meantime, people have turned to the 2024 Oscar-winning film \"Conclave\" to get an inside look at the process. In fact, \"Conclave\" viewing rose 283% in the week following Pope Francis' death, \"coming in at nearly 7 million minutes watched across streaming platforms,\" Carson Daly said on TODAY.",
      "But how accurate is \"Conclave\" to the actual papal conclave? Let's get into it.",
      "What parts of 'Conclave' were spot-on?",
      "While the process of selecting a new pope is extremely secretive, certain things are known, which the film shows.",
      "Much of the film unfolds in a re-creation of the Vatican's famous Sistine Chapel, where the conclave takes place in real life.",
      "The Sistine Chapel is sealed off until voting has closed \u201cso that total secrecy may be ensured with regard to everything said or done there in any way pertaining, directly or indirectly, to the election of the Supreme Pontiff,\u201d the\u00a0Apostolic Constitution states.",
      "The film accurately depicts the behind-the-scenes political conversations that occur between cardinals during a papal conclave, according to a Vatican expert.",
      "\u201cKeep in mind that cardinals are human beings. They\u2019re political animals as well. They will be meeting in various places,\u201d Philip Pullella, a Vatican expert and author, said in a segment that aired on TODAY April 21. \u201cYou know, Cardinal X will say to Cardinal Y, I\u2019ve been talking about this to Cardinal Z.\u201d",
      "Despite the drama and revelations, the voting in \"Conclave\" is fairly efficient. The cardinals take three days to elect a new pope in the film.",
      "Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI were both elected slightly faster \u2014 in two days. The longest conclave in the 20th century was in 1903, when the election of Pope Pius X took five days.",
      "The new pope accepts the position using Latin phrase laid out by the Apostolic Constitutions.",
      "Once a new pope has been selected, the dean of the College of Cardinals will ask the candidate-elect in Latin, \"Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff?\"",
      "The candidate-elect needs to respond with \"Accepto,\" which is Latin for \"I accept.\"",
      "\"Conclave\" displays this exact conversation.",
      "What parts of 'Conclave' were semi-accurate?",
      "Other scenes in \"Conclave\" are partially correct.",
      "After the late pope dies, the cardinals gather around his body. Cardinal Tremblay (John Lithgow) removes his ring. Then Tremblay immediately breaks it, delivering the line, \u201cThe throne of the Holy See is vacant.\u201d",
      "As \"Conclave\" shows, the pope's signet ring, called Ring of the Fisherman, is destroyed after his death to signify the papal vacancy and to ensure that no forgeries can be made in the pope's name as the ring serves as a seal for letters, too.",
      "Traditionally the ring is removed from the pope's body, then it is held by the camerlengo (a Vatican official) until it is ceremoniously destroyed, according to the Vatican News.",
      "So, while the film got across the point that the ring needs to be removed and destroyed, it modified the process, depicting a private, quick ceremony.",
      "In the movie, cardinals burn their votes and send a signal to the outside world through the Sistine Chapel chimney. Black smoke signifies no choice has been made. White smoke signifies a new pope has been chosen.",
      "The colors are right but the number of burning sessions is not. In the film, the ballots are burned after each vote, whereas during a real conclave the ballots are burned after each voting session.",
      "According to the Vatican News, there are two voting sessions per day, and each session has two ballots.",
      "What parts of 'Conclave' were inaccurate?",
      "Here's what an expert said was the \"biggest mistake\" in the movie.",
      "Perhaps the biggest plot hole in the film was the movie's addition of Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz), the archbishop of Kabul.",
      "As the papal conclave is preparing to sequester themselves, Cardinal Benitez arrives with paperwork explaining that the previous pope had appointed him a cardinal \"in pectore,\" which means in secret.",
      "Cardinal Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes) tells Cardinal Bellini (Stanley Tucci), \"I don't think we have any choice but to admit him,\" allowing him into the conclave.",
      "\"The biggest mistake in the movie was the admission of a cardinal in pectore into the conclave,\u201d Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior analyst with the Religion News Service and a Vatican expert told the AP. \u201cIf the name is not announced publicly by the pope in the presence of the College of Cardinals, he has no right to attend a conclave.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Benitez's age would probably prevent some from voting for him. While his age is not specified in the film, Diehz is 54 years old.",
      "\u201cThe Vatican is a very strange place because someone who is 65 or 70 is considered too young,\u201d Pullella said on TODAY. \u201cVery few cardinals want another papacy to last another 30 years.\u201d",
      "Cardinal Lawrence also breaks multiple rules himself, including busting into the sealed off quarters of the deceased pope to investigate other cardinals and telling another cardinal something that was told to him in confessional.",
      "According to the Code of Canon Law, the penalty for breaking the seal of confession is ex-communication.",
      "And while there's no specific punishment stated for breaking into the deceased pope's personal chambers, it is also unlikely that Cardinal Lawrence would be able to get away with that and even still be a favorable contender for the papacy himself."

      "\u201cThey always start out being about the bride, and then there\u2019s alcohol involved,\" he said during a retrospective of his career at SXSW in Austin, Texas. \"And by about 10:30, the song comes on, and suddenly the wedding becomes about me getting out and dancing.

      "Surprisingly, he said he's only seen the movie \u201cthree or four times,\u201d while his\u00a0two adult kids with wife Kyra Sedgwick\u00a0have never seen it.",
      "However, he still maintains a connection to the film.",

      "\u201cI think that it was a great gift to be part of that movie,\u201d he continued. \u201cI certainly took it very seriously when I was doing it, and I love that people will still come up and say that they just showed it to their kids.\u201d",
      "Bacon even made a trip in 2024 to the Utah high school\u00a0where the movie was shot. His visit came 40 years after \"Footloose\" was released in theaters.",

He said that as a young man, he was fiercely opposed to theft, but had turned to a life of crime due to the bad influence of friends and money difficulties, in the hope it would prove an easier path.",
      "Abbas said his family had suffered because of his crimes, adding that he had \u201cnever had a role model\u201d himself and he had done what he thought was needed to try to provide for his children.",
      "The accused spoke rapidly during his testimony, his arm shaking throughout, possibly due to the fact he is now suffering from Parkinson's disease. At one point, the shaking was violent enough for him to hold one hand in the other.",
      "In the years since the 2016 robbery targeting Kardashian, Abbas said he now felt \u201cvery uneasy\u201d with what happened that day. But, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t do anything besides apologize.\u201dKardashian had been staying at a private apartment complex in the French capital when five of the accused are alleged to have gained entry into the building and robbed her at gunpoint, taking items including her engagement ring from her then-husband Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. The five other defendants are accused of related offenses, including planning and giving tipoffs on Kardashian's whereabouts.",
      "In the years since, one defendant has died, while the case of another, age 80, has been separated from that of the other defendants due to medical issues.",
      "In addition to Abbas, those standing trial will include Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as \u201cOld Omar,\u201d who is alleged to have masterminded the robbery; his son, Harminy, 37, accused of being the getaway driver; Didier \u201cBlue Eyes\u201d Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian\u2019s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35,\u00a0who is accused of tipping the others off on Kardashian's whereabouts. Christiane Glotin, 78, is also among the accused, with authorities alleging she was an accomplice in the heist.",
      "At least four defendants were expected to be questioned in court Tuesday.",
      "Kardashian herself is expected to appear in court May 13. The reality star and businesswoman has previously detailed her experience during the robbery, at one point tearing up in an interview with David Letterman as she described how she feared she would be sexually assaulted and\u00a0possibly killed during the attack.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, this is the time I\u2019m going to get raped ... just prepare yourself,\u201d she said in the interview, wiping away tears, later describing how she feared her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, would find her dead.",
      "\u201cI just kept on thinking about Kourtney,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be traumatized for the rest of her life if she sees me.\u201d",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump injected himself into the race with his tariffs on Canadian imports and repeatedly saying Canada should become the 51st U.S. state.",
    "story": [
      "Canadian voters backed Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s Liberal Party on Monday, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. projects, in a national election strongly influenced by President Donald Trump.",
      "The CBC said it was too early to know whether the Liberals would win enough seats to form a majority government, but it projected another term for the party, which has governed Canada for almost a decade.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s ready to stand up for Canada with me?\u201d Carney told cheering supporters early Tuesday. He said that Trump\u2019s repeated comments about making Canada the 51st U.S. state were \u201cnot idle threats.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is trying to break us, so that America can own us. That will never, that will never, ever happen,\u201d he said.",
      "Carney said it was important to recognize that \u201cour world has fundamentally changed,\u201d and that Canada\u2019s old relationship with the United States, its longtime ally and trading partner, is \u201cover.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to look out for ourselves.\u201d",
      "Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the opposition Conservatives, conceded defeat earlier Tuesday and congratulated Carney, describing the Liberals\u2019 projected victory as a \u201crazor-thin minority government\u201d and saying his party would hold them accountable.",
      "Only a few months ago, Poilievre \u2014 who is in danger of losing his seat in Parliament as votes continue to be counted \u2014 seemed poised to be the next leader of Canada amid public frustration with soaring inflation, rising immigration and what was criticized as then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s overly conciliatory approach to Trump, then the president-elect.",
      "Trudeau announced his resignation Jan. 6, two weeks before Trump was inaugurated, after polls showed him struggling with voters.",
      "Since he returned to office, however, Trump has enraged Canadians with his behavior toward one of his country\u2019s closest allies. His policies and rhetoric \u2014 including imposing steep tariffs on Canadian imports and the \u201c51st state\u201d comments \u2014 became the central issue in the Canadian election and helped the Liberals make a remarkable turnaround, closing an almost 20-point gap with the Conservatives in a matter of weeks. The Liberals were also boosted by a candidate, Carney, who may be uniquely positioned to respond to Trump and the global economic uncertainty his tariffs have created.",
      "Like Trump, Carney had never held elected office before becoming his country\u2019s leader and spent much of his life in the private sector. He became prime minister last month after he was elected leader of the Liberal Party, then quickly called a snap election in the hope of securing a full term.",
      "Carney, 60, is also a former central banker used to dealing with economic crises, having run the Bank of Canada after the 2008 global financial crisis and the Bank of England during the Brexit process.",
      "He touted that experience during the campaign, which lasted 37 days.",
      "\u201cMark offers the proven leadership and real plan we need to deliver change for our party and our country, and to build the strongest economy in the G7,\u201d his campaign said, referring to the Group of Seven industrialized nations.",
      "Poilievre had been on a rising trajectory until earlier this year, with his \u201cTrump light\u201d style embraced by the populist wing of his party. As anger in Canada grew, however, his similarities with Trump began to work against him.",
      "Poilievre ran on job opportunities and on promises that Gen Z voters would be able to afford housing, leveraging public fatigue with the Liberal government. At a rally Sunday, the CBC quoted him as calling the Trudeau government \u201cthe lost Liberal decade of rising crime, chaos, drugs and disorder.\u201d",
      "Trump continued goading Canada on Monday as voters went to the polls, saying again that it should become the \u201ccherished\u201d 51st U.S. state.",
      "\u201cALL POSITIVES WITH NO NEGATIVES. IT WAS MEANT TO BE!\u201d he said on his Truth Social platform.\u00a0Both Carney and Poilievre rebuked Trump over such comments and others he has made about the Canadian election.",
      "\u201cThey can become divided and weak,\u201d Carney said in a video on social media Monday, speaking of the U.S. \u201cBut this is Canada. And we decide what happens here.\u201d",
      "Poilievre wrote Monday on X: \u201cPresident Trump, stay out of our election.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCanada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state.\u201d",
      "One voter said he voted Liberal because Poilievre \u201csounds like mini-Trump to me.\u201d Reid Warren, of Toronto, told The Associated Press that tariffs were also a concern.",
      "\u201cCanadians coming together from, you know, all the shade being thrown from the States is great, but it\u2019s definitely created some turmoil, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Warren said.",
      "Trump did not appear to have publicly commented on the election result as of late Monday, but his predecessor congratulated Carney and the Liberals.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m confident Mark will be a strong leader for the fundamental values and interests Canadians and Americans share,\u201d former President Joe Biden said in a post on X."

      "\u201cIn the specific context of the current situation in the occupied Palestinian Territories, these obligations entail allowing all relevant U.N. entities to carry out activities for the benefit of the local population,\u201d Elinor Hammarskjold said.",
      "Palestinian representative Ammar Hijazi said Israel was using humanitarian aid as \u201ca weapon of war\u201d, while people in Gaza were facing starvation.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel had submitted its position in writing to the hearings, which he described as a \u201ccircus\u201d.",
      "Speaking in Jerusalem on Monday, Saar said the court was being politicized, while the U.N. was failing to root out employees of its Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA who are members of Gaza militant groups.",
      "\u201cThey are abusing the court once again to try and force Israel to cooperate with an organization that is infested with Hamas terrorists,\u201d Saar said. \u201cThe goal is to deprive Israel of its most basic right to defend itself.\u201d",
      "The U.N. said in August that nine UNRWA staff may have been involved in Hamas\u2019 October 7, 2023 assault and had been fired. Another Hamas commander, confirmed by UNRWA as one of its employees, was killed in Gaza in October, according to Israel.",
      "The\u00a0ICJ, also known as the World Court, was tasked in December to form an\u00a0advisory opinion\u00a0on Israel\u2019s obligations to facilitate aid to Palestinians that is delivered by states and international groups, including the United Nations.",
      "Israel has repeatedly said it would not allow the entry of goods and supplies into Gaza until Hamas releases all remaining hostages. It has accused Hamas of hijacking humanitarian aid, which the militant group denies.",
      "\u201cThis case is about Israel destroying the fundamentals of life in Palestine, while it blocks the U.N. and other providers of humanitarian aid from providing life-saving aid to the population,\u201d Hijazi, the head of the Palestinian mission to the Netherlands, told the hearing.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he had\u00a0pushed\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allow food and medicine into Gaza. Germany, France and Britain last week\u00a0called\u00a0to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian territory.",
      "Advisory opinions of the\u00a0ICJ\u00a0carry legal and political weight, although they are not binding and the court has no enforcement powers.",

      "The U.S. military\u2019s Central Command, in a statement early Monday before news of the alleged strike broke, sought to defend its policy of offering no specific details of its extensive airstrike campaign.

      "\u201cToday, God sends us cans, so we\u2019re cooking them for the children,\u201d Suad Al-Zurai, 57, said of the canned beans that she stirs in a simmering pot. It's the 558th day of the war, and the children, along with the adults, are hungry, covered in dust, haunted by death and facing another day of scraping together a life from the ruins of the Gaza Strip.",
      "NBC News' crew on the ground spent a day with the Al-Zurai family, from early morning to sunset, to see how they, and thousands of families across the enclave, are living after the ceasefire broke, and Israel began a blockade in early March, barring the entry of food, water, medicine and other supplies into the enclave.",
      "There are 16 members of the Al-Zurai family to share the single pot of beans, eight of them children. At least five more should be there with them, Suad says. One of her sons was killed along with two of her grandchildren, while another, Khaled Al-Zurai,\u00a0has been missing for days after an explosion that killed one of his sons. Suad is now taking care of his wife, who has cancer, and their four surviving children. Her third son, Hamed Al-Zurai, and his four children also live with her. Other relatives are displaced to other parts of Gaza.",

      "Her slain loved ones are among more than 51,000 people who have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local health ministry, since Israel launched its offensive in the enclave following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks. Some 1,200 people were killed during the attacks in southern Israel and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Throughout the course of the day, worries over food, water and other necessities dominate the family's discussions, and finding those supplies takes up much of the rest of their time as humanitarian groups warn that aid is running out.",
      "At one point, Hamed Al-Zurai's 3-year-old daughter, Anwar, throws herself to the floor, crying out for rice, but there isn\u2019t any more to give her.",
      "\u201cMy children are constantly crying,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to eat. And I answer them, \u2018How? There are no open crossings, so how can I get you food, my love?\u2019\u201d",
      "Before the war, most of the children spent their mornings at school. Now, they dedicate hours each day to trying to find food and water.",

At the soup kitchen, there's already a crowd of other children, along with some women and men, waiting for food under the hot sun. The younger Suad stands with her empty pot in her hands, gazing into the distance, bored and exhausted, as she waits, later joining her brother and sister and sitting in a ditch in the shade before they try again.",
      "On offer is rice \u2014 and after waiting for an hour, they fill their pots, carrying it back to their tent.",
      "While they're getting food, Hamed and young Anwar are out to get water for the family. Anwar walks swiftly as she carries two water jugs, each nearly half the size of her small body.",
      "Before the war, Hamed Al-Zurai had a cart and a donkey that he would use to rent out transportation services, but after the donkey died in the war and he lost his cart, he no longer has a way to make money. Unable to buy food or water, the family is left dependent on swiftly dwindling aid.\u201cThe situation is dire,\u201d he said.",
      "But even at a time of incredible darkness, there are moments of light for the Al-Zurais: smiles as they gather together in their tent, finally sharing their hard-won lunch.",
      "After eating, Mohammed gives his younger siblings and cousins old rubber tires to play with. Anwar grins as she wheels one across the sandy ground.",
      "As the sun goes down, the children huddle in a circle outside, laughing as they play hand-clapping games. And for a moment, they look just like any other children anywhere else in the world.Then, they return to their makeshift tent to eat a meager dinner of more rice and beans, before eventually settling down for bed, huddling together on the ground, wrapped in blankets.",

      "It was the deadliest attack on Indian civilians in almost two decades, and took place while Vice President JD Vance and his family were visiting another part of India. All but one of those killed were Indian nationals; the other was from Nepal.",
      "The attack near the town of Pahalgam in Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region that is the only Muslim-majority part of India, has devastated the local tourism industry on which many rely for their livelihood. It also undermined Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s insistence that the security situation had stabilized after a decadeslong separatist insurgency.",

On Saturday, Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged gunfire for the second day in a row along the Line of Control that divides the two parts of Kashmir.",
      "Modi, a Hindu nationalist who has overseen a crackdown on dissent in Kashmir, vowed retribution for the attack. The family homes of several suspects have been demolished.",
      "\u201cI say to the whole world, India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers,\u201d he said Thursday.",
      "President Donald Trump, who is close with Modi, said the Indian leader has his \u201cfull support.\u201d",
      "For Indians watching Modi\u2019s speech, it was an echo of 2019 when a convoy of Indian security forces was blown up in Kashmir and he responded by launching aerial strikes on Pakistan.",
      "Six years later, Indian nationalism is higher than ever, the Pakistan military\u2019s grip on power has weakened, and the U.S. is no longer in Afghanistan, which analysts say historically deterred violence between India and Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThat perhaps gives India a bit of a blank check to do whatever it pleases,\u201d said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "A region simmering with rage",
      "Resentment between India and Pakistan dates to 1947, when Hindu-majority India gained independence from British colonial rule and Muslim-majority Pakistan was established as a separate state in a deadly partition in which at least an estimated million people were killed while migrating across the newly formed border.",
      "The border lines were clearly defined and accepted except for the mountainous state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is among the most militarized places in the world. Both Pakistan and India lay full claim to it, but most of it is Indian-administered, while Pakistan controls a small chunk to the west.",
      "Tensions have escalated since Modi revoked Kashmir\u2019s semiautonomous status in 2019, effectively putting the region under direct control of the federal government in a move that was criticized by rights groups and raised fears that Kashmir\u2019s ethnic and religious identity would be diluted by Hindu settlers.",
      "Modi\u2019s government said the move ended decades of armed rebellion in the region. Elections were held last year and hailed as a sign of normalcy.",
      "\u201cOne indicator of normalcy that the government was always giving out was, look, there are so many tourists visiting,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Deependra Singh Hooda, former head of the Indian Army\u2019s Northern Command, who was stationed in Jammu and Kashmir from 2012 to 2016.",
      "Praveen Donthi, a New Delhi-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the attack was a \u201ccolossal intelligence failure.\u201d",

      "'Bodies lying on the ground'",
      "Pallavi Rao and her husband, Manjunath, had taken their son to Kashmir to celebrate his near-perfect score on his high school diploma exams. They had enjoyed a boat ride on the popular Dal lake in Kashmir\u2019s main city of Srinagar before heading to Pahalgam about 30 miles away.",
      "The militants found them in the meadow.",
      "After her husband was shot in the head, Rao told reporters, she and her son asked the militants to kill them too. They refused, saying, \u201cWe won\u2019t kill you. Go tell Prime Minister Modi.\u201d",
      "A local pony handler, Syed Adil Hussain Shah, was also killed while trying to save the tourists.",
      "\u201cHe used to earn 300 rupees [$3.50] in a day, our only source of income in the family,\u201d Ravisa Hussain Shah, his younger sister, told NBC News in an interview at their home in the village of Hapatnur.",
      "Among the first to reach the scene was Sajad Ahmad Bhat, 31, a shawl seller and tour guide.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who the boy was. But he was crying and seeking help. His hands and sweater were soaked in blood,\u201d he said.",
      "Since the attack, India has suspended a 1960 water treaty with Pakistan and closed the only functional land border crossing. Pakistan, which said any disruption to its water supply would be considered an \u201cact of war,\u201d has closed its airspace to Indian airlines and halted all trade with its neighbor.",

      "\u201cAnything less than the airstrikes in 2019 will not do. The public is seeking something much bigger,\u201d Donthi said. \u201cAfter riding the tiger of hypernationalism, the government has backed itself into a corner. This is their litmus test and they have to come out with flying colors.\u201d",

      "Even in death, Pope Francis\u2019 moral voice rang out across the world.",
      "With 40,000 packed into Vatican City\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square, another 250,000 in the surrounding streets and millions more watching on TV and online, world leaders, including President Donald Trump, were reminded of Francis\u2019 central messages during his funeral Saturday.",
      "\u201c\u2018Build bridges, not walls\u2019 was an exhortation he repeated many times,\u201d Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re said during the homily for the late pope. \u201cHis gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.\u201d",
      "And war \u201calways leaves the world worse than it was before: It is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone,\u201d Re said.",
      "Francis often railed against the geopolitical tides. He urged more compassion for immigrants and refugees at a time when the White House and other governments are cracking down. He called for an end to the war in Gaza and denounced climate change and exploitative capitalism \u2014 when those crises have only intensified.",
      "Under warm, blue skies with the world watching, the homily was a reminder of Francis\u2019 often lonely voice in a world characterized by economic and military hard power. It also brought to mind the unspoken questions, on this day at least, about whether the late pontiff\u2019s replacement will continue these progressive notes or revert to a more conservative bent.",
      "The relatively simple funeral for Francis, who died at age 88 on Monday, was attended by some 170 heads of state and other dignitaries. Trump sat among Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Britain\u2019s Prince William.",
      "Francis\u2019 casket was taken on a final journey in the so-called popemobile through the streets of Rome, past landmarks such as the Colosseum, to St. Mary Major Basilica, where he had chosen to be buried.",
      "The people lining the streets had come from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI could not have been anywhere else today. For me, Pope Francis was a wonderful pope, a gift that the lord gave us,\u201d said Katherine Gilligan, 59, who was visiting Rome last week from Jacksonville, Florida, and decided to postpone her return journey when Francis died. \u201cHe has loved us and taught us piety. It will be difficult for there to be another pope like him.\u201d",
      "At St. Mary Major Basilica, his casket was met, according to his wishes, by dozens of Rome\u2019s impoverished and needy, including prisoners, migrants, homeless and transgender people.",
      "It was just one reflection of a pope who did things a bit differently. He had even adjusted his own funeral plans: Whereas previous popes have been entombed in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead and oak, Francis requested he be buried in a single, simple wooden casket lined with zinc.",
      "Even so, this was an event of epic majesty. From the arcing dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, one of the largest churches in the world, to the striking image of a square divided between a mass of red on one side \u2014 the cardinals and bishops \u2014 and black on the other \u2014 attending dignitaries.",
      "In life, Francis had declined to live in the Vatican\u2019s gilded Apostolic Palace, choosing instead its far more plebeian guesthouse, Casa Santa Marta, where he died after a period of well-publicized illness.",
      "Francis had plenty of critics, both conservatives who believed he focused too much on progressive causes, and more liberal audiences who felt he did not go far enough with his reforms.",
      "Either way, the absence of his frequent and outspoken interjections on world affairs will leave a void to be filled. And though he spoke with a freedom unafforded to more prominent global figures, his funeral was still a deeply political event.",
      "Re\u2019s reminder that Francis preferred bridges over walls conjured the late pope\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s first-term promise to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "One day before his death, Francis met with Vice President JD Vance after sharply rebuking the Trump administration for cracking down on immigration and slashing international aid. In February, he said a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d was taking place in the United States, referring to \u201ca program of mass deportations.\u201d",
      "Perhaps inevitably with so many powerful figures in attendance, the funeral served as a forum for real-world geopolitics. Trump was seen locked in a sit-down discussion with Zelenskyy, two of the parties who say they are trying to negotiate a peace deal alongside Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said on X afterward that it was a \u201cgood meeting.\u201d But there was little immediate sign that Francis\u2019 death would solve a crisis he was unable to affect in life.",
      "Nevertheless, despite scandal within the church and uncertainty without, there was plenty of Francis\u2019 platform that few would disagree with.",
      "Re reflected this while closing the homily: \u201cEmbrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.\u201d"

      "Still, he won a seat in the German parliament earlier this year as part of the party\u2019s historic gains in the Bundestag during the national election.",
      "AfD\u2019s second-place finish cemented the party\u2019s status as a factor that other politicians can\u2019t ignore, but mainstream German parties have upheld the so-called \u201cfirewall\u201d by refusing to work with it."

      "SANTA ANA, El Salvador \u2014 The sprawling penitentiary where Kilmar Abrego Garcia was last known to be held offers a sharp contrast to the supermax mega-prison to which he was first deported.",
      "As opposed to tattooed gang members in brightly lit, crowded cells, the inmates at the Centro Industrial prison in Santa Ana wear yellow T-shirts and move more or less freely. Some spend much of their time outdoors raising dairy cows and growing vegetables. Others work in factories making uniforms for the armed forces or desks for public schools.",
      "The government calls them \u201ctrusted inmates\u201d: They have exhibited good behavior and are in the final years of their sentences. And the prison categorically excludes anyone accused of belonging to a gang.",
      "\u201cWe only house the common population,\u201d said Samuel Diaz, the prison\u2019s director and warden. \u201cNo gang members work here.\u201d",
      "NBC News obtained access Monday to the Centro Industrial in Santa Ana in a carefully choreographed tour. Officials did not provide access to Abrego Garcia, and they would not answer questions about his location, the conditions of his detention or any other aspects of his case. But they facilitated interviews with other inmates, who described the conditions in the prison as \u201cexcellent.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who the Justice Department has acknowledged should not have been sent to a prison in his native El Salvador because of an immigration judge\u2019s 2019 order barring such action.",
      "For human rights advocates in El Salvador and the United States, the details of Abrego Garcia\u2019s transfer \u2014 from the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a supermax prison specifically designed for gang members, to a low-security prison from which gang members are excluded \u2014 contradicts a central claim made by both governments: that Abrego Garcia is a dangerous member of MS-13 and a terrorist. (His wife and his attorney deny those allegations.)",
      "Abrego Garcia\u2019s precise whereabouts and condition remain unknown. Since he was deported, Abrego Garcia has been allowed no contact with his family or his lawyers. In a meeting with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., on April 17 (the only time he has been seen since he was deported), Abrego Garcia said he had been transferred out of CECOT to a different facility. Documents the Justice Department filed in federal court on April 20 subsequently confirmed that facility to be the Centro Industrial in Santa Ana. There have been no updates since then.",
      "From that perspective, Abrego Garcia\u2019s transfer out of CECOT is worrisome, said Gabriela Santos, director of the Human Rights Institute at the Central American University in San Salvador.",
      "\u201cWhy was he moved?\u201d Santos said. \u201cAnd where are all the other migrants that were brought here \u2014 are they in CECOT, or are they being put in different prisons in El Salvador?\u201d",
      "Santos said there is no evident legal basis for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele\u2019s agreement with Trump to receive and imprison deportees from the United States.",
      "\u201cFrom a legal point of view, there is no reason for [Abrego Garcia] to be here,\u201d Santos said. And because Bukele has consolidated power over all branches of government, she said, there is no viable avenue to challenge the policy.",
      "\u201cThere is no rule of law here in El Salvador. There is no respect for the principle of legality,\u201d she said.",
      "Like Abrego Garcia and others the Trump administration deported directly to CECOT, all inmates in the Salvadoran prison system are cut off from contact with lawyers, loved ones and\u00a0others on the outside. The policy is the result of a \u201cstate of exception\u201d that Bukele declared in 2022 after a particularly brutal wave of gang violence, in which he suspended many constitutional protections to quickly imprison tens of thousands without due process.",
      "About 85,000 people were imprisoned under the state of exception, according to Salvadoran human rights groups. Many were subjected to mass trials of a hundred or more defendants with no access to counsel. Advocates have documented numerous stories of people with no proven affiliation with gangs who were incarcerated indefinitely with virtually no recourse to appeal.",
      "Moreover, rights groups in El Salvador and abroad have harshly criticized prison conditions in the country, alleging systematic torture, malnutrition and other abuses. The nongovernmental legal organization Socorro Jur\u00eddico Humanitario has documented 370 deaths in Salvadoran prisons since the state of exception was declared, a number the group says is most a likely undercount.",
      "\u201cFor three years, we have lost all human rights and constitutional guarantees in El Salvador,\u201d said Ingrid Escobar, a lawyer for the organization.",
      "Bukele has acknowledged that some innocent people have been arrested under the state of exception.",
      "\u201cObviously, our operations are not perfect, and without the intention of hurting anyone innocent, some innocents have been arrested, in the same way they have been in France, Germany, Japan and every country in the world,\u201d Bukele said in November. \u201cAnd we are freeing them \u2014 we have freed 8,000 people, and we will free 100% of innocents.\u201d",
      "The Bukele administration says holding prisoners incommunicado was a necessary measure to break the control that gangs had over El Salvador\u2019s prisons, which involved regularly organizing murders, extortion and other criminal activity from inside penitentiaries.",
      "Since the state of exception was declared, public safety has improved dramatically in El Salvador. Numerous people interviewed on the streets of San Salvador said they feel free to move around the city and go about their business without fear of harassment, extortion or violence from gangs. Those improvements have made Bukele one of the most popular heads of state in the world.",
      "But human rights advocates say that the improvements have come at a heavy cost to Salvadoran democracy \u2014 and that Bukele\u2019s popularity is no justification for authoritarianism.",
      "\u201cPopularity cannot be a blank check for him to do anything he wants,\u201d Santos said. \u201cHistory has taught us that just because someone is popular, that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d"

      "The man, who has not been publicly identified, is a 27-year-old university student and Chinese national who lives in Tokyo, police said.",
      "Police in Japan\u2019s Shizuoka prefecture were alerted that he had returned Saturday when another climber reported spotting the student on the trail, \u201clying on the ground and shaking with abrasions.\u201d The next day, rescuers carried the injured man down about 2,600 feet on a stretcher before handing him to an emergency team.",
      "It was not clear whether he had successfully retrieved the phone.",
      "The rescued student was scaling Mount Fuji outside of its official climbing season, which is scheduled to\u00a0start in early July and end in early September. There is no penalty for off-season hiking or the need for rescue.",
      "Police in Shizuoka and Yamanashi, the two prefectures that the mountain straddles, were unable to provide additional details when reached for comment Tuesday, which was a national holiday in Japan.",
      "Mount Fuji, a national symbol of Japan, is 12,300 feet above sea level. It is a pilgrimage destination and UNESCO World Heritage site that attracts hikers from all over the world.",
      "Hikers are required to make prior reservations\u00a0and pay a mandatory fee of 4,000 yen ($36) to climb Mount Fuji, according to its official website. The charge was introduced in July 2024 to limit tourist numbers to 4,000 a day after growing complaints of litter, pollution and dangerously crowded trails.",
      "Climbers are advised to train in advance before going up Mount Fuji, whose shortest trail takes five hours to ascend and three hours to descend.",
      "Local police said last year that six climbers had died on Mount Fuji in July 2024 alone, exceeding the total number of fatalities in 2023, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo and Peter Guo reported from Hong Kong."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Four former Hong Kong lawmakers were freed from prison Tuesday after serving more than four years for their convictions under a Beijing-imposed security law that crushed a once-thriving pro-democracy movement.",
      "Claudia Mo, Jeremy Tam, Kwok Ka-ki and Gary Fan were among 47 activists arrested in 2021 for their roles in an unofficial primary election. They were the first of the convicted activists to reunite with their families and friends following years of separation.",
      "Only vehicles involved in the release were seen leaving the three prisons in remote areas of Hong Kong. Security was tight and curtains on the vehicles were closed.",
      "Mo\u2019s husband, Philip Bowring, told reporters he was pleased Mo had returned home, saying she was \u201cwell and in good spirits.\u201d But he said she would not give interviews for the time being. \u201cShe has to get used to life again in the outside world,\u201d he said at their door, adding that they probably would go to England to see their grandchildren later.",
      "In a video posted by local online media HK01, Fan thanked Hong Kongers and the media for their concern. He added he was going to reunite with his family.",
      "The 2020 unofficial primary drew 610,000 voters, and its winners had been expected to advance to the official legislative election. Authorities postponed that, however, citing public health risks during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "During the trial, prosecutors said the activists aimed to paralyze Hong Kong\u2019s government and force the city\u2019s leader to resign by aiming to win a legislative majority and using it to block government budgets indiscriminately. The judges said in their verdict last year that the activists\u2019 plans to effect change through the unofficial primary would have undermined the government\u2019s authority and created a constitutional crisis.",
      "Only two of the 47 original defendants were acquitted. The remaining activists received prison terms ranging from four years and two months to 10 years on a charge of conspiracy to commit subversion. Mo, Tam, Kwok and Fan pleaded guilty and received reduced sentences.",
      "Their years of separation have pained the activists and their families. The case involved democracy advocates across the spectrum. They include legal scholar Benny Tai, who got a 10-year prison term, and former student leader Joshua Wong, who has to serve four years and eight months.",
      "Fourteen of the convicted activists have appealed, and prosecutors appealed the acquittal of one activist. All of the appeals are pending.",
      "Critics of the court actions brought against the activists said their convictions illustrated how authorities crushed dissent following the massive anti-government protests in 2019, while also cracking down on media freedoms and reducing public choice in elections. They said the drastic political changes reflect the shrinking of the Western-style civil liberties in Hong Kong that Beijing promised to retain in the former British colony for 50 years after the 1997 handover to China.",
      "The Beijing and Hong Kong governments insisted the national security law was necessary for the city\u2019s stability. China defended the judicial decisions, despite criticism from foreign governments."

      "U.S. Temu shoppers, meanwhile, have voiced frustration on social media. One X user shared a photo of an online Temu shopping cart where they were charged just under $90 in import fees on an order\u00a0of $64 worth of merchandise. Another\u00a0shared a photo of their cart where Temu charged $135 in import fees\u00a0on $86 worth of merchandise.",
