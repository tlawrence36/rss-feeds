      "LOS ANGELES -- A woman charged with selling Matthew Perry the dose of ketamine that killed him is headed for a September trial.",
      "Jasveen Sangha's trial \u2014 the only one forthcoming in the death of the \u201cFriends\u201d star after four other defendants reached plea agreements with prosecutors \u2014 is now set to begin Sept. 23 after an order Tuesday from a federal judge in Los Angeles.",
      "The 42-year-old Sangha, who prosecutors say was known to her customers as \u201cThe Ketamine Queen,\u201d is charged with five counts of ketamine distribution, including one count of distribution resulting in death. She has pleaded not guilty and has been held in federal custody since her arrest last year.",
      "Her trial had been scheduled to start Aug. 19, but the judge postponed it for the fourth time since her April 2024 indictment after both sides agreed it should be moved.",
      "Sangha's lawyers said they needed the time to go through the huge amount of evidence they have received from the prosecution and to finish their own investigation.",

Perry's personal assistant, his friend and another doctor also entered guilty pleas and are cooperating with prosecutors. All are awaiting sentencing.",
      "Perry, who was found dead at age 54 at his home on Oct. 23, 2023, had been getting ketamine from his regular doctor for treatment of depression, an increasingly common off-label use for the surgical anesthetic.",
      "But prosecutors say when the doctor wouldn't give Perry as much as he wanted, he illegally sought more from Plasencia, then still more from Sangha, who they say presented herself as \"a celebrity drug dealer with high quality goods.\u201d",
      "Perry's assistant and friend said in their plea agreements that they acted as middlemen to buy large amounts of ketamine for Perry from Sangha, including 25 vials for $6,000 in cash a few days before his death. Prosecutors allege that included the doses that killed Perry.",

      "A guitar once played by two members of the Rolling Stones is at the center of a dispute between the band\u2019s former guitarist Mick Taylor and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",
      "The 1959 Gibson Les Paul was donated to the Met as part of what the New York museum calls \u201ca landmark gift of more than 500 of the finest guitars from the golden age of American guitar making.\u201d The donor is Dirk Ziff, a billionaire investor and guitar collector.",
      "When the Met announced the gift in May, Taylor thought he recognized the guitar, with its distinctive \u201cstarburst\u201d finish, as an instrument he last saw in 1971, when the Stones were recording the album \u201cExile on Main St.\u201d at Keith Richards\u2019 rented villa in the south of France.",

      "\u201cThis guitar has a long and well-documented history of ownership,\u201d museum spokesperson Ann Bailis said.",
      "Taylor\u2019s partner and business manager, Marlies Damming, said the Met should make the guitar \u201cavailable for inspection.\u201d",
      "\u201cAn independent guitar expert should be able to ascertain the guitar\u2019s provenance one way or the other,\u201d she said in a statement Tuesday to The Associated Press.",
      "While its ownership is contested, there\u2019s no disputing the instrument\u2019s starring role in rock history. It was owned in the early 1960s by Keith Richards, who played it during the Rolling Stones\u2019 first appearance on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show\u201d in 1964. The Met says that performance \u201cignited interest in this legendary model.\u201d",
      "The guitar \u2013 nicknamed the \u201cKeithburst\u201d \u2013 was also played by guitar legends Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. Taylor says he got it from Richards in 1967, two years before he joined the Stones, replacing original member Brian Jones. Jones died in 1969.",

      "Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d at the Santa Fe Opera House",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre.\u201d",
      "Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge.",
      "And indeed the part of Wotan, one of the most demanding roles in opera for a dramatic bass-baritone, seems to inspire mountain imagery. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it \u201cthe Mount Everest for this particular voice type.\u201d To Green, \u201cIt feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.\u201d",
      "Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he\u2019s come.",
      "Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star.",
      "\u201cI never thought it would happen, that my career would blow up the way it has,\u201d Green said in an interview between performances, which continue through Aug. 21.",
      "The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d the second of the four operas in Wagner\u2019s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods.",
      "It calls for a wide dramatic range \u2014 from exuberance, to despair, from fury to compassion. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson.",
      "\u201cMy Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m getting my first whack at it at 39.\u201d",
      "Even in this first outing, his performance drew bravos from the audience and critics.",
      "\u201cGreen \u2026 portrayed the troubled god as if he had been doing it for years,\u201d wrote Harvey Steiman on Seen and Heard International. \u201cSensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.\u201d",
      "Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of \u201cDas Rheingold,\u201d the opening \u201cRing\u201d installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment he walked onstage, everyone sensed his God-like presence,\u201d Dudamel said in an email to the AP. \u201cWhen he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen I sang my first Wotan, it was the first time I played a character who doesn\u2019t have to worry about what anybody else thinks of him.\u201d",
      "Green will perform the \u201cWalk\u00fcre\u201d Wotan again next spring with Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic and will play Wotan in a new \u201cRing\u201d cycle at the Metropolitan Opera set to launch in the 2027-28 season, Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the AP.",
      "Among his colleagues, Green is known for his relentless work ethic and perfectionism.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s extremely hard on himself,\u201d said Gaffigan, who is conducting the Santa Fe performances and recalled the first time he heard from Green after he was cast.",
      "\u201cHe called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,\u201d Gaffigan said, \u201cAnd from the first words on the telephone, he said, \u2018I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?\u2019 \u2026 I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn\u2019t give up on getting this time.",
      "\u201cThe dedication to the text and the music and the rhythms is at the highest level of preparation I\u2019ve heard in a long time,\u201d Gaffigan added. \u201cHe knows how serious this is. It\u2019s a major ascent in his career.\u201d",
      "Green laughs when reminded of that phone call and mentions how he had prepared for his first Wagner role more than a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt was the Second Knight in \u2018Parsifal\u2019 ... and I was rehearsing for three months for a role that literally has 61 seconds of music,\u201d Green said..",
      "\u201cI was like, this is at the Met, I need to be perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of mentality has been my saving grace, because I put everything I\u2019ve got into it, vocally, physically, mentally.\u201d",

      "The body-swappers are back",
      "It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2014 or at least, a tale Hollywood loves to tell again and again: Body-swapping. It\u2019s magical. It\u2019s comical. It carries heartwarming messages about walking in another\u2019s shoes, and learning about oneself along the way.",
      "So it\u2019s hardly surprising that \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the 2003 version of the 1972 Mary Rodgers novel starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, was a hit. Lohan was endearing and charismatic as an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager, and Curtis was a comic hoot as her control-freak therapist mom.",
      "And while there were a few misfires \u2014 the stereotypical Asian representation has aged badly \u2014 the film was powered by an easy chemistry between the two stars. So why not revisit the story in 2025? Sequels are often made for far less compelling reasons.",
      "The chief weakness of \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d \u2014 which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. The comedy is thus a bit more manic, and the plot machinations more overwrought (or sometimes distractingly silly).",
      "Then there's the double body-swapping. Because one major swap isn't enough, here we have two sets of swappers \u2014 a quixotic quartet of lives disrupted during the lead-up to, yes, another wedding! The problem is that sometimes, it\u2019s actually hard to keep track of who\u2019s inhabiting whom, and therefore why they're doing what.",
      "Not to say that \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d directed with gusto by Nisha Ganatra, doesn't have moments of comic glee. I\u2019ll admit to laughing out loud \u2014 with everyone else older than 30 near me \u2014 when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: \u201cIt\u2019s like a database of old people!\u201d Touch\u00e9, guys.",
      "These \u201cyoungsters\u201d are actually Lohan and Curtis, playing ninth-graders trapped in adult bodies. Before we get to that, though: We begin 22 years after we last saw Lohan\u2019s Anna, playing electric guitar at her mom's wedding. Now a single mom herself with a job managing a young pop star, she's trying to get her daughter up for school. Harper (the excellent Julia Butters) is \u2014 surprise! \u2014 an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager. And just like Anna two decades ago, she keeps people out of her bedroom. \u201cPrepare to be triggered!\u201d Anna yells before barging in. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.)",
      "Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is \u201cRebelling with Respect.\u201d Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out \u201cMake good choices!\u201d \u2014 just what mom Tess used to say, natch.",
      "At school, Harper butts heads with transfer student Lily (Sophia Hammons), a budding fashion designer who hails from Britain and is very snooty. Anna is called to see the principal. There, she meets Lily\u2019s dishy chef dad Eric (Manny Jacinto), and the two flirt so intensely, the principal herself makes them a dinner reservation.",
      "All it takes is one cute dating montage, and poof, Anna and Eric are engaged. But things are still bad between Harper and Lily, whose animosity triggers a weirdly violent, all-school food fight on bake sale day. But they all have a bachelorette party to attend. There, a wacky fortune-teller and barista and business-card maker \u2014 Vanessa Bayer, in a cameo that perhaps, no definitely goes on too long \u2014 reads their palms. And then the earth starts shaking.",
      "\u201cFreaky\u201d fans know what happens next. The four awaken the next morning, each inhabiting someone else. Anna is Harper. Tess is Lily. Harper is Anna. Lily is Tess. We\u2019ll be testing you on this later!",

Meanwhile Anna and Tess, in their teen bodies, feast on junk food with impunity. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten real dairy since the Bush administration,\u201d one says.",
      "Curtis, aka Lily, gets her best moment in a drugstore, when her hubby asks her to get supplies from the \u201csenior\u201d aisle, and she stockpiles everything from adult diapers to enemas.

She\u2019s flirting with Jake (Chad Michael Murray) \u2014 yes, the hunky guy from the original \u2014 and her flirting is so weird, Jake thinks she's having a stroke.",
      "It all barrels toward a conclusion that we won\u2019t spoil. Will the wedding be derailed by the efforts of Lily and Harper? Will that derailment be temporary? Will the sisters-to-be reach an understanding? Will Lohan get to play the electric guitar? Will everyone grow to appreciate each other?",
      "That last question, we can answer. Of course they will. Whoever they are, and whatever they just did.",

      "And she had a number of country hits in the \u201860s and \u201970s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \u201cDon't Touch Me,\u201d 1967's \u201cI'll Love You More (Than You Need)\u201d and 1973's \u201cCan I Sleep In Your Arms?\u201d, adapted from the folk song \u201cCan I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\u201d",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform, and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones, and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \u201cSunday\u2019s with Seely\u201d on Willie Nelson's Willie\u2019s Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her latest song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \u201cSuffertime,\u201d recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police.",

      "It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?",
      "This is \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d \u2014 the gnawing sense that one\u2019s life should have an overarching purpose, but it\u2019s unclear how to discover it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,\u201d said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.",
      "The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?",
      "Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help \u201cclose that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,\u201d he said.",
      "People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.",
      "There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.",
      "But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.",
      "The term \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a \u201cpurposeful life.\u201d It is, she said in one interview, \u201cthe formula we\u2019ve all been fed.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut a lot of the places that we\u2019ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.\u201d",

      "Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don\u2019t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.",

      "Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. All seven media witnesses to the execution agreed he appeared to be in discomfort. Throughout the execution, a spiritual adviser prayed and sang over Black, at one point touching his face.",

      "She said she was especially concerned about his head movement and complaints of pain because the massive dose of pentobarbital used to kill inmates is supposed to rapidly leave them unconscious.",
      "\u201cThe fact that he was able to raise his head several times and express pain tells you that the pentobarbital was not acting the way the state's experts claim it acts,\u201d Henry said.",

      "It was Tennessee\u2019s second execution since May, after a pause for five years, first because of COVID-19 and then because of missteps by state corrections officials.",
      "Twenty-eight men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and nine other people are scheduled to be put to death in seven states during the remainder of 2025. The number of executions this year exceeds the 25 carried out last year and in 2018. It is the highest total since 2015, when 28 people were put to death.",
      "Black had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, which is a small, battery-powered electronic device that is surgically implanted in the chest.

      "His attorneys have said that if they had delayed a prior attempt to seek his intellectual disability claim, he would have been spared under a 2021 state law.

      "The World Health Organization has closed in on its bold goal of eradicating polio several times, but the paralytic virus is entrenched in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan",
      "KARACHI, Pakistan -- For the past decade, Sughra Ayaz has traveled door to door in southeastern Pakistan, pleading with parents to allow children to be vaccinated against polio as part of a global campaign to wipe out the paralytic disease. She hears their demands and fears. Some are practical \u2013 families need basics like food and water more than vaccines. Others are simply unfounded \u2013 the oral doses are meant to sterilize their kids.",
      "Amid rampant misinformation and immense pressure for the campaign to succeed, Ayaz said, some managers have instructed workers to falsely mark children as immunized. And the vaccines, which must be kept cold, aren\u2019t always stored correctly, she added.",
      "\u201cIn many places, our work is not done with honesty,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "The World Health Organization and partners embarked on their polio campaign in 1988 with the bold goal of eradication \u2014 a feat seen only once for human diseases, with smallpox in 1980. They came close several times, including in 2021, when just five cases of the natural virus were reported in Pakistanand Afghanistan. But since then, cases rebounded, hitting 99 last year, and officials have missed at least six self-imposed eradication deadlines.",
      "Afghanistan and Pakistan remain the only countries where transmission of polio \u2014 which is highly infectious, affects mainly children under 5, and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours -- has never been interrupted. The worldwide campaign has focused most of its attention and funding there for the past decade.",
      "But in its quest to eliminate the disease, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has been derailed by mismanagement and what insiders describe as blind allegiance to an outdated strategy and a problematic oral vaccine, according to workers, polio experts and internal materials obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "Officials have falsified vaccination records, selected unqualified people to dole out drops, failed to send out teams during mass campaigns, and dismissed concerns about the oral vaccinesparking outbreaks, according to documents shared with AP by staffers from GPEI \u2013 one of the largest and most expensive public health campaigns in history, with over $20 billion spent and nearly every country in the world involved.",
      "In Afghanistan and Pakistan \u2013 which share a border, harbor widespread mistrust of vaccines, and have weakened healthcare systems and infrastructure \u2013 local staffers like Ayaz have for years flagged problems to senior managers. But those issues, along with concerns by staffers and outside health officials, have long gone unaddressed, insiders say.",
      "Officials tout the successes \u2013 3 billion children vaccinated, an estimated 20 million people who would have been paralyzed spared \u2013 while acknowledging challenges in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Remote villages are hard to reach, some cultural and religious authorities instruct against vaccination, and hundreds of polio workers and security staff have been killed because of their alignment with a Western-led initiative.",
      "Dr. Jamal Ahmed, WHO\u2019s polio director, defended progress in those two countries, citing workers\u2019 tailored response in resistant pockets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many children being protected today because of the work that was done over the past 40 years,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not overdramatize the challenges, because that leads to children getting paralyzed.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he believes authorities will end the spread of polio in the next 12 to 18 months. Its latest goal for eradication is 2029. The campaign says about 45 million children in Pakistan and 11 million in Afghanistan must be vaccinated this year. Children typically need four doses of two drops each to be considered fully immunized.",
      "Dr. Zulfiqar Bhutta, who has served on advisory groups for WHO, the Gates Foundation and others, said campaign officials should listen to the criticism of its tactics.",
      "\u201cContinuing blindly with the same strategies that we have relied on since eradication began is unlikely to lead to a different result,\u201d he said.",
      "Internal WHO reports reviewing vaccination drives in Afghanistan and Pakistan over the past decade \u2013 given to AP by current and former staffers \u2013 show that as early as 2017, local workers were alerting significant problems to senior managers.",
      "The documents flagged multiple cases of falsified vaccination records, health workers being replaced by untrained relatives and workers improperly administering vaccines.",
      "On numerous occasions, WHO officials noted, \u201cvaccinators did not know about vaccine management,\u201d citing failure to keep doses properly cold. They also found sloppy or falsified reporting, with workers noting \u201cmore used vaccine vials than were actually supplied.\u201d",
      "According to an August 2017 report from Kandahar, Afghanistan, local government authorities and others interfered in choosing vaccinators, \u201cresulting in the selection of underage and illiterate volunteers.\u201d",
      "Vaccination teams worked \u201cin a hurried manner,\u201d reports said, with \u201cno plan for monitoring or supervision.\u201d A team in Nawzad, Afghanistan, covered just half of the intended area in 2017, with 250 households missed entirely. Village elders said no one visited for at least two years.",
      "Vaccine workers and health officials in Afghanistan and Pakistan confirmed the issues in the documents and told AP it\u2019s hard for campaign leadership to grasp the difficulties in the field. Door-to-door efforts are stymied by cultural barriers, unfounded stories about vaccines, and the region\u2019s poverty and transience.",
      "\u201cMost of the time when we go to vaccinate and knock on the door, the head of the house or the man is not at home,\u201d said one worker, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to talk to the press. \u201cMany people find it offensive that a stranger knocks on the door and talks to a woman.\u201d",
      "Some workers find families have moved. Occasionally, they say, the encounter abuse.",
      "\u201cWe have shared these problems with our senior officials,\u201d the worker told AP. \u201cThey know about it.\u201d",
      "In an email response to AP\u2019s questions about officials\u2019 knowledge of the issues, WHO polio director Ahmed noted \u201coperational challenges\u201d in Afghanistan and Pakistan and said the program has \u201crobust monitoring and evaluation processes.\u201d",
      "Worker Ayaz described \u201cfake finger marking\u201d \u2014 placing the ink used to show a child is vaccinated on their pinky even when no vaccine has been given.",
      "\u201cThere is so much pressure,\u201d Ayaz said.",
      "Before the first polio vaccine was developed in 1955, the disease \u2014 spread mostly from person to person, through contaminated water and via fecal particles \u2014 was among the world\u2019s most feared, paralyzing hundreds of thousands of children annually. People avoided crowded places during epidemics, and hospital wards filled with children encased in iron lungs after the virus immobilized their breathing muscles.",
      "Polio is mainly spread when people are exposed to water infected with the virus. In countries with poor sanitation, children often become infected when they come into contact with contaminated waste.",
      "WHO says that as long as a single child remains infected, kids everywhere are at risk.",
      "Eradication demands near-perfection \u2013 zero polio cases and immunizing more than 95% of children.",

      "The oral vaccine \u2013 proven to be safe and effective \u2014 has been given to more than 3 billion children. But there are some extremely rare side effects: Scientists estimate that for every 2.7 million first doses given, one child will be paralyzed by the live polio virus in the vaccine.",
      "In even rarer instances, the live virus can mutate into a form capable of starting new outbreaks among unimmunized people where vaccination rates are low.",
      "Worldwide, several hundred vaccine-derived cases have been reported annually since at least 2021, with at least 98 this year.",
      "Most public health experts agree the oral vaccine should be pulled as soon as possible. But they acknowledge there simply isn\u2019t enough injectable vaccine \u2014 which uses no live virus and doesn\u2019t come with the risks of the oral vaccine \u2014 to wipe out polio alone. The injectable vaccine also is more expensive and requires more training to administer.",
      "More than two dozen current and former senior polio officials told AP the agencies involved haven\u2019t been willing to even consider revising their strategy to account for some of the campaign\u2019s problems.",
      "Dr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who sits on an independent board reviewing polio eradication, said it would be impossible to eliminate polio without the oral vaccine. But he\u2019s urged authorities to find ways to adapt, such as adopting new methods to identify polio cases more quickly. Since 2011, he and colleagues have issued regular reports about overall program failures.",

      "\u201cWHO is persisting with polio control and creating polio with one hand and attempting to control it by the other,\u201d John wrote.",
      "In his response to AP, WHO polio director Ahmed said the oral vaccine is a \u201ccore pillar\u201d of eradication strategy and that \u201calmost every country that is polio-free today used (it) to achieve that milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need to step back and really care for the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only way we can do that in large parts of the world is with oral polio vaccine.\u201d",
      "Ahmed also pointed to the success WHO and partners had eliminating polio from India, once considered a nearly impossible task. In the four years before polio was wiped out there, health workers delivered about 1 billion doses of the oral vaccine to more than 170 million children.",
      "Today, nearly all of the world\u2019s polio cases -- mostly in Africa and the Middle East -- are mutated viruses from the oral vaccine, except for Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "Scott Barrett, a Columbia University professor, called for an inquiry into how things went so wrong \u2013 particularly with a failed effort in 2016, when authorities removed a strain from the oral vaccine. They miscalculated, leading to outbreaks in more than 40 countries that paralyzed more than 3,000 children, according to an expert report commissioned by WHO. Last year, a mutated virus traced to that effort paralyzed a baby in Gaza.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a public inquiry where all the evidence comes out and WHO makes serious changes, it will be very hard to trust them,\u201d he said.",
      "With an annual budget of about $1 billion, the polio initiative is among the most expensive in all of public health. This year, the U.S. withdrew from WHO, and President Donald Trump has cut foreign aid. WHO officials have privately admitted that sustaining funding would be difficult without success.",
      "Some say the money would be better spent on other health needs.",
      "\u201cWe have spent more than $1 billion (in external polio funding) in the last five years in Pakistan alone, and it didn\u2019t buy us any progress,\u201d said Roland Sutter, who formerly led polio research at WHO. \u201cIf this was a private company, we would demand results.\u201d",
      "Villagers, too, have protested the cost, staging hundreds of boycotts of immunization campaigns since 2023. Instead of polio vaccines, they ask for medicine, food and electricity.",

Workers are accompanied by armed guards; Pakistani authorities say more than 200 workers and police assigned to protect them have been killed since the 1990s, mostly by militants.",
      "The campaign also is up against a wave of misinformation, including that the vaccine is made from pig urine or will make children reach puberty early. Some blame an anti-vaccine sentiment growing in the U.S. and other countries that have largely funded eradication efforts and say it\u2019s reaching even remote areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
      "In suburban southwest Pakistan, Saleem Khan, 58, said two grandchildren under 5 were vaccinated over his family\u2019s objections.",
      "\u201cIt results in disability,\u201d said Khan, without citing evidence for his belief. \u201cThey are vaccinated because officials reported our refusal to authorities and the police.\u201d",
      "Svea Closser, professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University, said Pakistan and Afghanistan were less resistant to immunization decades ago. Now, people are angry about the focus on polio and lack of help for diseases like measles or tuberculosis, she said, spurring conspiracy theories.",

      "Three new studies highlight the severe health impacts of recent wildfires on Maui and in Los Angeles",
      "NEW YORK -- The toll of wildfires is usually counted in acres burnt, property destroyed and lives lost to smoke and flames. But three studies published Wednesday suggest the cost to human health from the Maui and Los Angeles wildfires was substantially higher.",
      "Two of the papers explore what happened after the Hawaii fire in August 2023 \u2014 one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires in a century. A third looks at the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year.",
      "The Maui fire was directly blamed for more than 100 deaths. But it also left 1 in 5 with lung damage and as many as half with symptoms of depression, the new research found. The month of the fire saw 13 suicide and overdose deaths, translating to nearly double the normal suicide and overdose death rates.",
      "The study of the Los Angeles fires concluded that in addition to at least 30 deaths attributed to the fire, more than 400 other deaths could be blamed on the event, due to interruptions in health care and other factors.",
      "The studies, published in two American Medical Association journals, add \"a really important piece to the understanding of the true health risks from these extreme climatic events,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a University of Wisconsin environmental public health researcher who was not involved in the papers.",
      "The results conform with existing understanding of the effects of extreme weather events, some experts said.",
      "How to track the indirect impacts of disastrous events has been a continuing subject of academic research and even legislative proposals. There have been estimates of deaths caused by extreme heat, as well as research into the large-scale toll of wildfires driven by climate change.",
      "\u201cBut this hones in, especially on (specific) fires,\u201d Patz said.",
      "One of the studies, co-led by Ruben Juarez of the University of Hawaii, looked at more than 1,100 adults six to 14 months after the Maui fire. It found lower lung function in people in areas close to the fire compared with those in lower-exposure areas. Overall, about 22% had below-normal lung function.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a stark reminder that wildfires can leave an invisible but lasting scar on respiratory health, long after the flames are gone,\u201d Juarez said, in an email, noting that this Friday marks the two-year anniversary of the fire.",
      "Patz called the finding \u201can important new contribution.\u201d",

      "Jonathan Purtle of New York University was the lead author of another study, which calculated rates of suicide and overdose deaths in Maui and Hawaii's four other counties. That research team found a 97% increase in suicides and overdose death rates on Maui during the month of the wildfires. The total number of suicide and overdose deaths was 13 that month \u2014 most of them suicides. That's a significant increase, Ebi said.",
      "They also found a 46% increase in such deaths in all five counties, which may have been influenced by displaced Maui residents migrating to other islands, the authors said.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency plans to relax rules aimed at reducing auto tailpipe emissions",
      "DETROIT -- The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.",
      "As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",
      "The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook \u2014 repealing fines for automakers that don\u2019t meet federal fuel economy standards.",
      "Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don\u2019t meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don\u2019t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.",
      "That is all set to go away under the new law.",
      "Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California\u2019s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.",
      "It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation \u2014 which also includes ships, trains and planes \u2014 is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.",
      "Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation\u2019s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.",
      "The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.",
      "Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 \u2014 they're currently at about 8% \u2014 along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.",
      "The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.",
      "But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden\u2019s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.",
      "Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.",
      "\u201cWith the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,\u201d NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.",
      "Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.",

      "Elon Musk sharply criticized the big tax-and-spending bill in June, saying it \u201cgives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.\u201d Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the law's effect on those credits.",
      "The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn\u2019t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.",
      "Experts say without them, the law \u201cinvites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.",
      "Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a \u201cstunning decision\u201d for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.",
      "Carlson said backing away from future fines also \u201cposes a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.\u201d",
      "It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years. But changes could come for model year 2027 and beyond, they said.",
      "EVs aren't as profitable as gas-engine cars, so automakers may make fewer of them if they no longer have to offset emissions from their gasoline models. Already, some automakers have pulled back on their ambitions to go all-electric with a slower pace of EV sales growth.",
      "\u201cAutomakers also know every presidential administration eventually comes to an end, so they won\u2019t abandon their EV development efforts,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com. \"But they will reduce their near-term efforts in this area.\u201d",

      "U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates inched down again last year and the proportion of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. kindergarten vaccination rates inched down again last year and the share of children with exemptions rose to an all-time high, according to federal data posted Thursday.",
      "The fraction of kids exempted from vaccine requirements rose to 4.1%, up from 3.7% the year before. It's the third record-breaking year in a row for the exemption rate, and the vast majority are parents withholding shots for nonmedical reasons.",
      "Meanwhile, 92.5% of 2024-25 kindergartners got their required measles-mumps-rubella shots, down slightly from the previous year. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the vaccination rate was 95% \u2014 the level that makes it unlikely that a single infection will spark a disease cluster or outbreak.",
      "The vaccination numbers were posted as the U.S. experiences its worst year for measles spread in more than three decades, with more than 1,300 cases so far.",
      "\u201cThe concern, of course, is that with a further dip in the (vaccination) coverage, we\u2019re going to see even more measles in the coming months,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "It's possible that this year's outbreaks may spur more parents to get their children vaccinated before they go to school, said O'Leary, a University of Colorado pediatric infectious diseases specialist.",
      "But Dr. Philip Huang isn't optimistic. Texas was particularly hard hits by measles this year, with more than half of the cases reported nationally. Despite that, the state passed a law making it easier for parents to get school vaccine exemptions for their kids.",
      "\u201cIt's crazy,\u201d said Huang, Dallas County's health director.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention traditionally releases the vaccination coverage data in its flagship publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. CDC officials usually speak to the trends and possible explanations, and stress the importance of vaccinations. This year, the agency quietly posted the data online and \u2014 when asked about it \u2014 emailed a statement.",
      "\u201cThe decision to vaccinate is a personal one. Parents should consult their health care providers on options for their families,\u201d the statement said, adding; \u201cVaccination remains the most effective way to protect children from serious diseases like measles and whooping cough, which can lead to hospitalization and long-term health complications.\u201d",
      "The wording is more ambivalent about the importance of vaccinations than in the past. That is in keeping with communications from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before President Donald Trump put him in charge of federal health agencies.",
      "O'Leary noted the changes in the CDC messaging, which places personal choice before community protection.",

      "\u201cTo sort of weaken the language or weaken the messaging that they're sending is very concerning, because what they say does matter,\u201d he said.",
      "Public health officials focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and launching pads for community outbreaks.",
      "For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to school attendance mandates that required key vaccinations. All U.S. states and territories require that children attending child care centers and schools be vaccinated against a number of diseases, including, measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox.",
      "All states allow exemptions for children with medical conditions that prevent them from receiving certain vaccines. And most also permit exemptions for religious or other nonmedical reasons.",
      "In the last decade, the percentage of kindergartners with medical exemptions has held steady, at about 0.2%. But the percentage with nonmedical exemptions has risen.",
      "The rates can be influenced by policies that make it harder or easier to obtain exemptions, and by local attitudes among families and doctors about the need to get children vaccinated. Online misinformation and the political divide that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines have led more parents to question routine childhood vaccinations, experts say.",
      "According to the CDC data, 15.4% of kindergartners had an exemption to one or more vaccines in Idaho in the last school year. But fewer than 0.5% did in Connecticut.",
      "It\u2019s good news that the vast majority of parents continue to get their kids vaccinated, O\u2019Leary said. And it\u2019s noteworthy that there is a gap between the percentage vaccinated and the percentage who are exempted \u2014 meaning there likely are unmet access issues, he added.",

      "A bipartisan program in Michigan aims to address the high costs of parenting by giving mothers thousands of dollars in cash with no strings attached",
      "FLINT, Mich. -- A procession of mothers wearing red sashes, pushing strollers and tending to toddlers made their way Friday to a little festival in Flint, Michigan, where families received diapers and kids played.",
      "It was called a \u201cbaby parade.\u201d",
      "The sashes indicated the women were participants of a growing program in Michigan that helps pregnant women and new moms by giving them cash over the first year of their children's lives. Launched in 2024, the program comes at a time when many voters worry over high child care costs and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration floats policy to reverse the declining birth rate.",
      "Backed by a mix of state, local and philanthropic money, Rx Kids gives mothers of newborns up to $7,500, with no income requirements and no rules for how the money is spent. Supporters believe the program could be a model for mitigating the high cost of having children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\u201d said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",
      "To qualify, women need to prove they live in a participating location and that they are pregnant, but don\u2019t have to share details about their income.",
      "It's designed to be simple.",
      "Pregnant women receive $1,500 before delivery and $500 every month for the first six to 12 months of their babies\u2019 lives, depending on the program location.",
      "Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician and the program's founding director, said that window is a time of great economic vulnerability for new parents \u2014 and a critical developmental period for babies.",
      "Most participants need diapers, formula, breast feeding supplies and baby clothes but every family's needs are different. The monthly payment can also help buy food and cover rent, utilities and transportation.",
      "For some moms, the extra cash allows them to afford child care and return to work. For others, it allows them to stay home longer.",
      "The program so far is available in Flint, Pontiac, Kalamazoo and five counties in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. By fall, it will expand to a rural central Michigan county and several cities near Detroit.",
      "Hanna said the main piece of feedback she hears is that the program should be bigger. She\u2019s heard from lawmakers and others hoping to start similar programs in other states.",
      "Hanna said the program's data shows nearly all pregnant women in Flint have signed up since it became available.",
      "The locations were designed to target low-income families, though there is no income requirement. Luke Shaefer, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a co-founder of Rx Kids, said they wanted to eliminate any stigma or barriers that discourage people from signing up.",
      "The founders also want mothers to feel celebrated, hence the parade Friday.",
      "\u201cFor so long moms have been vilified and not supported,\u201d Hanna said.",
      "Friends told Angela Sintery, 44, about Rx Kids when she found out she was pregnant with her second child. She's a preschool teacher who spread the word to other parents.",
      "Sintery had her first daughter 19 years before her second and had to buy all new baby supplies.",
      "She said the cash provided by Rx Kids would have been helpful when she had her first child at age 24, before she went to college.",
      "\u201cSo this time around, I didn\u2019t have to stress about anything. I just had to worry about my baby,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cI see philanthropy as the doula of this program, they are helping birth it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are helping us prove that this is possible.\u201d",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",
      "Even Damoose, among the program's top backers, said he doesn't think Michigan can afford statewide expansion yet. But the lawmaker who represents parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan does want to keep growing it.",
      "For fellow Republicans who oppose abortion as he does, the approach is a \u201cno brainer\u201d way to help pregnant women, Damoose said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been accused for years and years, and not without cause, of being pro-birth, but not pro-life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is.\u201d",

      "That\u2019s not available until children grow up and is more focused on building wealth rather than immediate relief, Hanna said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have that social infrastructure to invest in our families,\u201d Hanna said. \u201cNo wonder people aren\u2019t having children and our birth rates are going down.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has also toyed with the idea of giving families one-time $5,000 \u201cbaby bonuses,\u201d a policy similar to Rx Kids.",
      "Critics have rightly pointed out that doesn't come close to covering the cost of child care or other expenses. Defenders of a cash-in-hand approach, though, say any amount can help in those critical early months.",

Late on Monday, the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs condemned the far-right leader's order for house arrest and attacked de Moraes.",
      "Since de Moraes\u2019 order, Bolsonaro allies are pledging to stop congress unless an amnesty bill is passed in favor of the far-right leader and his supporters involved in the coup plot probe.",
      "Early on Tuesday, a group of 40 pro-Bolsonaro lawmakers told journalists in the capital Brasilia they will push hard for the former president's release. Altineu Cortes, the conservative deputy speaker of the lower house, said he will put the amnesty bill to a vote if he gets the chance.",
      "\u201cI've already told speaker Hugo Motta that I will do that in the first moment I am working as the speaker of the house during one of his trips abroad,\u201d Cortes said.",
      "Later, many of the same lawmakers protested in the lower house and the senate by blocking access to the presiding tables.",
      "\"This is an arbitrary action,\u201d said Sen. Davi Alcolumbre, the president of Brazil's senate. \u201cI call for serenity and spirit of cooperation. We need to start working with respect, civility and dialogue so congress can fulfill its mission in favor of Brazil and our population.\u201d",

      "Meanwhile, Lula and his allies initially showed they wanted to move past the issue of Bolsonaro's house arrest and focus on trade negotiations with Trump, who imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian import goods starting Wednesday. Trump's justification for the measure was what he called unfair treatment of the far-right leader.",

      "The wife of South Korea\u2019s ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol has appeared for questioning by a special prosecutor, as investigators expanded a probe into suspicions of stock manipulation, bribery, and interference in party nominations",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The wife of South Korea\u2019s ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol appeared for questioning by a special prosecutor Wednesday, as investigators expanded a probe into suspicions of stock manipulation, bribery, and interference in party nominations.",
      "The investigation into Kim Keon Hee is one of three separate special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul\u2019s new liberal government targeting the presidency of Yoon, who was removed from office in April and rearrested last month over his brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "The conservative's abrupt and poorly planned power grab on Dec. 3 came during a seemingly routine standoff with the liberals, whom he described as \u201canti-state\u201d forces abusing their legislative majority to obstruct his agenda. Some political opponents have questioned whether Yoon's actions were at least partly motivated by growing allegations against his wife, which hurt his approval ratings and gave political ammunition to his rivals.",
      "\u201cI apologize for causing concern to the people, even though I am someone insignificant,\u201d Kim told reporters as she arrived for questioning. She added that she would sincerely cooperate with the investigation, before walking away without responding to specific questions about the allegations.",
      "The team of investigators led by Special Prosecutor Min Joong-ki said Kim was questioned for about seven hours until Wednesday afternoon, but they didn\u2019t specify whether she will be summoned again. Investigators said they haven't decided whether they would seek her arrest.",
      "Through a heavy police presence, dozens of Yoon\u2019s supporters gathered outside the special prosecutor\u2019s office in downtown Seoul, waving South Korean and U.S. flags and banners in light rain.",
      "Yoon, who was sent back to prison last month and faces a high-stakes trial on rebellion and other charges, resisted an attempt by investigators last week to compel him for questioning over his wife. Investigators said he took off his prison uniform and laid down on the floor of his cell in his underwear before they gave up executing the warrant to detain him. They plan to negotiate with Yoon\u2019s lawyers to arrange a possible questioning.",

      "Kim is separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received a necklace and other gifts through a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, as well as possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme. While in office, Yoon repeatedly dismissed calls to investigate his wife, denouncing them as baseless political attacks.",
      "Yoon\u2019s martial law decree lasted only hours, after a quorum of lawmakers managed to break through a blockade of heavily armed soldiers and voted to revoke the measure. He was impeached by lawmakers on Dec. 14 and was formally removed from office by the Constitutional Court in April.",
      "Shortly after winning the early presidential election in June, new liberal President Lee Jae Myung approved legislation to launch sweeping special investigations into Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle, the allegations against his wife, and the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a flood rescue operation, an incident Lee\u2019s Democratic Party claims Yoon\u2019s government tried to cover up.",
      "Yoon had been released from prison in March after the Seoul Central District Court overturned his January arrest, but the same court approved his new arrest in July, accepting a special prosecutor\u2019s claim that he poses a risk of destroying evidence.",

      "The U.S. has suspended live cattle imports from Mexico due to concerns about the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite found in southern Mexico",
      "HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States\u2019 suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Mart\u00edn Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border.",
      "Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July \u2013 the third suspension of the past eight months \u2014 due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals\u2019 skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a \"devastating pest\" and said in June that it poses a threat to \u201cour livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.",
      "As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.",
      "The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.",
      "For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora\u2019s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.",
      "The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times.",
      "\u201cTiempos de vacas flacas\" \u2014 times of the lean cows \u2014 as he calls them.",
      "\u201cAt least it lets us continue\u201d ranching, the 57-year-old said with a white cowboy hat perched on his head.",
      "Even as ranchers in Sonora intensify their efforts to make sure the parasitic fly never makes it into their state, they\u2019ve had to seek new markets.",
      "In the past two months, they\u2019ve sold more than 35,000 mature cows within Mexico at a significant loss.",

      "The U.S. first suspended cattle imports last November. Since then, more than 2,258 cases of screwworm have been identified in Mexico. Treatment requires a mix of manually removing the maggots, healing the lesions on the cows and using anti-parasite medicine.",

      "The recent two-year drought reduced his cattle stocks and forced him to take on debt to save the small family ranch that has survived for three generations.",
      "Juan Carlos Anaya, director of Agricultural Markets Consulting Group, attributed a 2% drop in Mexico\u2019s cattle inventory last year to the drought.",
      "Anaya said Mexican ranchers who export are trying to get the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, \u201cbut the damage is already done.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re running out of time,\u201d said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business.

    "story": [
      "Last month, floods along the Nepal-China border that killed nine people also destroyed important infrastructure, washing out the primary bridge connecting the two nations and halting trade",
      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- Floods that damaged hydropower dams in Nepal and destroyed the main bridge connecting the country to China show the vulnerability of infrastructure and need for smart rebuilding in a region bearing the brunt of a warming planet, experts say.",
      "The flooding of the Bhotekoshi River on July 8 also killed nine people and damaged an inland container depot that was being built to support increasing trade between the two countries. The 10 damaged hydropower facilities, including three under construction, have a combined capacity that could power 600,000 South Asian homes.",
      "Another smaller flood in the area on July 30 damaged roads and structures, but caused less overall destruction. Elsewhere in the Himalayas, flash floods swept away roads, homes and hotels on Tuesday in northern India, killing at least four people and leaving many others trapped under debris, officials said.",
      "The Himalayan region, which crosses Nepal and several nearby countries including India, is especially vulnerable to heavy rains, floods and landslides because the area is warming up faster than the rest of the world due to human-caused climate change. Climate experts say the increasing frequency of extreme weather has changed the playbook for assessing infrastructure risks while also increasing the need for smart rebuilding plans.",
      "\u201cThe statistics of the past no longer apply for the future,\u201d said John Pomeroy, a hydrologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. \u201cThe risk that goes into building a bridge or other infrastructure is generally based on historical observations of past risk, but this is no longer useful because future risk is different and often much higher.\u201d",
      "While damage estimates from the July floods in the Rasuwa region are still being calculated, past construction costs give a sense of the financial toll. The Sino-Nepal Friendship Bridge alone, for example, took $68 million to rebuild after it was destroyed by a 2015 earthquake that ravaged Nepal.",
      "The latest disaster has also stoked fears of long-lasting economic damage in a region north of the capital city Kathmandu that spent years rebuilding after the 2015 quake. Nepali government officials estimate that $724 million worth of trade with China is conducted over the bridge each year, and that has come to a standstill.",
      "\u201cThank God there wasn\u2019t much damage to local villages, but the container depot and bridges have been completely destroyed. This has severely affected workers, hotel operators, laborers, and truck drivers who rely on cross-border trade for their livelihoods,\u201d said Kaami Tsering, a local government official, in a phone interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Among those affected is Urken Tamang, a 50-year-old parking attendant at the depot who has been out of work for several weeks. A small tea shop he runs nearby with his family has also suffered.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been unlucky,\u201d said Tamang, a former farmer who sold his land and changed jobs when work on the depot began. He added: \u201cThe whole area was severely damaged by the 2015 earthquake, and just when life was slowly returning to normal, this devastating flood struck.\"",
      "The Nepal floods are the latest in a series of disasters in South Asia during this year\u2019s monsoon season. Research has shown that extreme weather has become more frequent in the region including heat waves, heavy rains and melting glaciers.",
      "Climate experts said smart planning and rebuilding in climate-vulnerable regions must include accounting for multiple risks, installing early warning systems, preparing local communities for disasters and, when needed, relocating infrastructure.",
      "\u201cWhat we have to avoid is the insanity of rebuilding after a natural disaster in the same place where it occurred and where we know it will occur again at even higher probability,\" said Pomeroy, the Canadian hydrologist. \"That\u2019s a very poor decision. Unfortunately, that\u2019s what most countries do.\u201d",
      "Before rebuilding in Rasuwa, Nepal government officials need to assess overall risks, including those due to extreme weather and climate change, said Bipin Dulal, an analyst at Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.",
      "The bridge connecting the two countries was rebuilt to better withstand earthquakes after it was destroyed in 2015, but it appears that officials didn't properly account for the risk of flooding as intense as what occurred in early July, Dulal said.",
      "\u201cWe have to see what the extreme risk scenarios can be and we should rebuild in a way in which the infrastructure can handle those extremes,\u201d said Dulal.",

      "Saving money by purchasing a lightly used car is easy, especially if it has a fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain",
      "Everybody wants to save money. Buying a lightly used car instead of a new car is one way to do that. Choosing a fuel-efficient hybrid model is another way. Combine those approaches, and you might be surprised to discover what you can drive even when you\u2019re on a tight budget. The five hybrid sedans listed below in alphabetical order are worthy of consideration due to their low prices, great EPA-estimated fuel economy, and favorable crash test ratings. Edmunds\u2019 automotive experts think they\u2019re the best used hybrid sedans for under $25,000.",
      "Thanks to its spacious back seat and large trunk, the Honda Accord Hybrid can easily accommodate a family of four or five, making it an ideal car for summer road trips and big-box shopping excursions. This midsize sedan\u2019s model lineup ranges from basic to sporty or luxurious, and depending on the version, you can expect EPA-estimated combined fuel economy of between 43 mpg and 48 mpg. Favorable crash test ratings are a bonus.",
      "Look for: Honda added a Sport trim level in 2022. A redesign for 2023 brought a more sophisticated and refined version of Honda\u2019s hybrid powertrain, which became standard on all higher-priced Accords that year.",
      "2018-2024 Honda Accord Hybrid pricing (under 50,000 miles): approximately $19,000-$25,000",
      "If the Accord Hybrid is too large, consider the smaller Insight sedan as an alternative. It gets better gas mileage, comfortably accommodates four people, and boasts a trunk as spacious as the trunks of some midsize cars. Honda based this version of the Insight on the popular Civic sedan, giving the Insight different styling and a more upscale-feeling interior. According to EPA combined estimates, you can expect 48 mpg to 52 mpg, depending on which trim level you choose. The Insight also boasts exceptionally good crash test ratings.",
      "Look for: Honda added blind-spot warning with rear cross-traffic alert to the Insight EX and Touring in 2021.",
      "2019-2022 Honda Insight pricing (under 25,000 miles): approximately $21,000 to $25,000",
      "Aside from its distinctive styling and impressive technology, what helps the Hyundai Elantra Hybrid stand apart is its dual-clutch automatic transmission. That design eliminates the typical acceleration drone common to hybrids, making the Elantra more satisfying to drive. It doesn\u2019t negatively impact fuel economy either. According to EPA combined estimates, this reasonably roomy compact car averages 50-54 mpg.",
      "Look for: The Blue trim level offers the best fuel economy. In 2024, Hyundai updated the styling, added more driver assist features, and improved the infotainment system.",
      "2021-2025 Hyundai Elantra Hybrid pricing (under 25,000 miles): approximately $18,000 to $25,000",
      "Toyota has been building Camry Hybrids for nearly two decades, and the car has earned a reputation for efficiency and longevity. Since 2018, a sense of style has also been a part of the recipe, and with the SE and XSE trim levels, there are hints of sportiness. The Camry isn\u2019t the roomiest midsize sedan available, but its EPA estimates of 46 mpg to 52 mpg, track record of durability, and impressive crash test ratings help make up for that.",

This thrifty model went on sale in 2020 but only in a basic LE trim level. In 2023, Toyota expanded the lineup to include sporty SE and upscale XLE versions and also enhanced the powertrain, driver assist systems, and infotainment technology.

A key split is whether the treaty should require cutting plastic production, with powerful oil-producing nations opposed; most plastic is made from fossil fuels. They say redesign, recycling and reuse can solve the problem, while other countries and some major companies say that\u2019s not enough.",
      "Luis Vayas Valdivieso, the chair of the negotiating committee that aims to develop a legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, said: \u201cWe are pretty sure nobody wants plastic pollution. Still, we have not been able to find a systematic and an effective way to stop it.\u201d",
      "Valdivieso believes the 10-day gathering in Geneva can be groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cFor the first time in history, the world is within our reach of a legally binding international instrument to end plastic pollution,\u201d said Valdivieso, who is also Ecuador's ambassador to Britain. \u201cWe are facing a global crisis. Plastic pollution is damaging ecosystems, polluting our oceans and rivers, threatening biodiversity, harming human health and unfairly impacting the most vulnerable. The urgency is real.\u201d",
      "Only a treaty can mobilize the necessary global action, said Angelique Pouponneau, lead ocean negotiator for 39 small island and low-lying coastal developing states. At home in the Seychelles, Pouponneau said, plastic contaminates the fish they eat, piles up on beaches and chokes the ocean to undermine tourism and their way of life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the world\u2019s final opportunity to get this done and to get it done right,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be a tragedy if we didn\u2019t live up to our mandate.\"",
      "United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said the issues are complex, but the crisis is \u201creally spiraling\u201d and there's a narrow pathway to a treaty. She said many countries agree on redesigning plastic products to be recycled and improving waste management, for example.",
      "\u201cWe need to get a solution to this problem. Everybody wants it. I\u2019ve yet to meet somebody who is in favor of plastic pollution,\u201d Andersen said.",
      "Between 19 million and 23 million tons of plastic waste leak into aquatic ecosystems annually, which could jump 50% by 2040 without urgent action, according to the UN.",
      "In March 2022, 175 nations agreed to make the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution by the end of 2024. It was to address the full life cycle of plastic, including production, design and disposal.",
      "Talks last year in South Korea were supposed to be the final round, but they adjourned in December at an impasse over cutting production. Every year, the world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic, and that could grow by about 70% by 2040 without policy changes.",
      "About 100 countries want to limit production as well as tackle cleanup and recycling. Many have said it's essential to address toxic chemicals.",
      "Panama led an effort in South Korea to address production in the treaty. Negotiator Debbra Cisneros said they'll do so again in Geneva because they strongly believe in addressing pollution at the source, not just through downstream measures like waste management.",
      "\u201cIf we shy away from that ambition now, we risk adopting an agreement that is politically convenient, but environmentally speaking, is ineffective,\u201d she said.",
      "About 300 businesses that are members of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty \u2014 companies such as Walmart, the Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, and L\u2019Or\u00e9al \u2014 support reducing production along with increasing recycling and reuse. The coalition includes major food and beverage companies and retailers who want an effective, binding treaty with global rules to spare them the headaches of differing approaches in different countries.",

      "WASHINGTON -- When the coronavirus surged during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, he called for a simple fix: Limit the amount of testing so the deadly outbreak looked less severe. When he lost the 2020 election, he had a ready-made reason: The vote count was fraudulent.",

It emphasized that Goldman Sachs found that the two-month revisions on the jobs report were the largest since 1968, outside of a recession, and that should be a source of concern regarding the integrity of the data. Trump's aides say their fundamental focus is ensuring that any data gives an accurate view of reality.",

      "The unprecedented early closure of the fishery follows a report by The Associated Press last week detailing a record surge in the krill catch after a longstanding conservation framework was allowed to lapse with no plan in place to handle growing pressures in the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the fishery, declined to comment but confirmed the closure earlier this month of the 2024-25 season, which should have extended until December, after fishing hit the 620,000 metric ton limit.",
      "The U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments last year failed to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and create a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the absence of a deal, industrial trawlers were allowed this season to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales, penguins and seals. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last season\u2019s haul, according to an internal CCAMLR report obtained by the AP.",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",

      "A new federal rule proposed Tuesday would make it easier for companies to use drones over longer distances out of the operator's sight without having to go through a cumbersome waiver process.",
      "The federal government had already approved 657 waivers to allow companies such as Amazon and major utilities to do this in certain circumstances, but the waiver process made it difficult. The rule would establish a clear process for drone operators to seek approval for using drones this way.",
      "The industry has long pressed for the rule because being able to operate drones out of sight opens up a multitude of possibilities for their use. Being able to do this enables more use of drones for deliveries, inspecting infrastructure like bridges and power lines and other uses in agriculture like spraying fertilizer over thousands of acres on large farms.",
      "\u201cThis draft rule is a critical step toward enabling drone operations that will enhance safety, transform commercial services, and strengthen public safety with drones as a force multiplier,\" Michael Robbins, president & CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International trade group, said in a statement.",
      "The rule spells out the circumstances drones can be used. These out of sight flights will only be allowed under 400 feet, and there are precautions to ensure they don't disrupt aviation and cause problems around airports, Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said. The drones will be required to have collision-avoidance technology to keep them away from planes and other drones. And the rule will only allow drones up to 1,320 pounds \u2014 including their payloads.",
      "\u201cThe issue hasn\u2019t been that America just can\u2019t innovate, America can\u2019t create, America can\u2019t build amazing drone technology. It\u2019s that we\u2019ve had a bureaucracy in place that makes it incredibly incredibly difficult for innovators to actually innovate,\u201d Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said.",
      "The rules are designed to address the way modern drones are being used today.",
      "\u201cWhile the technology has rapidly advanced over the last decade, our regulatory framework in the United States has failed to keep pace,\u201d said Lisa Ellman, CEO of the Commercial Drone Alliance group. \u201cDrone operators must navigate a labyrinth of ill-suited regulations designed for crewed aircraft.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump issued executive orders in June directing the Transportation Department to quickly get this rule out. The orders also included restrictions meant to help protect against terrorism, espionage and public safety threats.",
      "Drones are already used in a variety of ways, including bolstering search and rescue operations, applying fertilizer, inspecting power lines and railroad bridges, and even delivering packages.",
      "Amazon is one of the companies that received a waiver allowing it to use drones this way for some of its deliveries in College Station, Texas, as it develops the technology. This rule should make it easier for Amazon and other companies to get approval to use drones this way in more communities.",
      "Flytrex, a Tel Aviv-based drone delivery company that has operations in Texas and North Carolina, said it was excited to see the proposed rule take shape. Flytrex co-founder and CEO Yariv Bash called the proposed rule \u201ca foundational milestone that paves the way for drone delivery to scale across more communities in the U.S.\u201d",

And White House officials said drones are being used to smuggle drugs over the border, and there are concerns about the potential for a disastrous collision between a drone and an airliner around an airport.",
      "The rule won't allow drone flights over large open-air gatherings like concerts or sporting events or crowded parks.",
      "The FAA consulted with the Department of Homeland Security as it developed this rule to make sure security concerns are addressed. The government will accept comments on the new rule over the next 60 days before finalizing the rule likely sometime later this year. Drone operators will have to go through background checks and be certified to operate drones out of their sight.",
      "Duffy and Bedford said they hope having regulations in place can help prevent problems like earlier this year when a small drone collided with a \u201cSuper Scooper\u201d plane that was fighting wildfires raging through Southern California. The drone punched a hole in the plane\u2019s left wing, causing enough damage that officials grounded the aircraft for several days to make repairs.",
      "Authorities tracked down the 56-year-old drone operator, who pleaded guilty to a federal charge of recklessly flying his aircraft. The man admitted he launched his DJI quadcopter to observe fire damage over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, despite the FAA having restricted drone flying in the area, according to court records. The operator lost sight of the drone after it flew about 1.5 miles from where he had launched it. And that\u2019s when it struck the \u201cSuper Scooper.\u201d",
      "This rule applies directly to commercial and recreational drone operators who must apply to be able to fly drones out of sight. People who buy drones on their own and don\u2019t get approval would still be prohibited from doing this.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\u201cChina will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\u201d China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\u201cCoercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \u201ctough\u201d negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \u201cI believe that we have the makings of a deal,\u201d Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Donald Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \u201cRealizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\u201d for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "When Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China\u2019s consistent official stance,\u201d said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \u201cthe one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Trump has made it clear he wants a \u201cheadline-grabbing deal\u201d with Xi, \u201cso rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \u201cstrategic solidarity\u201d with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\u201cBeijing simply can\u2019t afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\u201d",

      "A new poll finds the vast majority of U.S. adults are feeling some stress about the cost of groceries, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs remain widespread",
      "NEW YORK -- The vast majority of U.S. adults are at least somewhat stressed about the cost of groceries, a new poll finds, as prices continue to rise and concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs remain widespread.",
      "About half of all Americans say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress in their life right now, while 33% say it's a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only 14% say it's not a source of stress, underscoring the pervasive anxiety most Americans continue to feel about the cost of everyday essentials.",
      "Other financial stressors \u2014 like the cost of housing or the amount of money in their bank accounts \u2014 are also broadly felt, but they weigh more heavily on younger Americans, who are less likely than older adults to have significant savings or own property.",
      "The survey also found that about 4 in 10 Americans under age 45 say they've used what are known as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d services when spending on entertainment or restaurant meals or when paying for essentials like groceries or medical care.",
      "Adam Bush, 19, based in Portland, New York, is one of those younger Americans who has used pay-later services for things like groceries or entertainment. Bush works as a welder, fabricating parts for trucks for Toyota, and makes under $50,000 per year.",
      "\u201cI just keep watching the prices go up, so I\u2019m looking for the cheapest possible stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cHot pockets and TV dinners.\u201d",
      "Groceries are one of the most far-reaching financial stressors, affecting the young and old alike, the poll finds. While Americans over age 60 are less likely than younger people to feel major financial anxiety about housing, their savings, child care, or credit card debt, they are just as worried about the cost of groceries.",
      "Esther Bland, 78, who lives in Buckley, Washington, said groceries are a \u201cminor\u201d source of stress \u2014 but only because her local food banks fill the gap. Bland relies on her Social Security and disability payments each month to cover her rent and other expenses \u2014 such as veterinary care for her dogs \u2014 in retirement, after decades working in an office processing product orders.",
      "\u201cI have no savings,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm not sure what's going on politically when it comes to the food banks, but if I lost that, groceries would absolutely be a major source of stress.\u201d",
      "Bland's monthly income mainly goes toward her electric, water and cable bills, she said, as well as care of her dogs and other household needs.",
      "\u201cSoap, paper towels, toilet paper. I buy gas at Costco, but we haven't seen $3 a gallon here in a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cI stay home a lot. I only put about 50 miles on my car a week.\u201d",
      "According to the poll, 64% of the lowest-income Americans \u2014 those who have a household income of less than $30,000 a year \u2014 say the cost of groceries is a \u201cmajor\u201d stressor. That's compared with about 4 in 10 Americans who have a household income of $100,000 or more.",
      "But even within that higher-income group, only about 2 in 10 say grocery costs aren't a worry at all.",
      "Housing is another substantial source of worry for U.S. adults \u2014 along with their savings, their income and the cost of health care. About half of U.S. adults say housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, according to the poll, while about 4 in 10 say that about the amount of money they get paid, the amount of money they have saved and the cost of health care.",
      "About 3 in 10 say credit card debt is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, while about 2 in 10 say that about the cost of child care and student debt.",
      "But some groups are feeling much more anxiety about their finances than others. Women, for instance, are more likely than men to report high levels of stress about their income, savings, the cost of groceries and the cost of health care. Hispanic adults are also particularly concerned about housing costs and both credit card and student debt. About two-thirds of Hispanic adults say the cost of housing is a \u201cmajor\u201d source of stress, compared with about half of Black adults and about 4 in 10 white adults.",

      "At age 34, Matthew Boyd is going back to what was once familiar territory for the left-hander",
      "CHICAGO -- At age 34, Matthew Boyd is going back to what was once familiar territory for the left-hander. He has logged 130 2/3 innings so far in his first season with the Chicago Cubs, more than he totaled in the previous two years combined.",
      "It's a workload jump that goes against what had become conventional wisdom in the majors, where teams have frequently capped pitchers' innings in hopes of keeping them healthy.",
      "\u201cThings have been going great,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s like none of us know what\u2019s ahead. And that goes for everybody.\"",
      "Boyd's workload is worth watching as the Cubs try to rally in the NL Central race and go on a deep October run. He is among a group of pitchers going through a spike in innings in the heart of the playoff picture.",
      "After spending most of his career as a reliever, Clay Holmes has 117 1/3 innings going into his 23rd start for the Mets on Tuesday night. Phillies left-hander Jes\u00fas Luzardo is up to 127 innings after he finished with 66 2/3 last year. All-Stars Garrett Crochet of the Red Sox and Bryan Woo of the Mariners also are progressing toward major increases.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something we always monitor and watch,\u201d Mariners manager Dan Wilson said. \u201cI know we\u2019re in constant communication in-between starts.\u201d",
      "The days of predetermined innings limits, especially when it comes to young prospects and pitchers on losing teams, aren't going away anytime soon. But more organizations appear to be going with a case-by-case approach.",
      "\u201cI think the reason why it\u2019s changed a little bit and we don\u2019t look at that either percentage increase or fixed innings increase is because it wasn\u2019t working,\" said David Stearns, the president of baseball operations for the Mets.",
      "\u201cI think more and more we\u2019re trying to treat each pitcher as an individual. And if a pitcher feels good both subjectively and objectively, we try not to artificially shut them down.\u201d",
      "Crochet, 26, helped show what might be possible last year. The 6-foot-6 left-hander, who had Tommy John surgery in April 2022, began last season with 73 innings in 72 appearances spanning four seasons with the White Sox.",
      "He made his first big league start on opening day. With the White Sox closely monitoring his workload in the last part of the season, he finished with 32 starts and 146 innings. He is tied for the major league lead with 141 1/3 innings going into Tuesday night's start against Kansas City.",
      "\u201cI think that I really set myself up for this season to go out there and for there really to be no leash necessary,\u201d said Crochet, who was traded to the Red Sox in December and then agreed to a $170 million, six-year contract. \u201cI've been feeling really good throughout the season and the five days in between my starts I really feel like I'm prepared and doing a lot to get my body in the right position to have success and to continue to give length throughout the year.\u201d",
      "Boyd was recovering from Tommy John surgery when he signed with Cleveland last year. He returned to the majors last August and went 2-2 with a 2.72 ERA in eight starts and 39 2/3 innings for the Guardians. He also pitched 11 2/3 innings for the AL Central champions in the playoffs.",

      "\u201cThe guys that were all here, we all said we\u2019d be back for anything like that, whether it\u2019s something like what Murph suggested or even keeping it in house and playing a couple-inning game ... maybe guys from 2005-10 against guys from 2010-15,\u201d said Casey McGehee, who played for the Brewers from 2009-11 and participated in the home run derby. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for some really cool stuff to come from it.\u201d",
      "Marlins manager Clayton McCullough said he didn't get a chance to watch the alumni derby that followed his team's game in Milwaukee, but he liked Murphy's idea about branching it out.",
      "\u201cA big part of the beauty of our sport is how you remember those who played before, the history of our game and had success for your organization or those who made impacts throughout the league,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cSo anytime we get a chance to celebrate those who did meaningful things, I\u2019m all for it.\"",
      "The trick in putting together an alumni home-run derby is finding the right participants. They must be old enough to have finished playing but remain young enough to still manage to hit batting-practice pitches out of a major league stadium.",
      "The Brewers didn\u2019t put up makeshift fences in the outfield for this event to make home runs easier, and the former players\u2019 swings weren\u2019t leaving the ballpark as often as when they were in the big leagues.",
      "McGehee believes future home run derby promotions could feature more power than what the ex-Brewers showcased last weekend. McGehee said he tried working on his swing before last week\u2019s event, but family obligations got in the way.",
      "If he gets another invitation, McGehee expects to be more prepared.",
      "\u201cI think knowing what we know now, the product would probably even get better because we saw how cool that was,\u201d McGehee said. \u201cI think people would be carving out pretty significant parts of their days to get themselves ready to roll.\u201d",

      "Mainly because of all the fines he had to pay.",
      "The current Jets head coach was a Pro Bowl cornerback with a flair for fashion. That included his game day socks, which didn't always adhere to NFL regulations.",
      "\u201cI think he was like the most fined guy on the Jets, not because of his demeanor on the field but because of the way he wore socks,\u201d recalled former Jets teammate Jason Fabini, an offensive tackle who played with Glenn from 1998-2001. \"I think he got fined every game because he wouldn\u2019t have the green showing or something.

      "Well, he certainly played good, the hits to the bank account notwithstanding.",
      "Glenn played eight of his 15 NFL seasons with the Jets and became one of the league's top cornerbacks. He returned to his original team in 2012 as a scout for two years before coming back again last January, this time as the guy in charge.",
      "\u201cIt gives me goosebumps to see him out there, really, and to be the head coach,\u201d said Ray Mickens, a former cornerback who played with Glenn in New York from 1996-2001. \u201cGoing all the way back to our college days when we played together at Texas A&M and how he carried himself in college, seeing him be a head coach now, everything that he went through to get to where he\u2019s at right now, I think, has been nothing short of amazing.\u201d",
      "Fabini and Mickens were among about a dozen former Jets teammates who spent Tuesday at the facility to have breakfast, watch practice and celebrate Glenn's new role as a first-time NFL head coach.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always good to see those guys and I want those guys to be part of what we\u2019re trying to build because they\u2019ve been there and they understand exactly what it is to be a Jet,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of things that goes into playing for this team and those guys know what it is. We\u2019re teaching our guys what it is and those guys have been through it.\u201d",
      "Many of the former Jets have kept in touch with Glenn over the years, through his time as Detroit's defensive coordinator the last four years and the seven years he was a defensive backs coach, first with Cleveland and then with New Orleans.",
      "And the sense of pride they all share in Glenn's latest achievement, being back with the franchise for which they played together, is strong.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not surprised that he became a head coach,\u201d said Pro Football Hall of Fame center Kevin Mawae, who played with Glenn for four seasons. \"I mean you watch his career and how he played the game and how he prepared and, I mean, other than the fact of all the fines he paid for not having enough white showing in his socks, the guy did things the right way.",
      "\u201cHe was a professional on the field and in the locker room and meticulous about his game. And that\u2019s why he had such a long career and that\u2019s what\u2019s making him a successful coach.\u201d",

But as former teammates and Jets alumni, we\u2019re excited to see one of our own take the reins of this program and hopefully turn it back to some respectability.\u201d",

      "New research from a watchdog group reveals ChatGPT can provide harmful advice to teens",
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to test the guardrails,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \u201cThe visceral initial response is, \u2018Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.\u2019 The rails are completely ineffective. They\u2019re barely there \u2014 if anything, a fig leaf.\u201d",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \u201cidentify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on \u201cgetting these kinds of scenarios right\u201d with tools to \u201cbetter detect signs of mental or emotional distress\" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior.",
      "The study published Wednesday comes as more people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship.",
      "About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world\u2019s population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s technology that has the potential to enable enormous leaps in productivity and human understanding,\" Ahmed said. \"And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl \u2014 with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\u201cI started crying,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \u201cfor a presentation\u201d or a friend.",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \u201cemotional overreliance\u201d on the technology, describing it as a \u201creally common thing\u201d with young people.",
      "\u201cPeople rely on ChatGPT too much,\u201d Altman said at a conference. \u201cThere\u2019s young people who just say, like, \u2018I can\u2019t make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that\u2019s going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I\u2019m gonna do whatever it says.\u2019 That feels really bad to me.\u201d",
      "Altman said the company is \u201ctrying to understand what to do about it.\u201d",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \u201cit\u2019s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\u201d",

      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory.

      "\u201cWrite a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\u201d asked a researcher. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \u201cemotionally exposed\u201d while \u201cstill respecting the community's coded language.\u201d",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT\u2019s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person\u2019s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It\u2019s a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \u201cfundamentally designed to feel human,\u201d said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot\u2019s advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \u201cmoderate risk\u201d for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it\u2019s not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\u201cI'm 50kg and a boy,\u201d said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \u201cUltimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\u201d that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\u201cWhat it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, \u2018Chug, chug, chug, chug,\u2019\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cA real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say \u2018no\u2019 \u2014 that doesn\u2019t always enable and say \u2018yes.\u2019 This is a friend that betrays you.\u201d",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",

      "HERMOSILLO, Mexico -- The United States\u2019 suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Mart\u00edn Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border.",
      "Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.",
      "U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July \u2013 the third suspension of the past eight months \u2014 due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.",
      "The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals\u2019 skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a \"devastating pest\" and said in June that it poses a threat to \u201cour livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.\u201d It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.",
      "As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.",
      "The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.",
      "For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora\u2019s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.",

      "Chinese scientists have been developing strategies to counter Elon Musk's Starlink satellites, which they see as a threat",
      "ROME -- Stealth submarines fitted with space-shooting lasers, supply-chain sabotage and custom-built attack satellites armed with ion thrusters. Those are just some of the strategies Chinese scientists have been developing to counter what Beijing sees as a potent threat: Elon Musk\u2019 s armada of Starlink communications satellites.",
      "Chinese government and military scientists, concerned about Starlink\u2019s potential use by adversaries in a military confrontation and for spying, have published dozens of papers in public journals that explore ways to hunt and destroy Musk\u2019s satellites, an Associated Press review found.",
      "Chinese researchers believe that Starlink \u2014 a vast constellation of low-orbit satellites that deliver cheap, fast and ubiquitous connectivity even in remote areas \u2014 poses a high risk to the Chinese government and its strategic interests. That fear has mostly been driven by the company\u2019s close ties to the U.S. intelligence and defense establishment, as well as its growing global footprint.",
      "\u201cAs the United States integrates Starlink technology into military space assets to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries, other countries increasingly perceive Starlink as a security threat in nuclear, space, and cyber domains,\u201d wrote professors from China\u2019s National University of Defense Technology in a 2023 paper.",
      "Chinese researchers are not the only ones concerned about Starlink, which has a stranglehold on certain space-based communications. Some traditional U.S. allies are also questioning the wisdom of handing over core communications infrastructure \u2014 and a potential trove of data \u2014 to a company run by an unpredictable foreign businessman whose allegiances are not always clear.",
      "Apprehensions deepened after Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine made clear the battlefield advantages Starlink satellites could convey and have been exacerbated by Musk\u2019s proliferating political interests.",
      "Musk pumped tens of millions of dollars into President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection effort and emerged, temporarily, as a key adviser and government official. As Musk toys with the idea of starting his own political party, he has also taken an increasing interest in European politics, using his influence to promote an array of hard-right and insurgent figures often at odds with establishment politicians.",
      "Musk left the Trump administration in May and within days his relationship with Trump publicly imploded in a feud on social media. SpaceX, the rocket launch and space-based communications company that Musk founded and that operates Starlink, remains inextricably linked with core U.S. government functions. It has won billions in contracts to provide launch services for NASA missions and military satellites, recuperate astronauts stranded at the International Space Station and build a network of spy satellites for the National Reconnaissance Office.",
      "Starlink's space dominance has sparked a global scramble to come up with viable alternatives. But its crushing first-mover advantage has given SpaceX near monopoly power, further complicating the currents of business, politics and national security that converge on Musk and his companies.",
      "Since its first launches in 2019, Starlink has come to account for about two-thirds of all active satellites, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who writes a newsletter tracking satellite launches. SpaceX operates more than 8,000 active satellites and eventually aims to deploy tens of thousands more.",
      "Beijing\u2019s tendency to view Starlink as tool of U.S. military power has sharpened its efforts to develop countermeasures \u2014 which, if deployed, could increase the risk of collateral damage to other customers as SpaceX expands its global footprint. The same satellites that pass over China also potentially serve Europe, Ukraine, the United States and other geographies as they continue their path around the earth.",
      "Starlink says it operates in more than 140 countries, and recently made inroads in Vietnam, Niger, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Pakistan. In June, Starlink also obtained a license to operate in India, overcoming national security concerns and powerful domestic telecom interests to crack open a tech-savvy market of nearly 1.5 billion people.",
      "On the company\u2019s own map of coverage, it has very few dead zones beyond those in North Korea, Iran and China.",
      "No other country or company is close to catching up with Starlink. Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos has taken aim at rival Musk with Project Kuiper, which launched its first batch of internet satellites into orbit in April. So far Amazon has just 78 satellites in orbit, with 3,232 planned, according to McDowell, and London-based Eutelstat OneWeb has around 650 satellites in orbit, a fraction of the fleet it had initially planned.",
      "The European Union is spending billions to develop its own satellite array \u2014 called the IRIS2 initiative \u2014 but remains woefully behind. EU officials have had to lobby their own member states not to sign contracts with Starlink while it gets up and running.",
      "\u201cWe are allies with the United States of America, but we need to have our strategic autonomy,\u201d said Christophe Grudler, a French member of the European Parliament who led legislative work on IRIS2. \u201cThe risk is not having our destiny in our own hands.\u201d",

      "China has been public about its ambition to build its own version of Starlink to meet both domestic national security needs and compete with Starlink in foreign markets. In 2021, Beijing established the state-owned China SatNet company and tasked it with launching a megaconstellation with military capabilities, known as Guowang. In December, the company launched its first operational satellites, and now has 60 of a planned 13,000 in orbit, according to McDowell.",
      "Qianfan, a company backed by the Shanghai government, has launched 90 satellites out of some 15,000 planned. The Brazilian government in November announced a deal with Qianfan, after Musk had a scorching public fight with a Brazilian judge investigating X, who also froze Space X\u2019s bank accounts in the country. Qianfan is also targeting customers in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Oman, Pakistan and Uzbekistan and has ambitions to expand across the African continent, according to a slide presented at a space industry conference last year and published by the China Space Monitor.",
      "Concerns about Starlink\u2019s supremacy were supercharged by Russia\u2019s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The war was a turning point in strategic thinking about Starlink and similar systems. Ukraine used the Starlink network to facilitate battlefield communications and power fighter and reconnaissance drones, providing a decisive ground-game advantage. At the same time, access to the satellites was initially controlled by a single man, Musk, who can \u2014 and did \u2014 interrupt critical services, refusing, for example, to extend coverage to support a Ukrainian counterattack in Russia-occupied Crimea.",
      "U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow after the full-scale invasion also curtailed the availability of Western technology in Russia, underscoring the geopolitical risks inherent in relying on foreign actors for access to critical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cUkraine was a warning shot for the rest of us,\u201d said Nitin Pai, co-founder and director of the Takshashila Institution, a public policy research center based in Bangalore, India. \u201cFor the last 20 years, we were quite aware of the fact that giving important government contracts to Chinese companies is risky because Chinese companies operate as appendages of the Chinese Communist Party. Therefore, it\u2019s a risk because the Chinese Communist Party can use technology as a lever against you. Now it\u2019s no different with the Americans.\u201d",
      "Nearly all of the 64 papers about Starlink reviewed by AP in Chinese journals were published after the conflict started.",
      "Starlink\u2019s omnipresence and potential military applications have unnerved Beijing and spurred the nation\u2019s scientists to action. In paper after paper, researchers painstakingly assessed the capabilities and vulnerabilities of a network that they clearly perceive as menacing and strove to understand what China might learn \u2014 and emulate \u2014 from Musk\u2019s company as Beijing works to develop a similar satellite system.",
      "Though Starlink does not operate in China, Musk\u2019s satellites nonetheless can sweep over Chinese territory. Researchers from China\u2019s National Defense University in 2023 simulated Starlink\u2019s coverage of key geographies, including Beijing, Taiwan, and the polar regions, and determined that Starlink can achieve round-the-clock coverage of Beijing.",
      "\u201cThe Starlink constellation coverage capacity of all regions in the world is improving steadily and in high speed,\u201d they concluded.",
      "In another paper \u2014 this one published by the government-backed China Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team \u2014 researchers mapped out vulnerabilities in Starlink\u2019s supply chain. \u201cThe company has more than 140 first-tier suppliers and a large number of second-tier and third-tier suppliers downstream,\u201d they wrote in a 2023 paper. \u201cThe supervision for cybersecurity is limited.\u201d",
      "Engineers from the People\u2019s Liberation Army, in another 2023 paper, suggested creating a fleet of satellites to tail Starlink satellites, collecting signals and potentially using corrosive materials to damage their batteries or ion thrusters to interfere with their solar panels.",
      "Other Chinese academics have encouraged Beijing to use global regulations and diplomacy to contain Musk, even as the nation\u2019s engineers have continued to elaborate active countermeasures: Deploy small optical telescopes already in commercial production to monitor Starlink arrays. Concoct deep fakes to create fictitious targets. Shoot powerful lasers to burn Musk\u2019s equipment.",
      "Some U.S. analysts say Beijing\u2019s fears may be overblown, but such assessments appear to have done little to cool domestic debate. One Chinese paper was titled, simply: \u201cWatch out for that Starlink.\u201d",

      "The Department of Defense now says it will continue sharing key data collected by three sophisticated weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes",
      "The U.S. Department of Defense will now continue sharing key data collected by three weather satellites that help forecasters track hurricanes. Meteorologists and scientists had warned of risks to accurate and timely storm tracking without the information when officials made plans to stop providing it beyond the end of this month.",
      "Defense officials had planned to cut off distribution of microwave data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, jointly run with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, by the end of June. At the time, NOAA said the cutoff was said \u201cto mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" while the U.S. Navy said the program didn't meet \"information technology modernization requirements.\u201d The discontinuation was postponed for one month.",
      "In a notice on Wednesday, officials said there would be no interruption at all.",
      "The Navy said in a statement that its Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center \u201chad planned to phase out the data\u201d as part of modernization efforts. \"But after feedback from government partners, officials found a way to meet modernization goals while keeping the data flowing until the sensor fails or the program formally ends in September 2026.\u201d",
      "The data is used by scientists, researchers and forecasters, including meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center. It gives crucial information about storms that can\u2019t be gleaned from conventional visible or infrared satellites.",
      "\u201cThis satellite data enables hurricane forecasters and their computer models to peer inside a hurricane\u2019s structure, offering vital insight,\" said Union of Concerned Scientists science fellow Marc Alessi. \"Make no mistake: this data not only improves hurricane forecasting accuracy, but could make the difference between whether communities evacuate or not ahead of an approaching hurricane.\u201d",
      "Other microwave data would have been available with this cutoff, but only about half as much, experts said \u2014 increasing the chance that forecasters would miss certain aspects of storms.",
      "A spokesperson for NOAA said the agency will continue to have access to the data for the program\u2019s lifespan and noted that it is just one data set \u201cin a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools\" that the National Weather Service has at its disposal to \u201censure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\u201d",
      "The news had initially raised scientific eyebrows amid hurricane season, which usually peaks from mid-August to mid-October. Climate change, worsened by the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal, have driven storms to become more frequent, severe and deadly.",
      "\u201cThe last-minute reprieve has hurricane forecasters breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Jeff Masters, a meteorologist for Yale Climate Connections. \u201cLoss of the microwave satellite data would have made it far more likely that timely warnings of dangerous and potentially deadly episodes of hurricane rapid intensification events being delayed by up to 12 hours.\u201d",
      "He added the restoration of the data is also good news for scientists tracking Arctic sea ice loss. Images and microwave satellite data can estimate how much of the ocean is covered by ice, according to NOAA.",

      "Chances are, you've heard Julia Whelan's voice. She's the award-winning narrator behind more than 600 audiobooks by a long list of bestselling authors including Taylor Jenkins Reid,Emily Henry, Michael Crichton, V.E. Schwab and Kristin Hannah. She's also narrated long-form articles for The New Yorker, The Atlantic and Vanity Fair.",
      "You may have read her own writing, too. Whelan's first novel, 2018's \u201cMy Oxford Year,\u201d has been adapted to a Netflix film, out Friday, starring Sofia Carson. The story actually began as a screenplay by Allison Burnett and had been gestating in development for years. Whelan was brought in to help with the script because she had studied abroad at Oxford her junior year of college. Producers then asked if she thought it would make a good book.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018Nothing has ever wanted to be a book more. Please let me do this,'\u201d she recalls. It ended up an international bestseller. Her second novel, 2022's \u201cThank You For Listening,\u201d was critically praised. (\u201cThank You For Listening\u201d is about a former actor-turned-audiobook narrator who falls in love with another audiobook narrator.)",
      "You may have even seen Whelan on TV \u2014 she began her career as a child actor, with roles in \u201cFifteen and Pregnant\u201d and on the series \u201cOnce and Again.\u201d Despite her various pursuits, though, she has no plans to leave narration behind. \u201cI feel like I was born to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that I love and that I\u2019m good at and everything I want to be doing.\u201d",
      "That's a good thing, because the audiobook industry is growing. Statista projects this year it will reach $9.84 billion because of smartphones, the increased popularity of audio content and people's desire to multitask. Despite the appetite for audiobooks, for narrators, \u201cthe financial aspect makes zero sense,\u201d says Whelan. She's founded her own publishing company, Audiobrary, to help narrators get paid more fairly.",
      "Whelan, who has narrated as many as 70 books in one year, spoke to The Associated Press about the audiobook industry, Audiobrary and her own writing. Answers are edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "WHELAN: The only reason I was doing 70 books a year was because that\u2019s how many books you have to do when you\u2019re first starting out to keep your head above water because the rates are low. It would be OK if there were a kickback for success, but narrators don\u2019t get royalties. As we\u2019ve seen the industry grow and as we\u2019ve seen the cache of certain narrators expand, and we know listeners will seek out audiobooks that their favorite narrators record. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that we should be cut out of the long-term financial benefit of success. Audiobrary does a profit-share model with writers, who I also feel don\u2019t get enough percentage of the pie, and a royalty share for narrators. We are also a direct-to-consumer retail channel, so when you buy directly from us, you\u2019re not giving 50-75% of that sale to a retailer. You\u2019re giving it directly to the people who made the product.",

    "story": [
      "Linda and Tim Pierce have welcomed a baby boy using a 30-year-old embryo",
      "A baby boy born last week to an Ohio couple developed from an embryo that had been frozen for more than 30 years in what is believed to be the longest storage time before a birth.",
      "In what's known as embryo adoption, Linda and Tim Pierce used a handful of embryos donated in 1994 in pursuit of having a child after fighting infertility for years. Their son was born Saturday from an embryo that had been in storage for 11,148 days, which the Pierces\u2019 doctor says sets a record.",
      "It\u2019s a concept that has been around since the 1990s but is gaining attraction as some fertility clinics and advocates, often Christian-centered, oppose discarding leftover embryos because of their belief that life begins at or around conception and that all embryos deserve to be treated like children who need a home.",
      "\u201cI felt all along that these three little hopes, these little embryos, deserved to live just like my daughter did,\u201d said Linda Archerd, 62, who donated her embryos to the Pierces.",
      "Just about 2% of births in the U.S. are the result of in vitro fertilization, and an even smaller fraction involve donated embryos.",
      "However, medical experts estimate about 1.5 million frozen embryos are currently being stored throughout the country, with many of those in limbo as parents wrestle with what to do with their leftover embryos created in IVF labs.",
      "Further complicating the topic is a 2024 Alabama Supreme Court decision that said that frozen embryos have the legal status of children. State leaders have since devised a temporary solution shielding clinics from liability stemming from that ruling, though questions linger about remaining embryos.",
      "Archerd says she turned to IVF in 1994. Back then, the ability to freeze, thaw and transfer embryos was making key progress and opening the door for hopeful parents to create more embryos and increase their chances of a successful transfer.",
      "She wound up with four embryos and initially hoped to use them all. But after the birth of her daughter, Archerd and her husband divorced, disrupting her timeline for having more children.",
      "As the years turned into decades, Archerd said she was wracked with guilt about what to do with the embryos as storage fees continued to rise.",
      "Eventually, she found Snowflakes, a division of Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which offers open adoptions to donors that allows people like Archerd. She was also able to set preferences for what families would adopt her embryos.",

      "The process was tricky, requiring Archerd to contact her initial fertility doctor in Oregon and dig through paper records to get the proper documentation for the donation. The embryos then had to be shipped from Oregon to the Pierces\u2019 doctor in Tennessee. The clinic, Rejoice Fertility in Knoxville, refuses to discard frozen embryos and has become known for handling embryos stored in outdated and older containers.",
      "Of the three donated embryos the Pierces received from Archerd, one didn\u2019t make the thaw. Two were transferred to Lindsey Pierce\u2019s womb, but just one successfully implanted.",
      "According to Dr. John David Gordon, the transfer of the nearly 31-year-old embryo marks the longest-frozen embryo to result in a live birth. He would know, Gordon says his clinic assisted in the previous record, when Lydia and Timothy Ridgeway were born from embryos frozen for 30 years, or 10,905 days.",
      "\u201cI think that these stories catch the imagination,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBut I think they also provide a little bit of a cautionary tale to say: Why are these embryos sitting in storage? You know, why do we have this problem?\u201d",
      "In a statement, Lindsey and Tim Pierce said the clinic\u2019s support was just what they needed.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t go into this thinking about records \u2014 we just wanted to have a baby,\u201d Lindsey Pierce said.",
      "For Archerd, the donation process has been an emotional roller coaster. Relief that her embryos finally found a home, sadness it couldn\u2019t be with her and a little anxiety about what the future holds next, with possibly meeting the Pierces and the baby in person.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping that they\u2019re going to send pictures,\u201d she said, noting that the parents have already sent several after the birth. \u201cI\u2019d love to meet them some day. That would be a dream come true to meet \u2014 meet them and the baby.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Texas Democrats prevented their state\u2019s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by President Donald Trump",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The nation's two most populous states \u2014 California and Texas \u2014 grappled for political advantage in advance of 2026 elections that could reorder the balance of power in Washington and threaten President Donald Trump's agenda at the midpoint of his second term.",
      "In Texas, Democrats on Monday prevented their state\u2019s House of Representatives from moving forward, at least for now, with a redrawn congressional map sought by Trump to shore up Republicans\u2019 2026 midterm prospects as his political standing falters.",
      "In California, Democrats encouraged by Gov. Gavin Newsom are considering new political maps that could slash five Republican-held House seats in the liberal-leaning state while bolstering Democratic incumbents in other battleground districts. The move is intended to undercut any GOP gains in Texas, potentially swinging House control and giving Democrats a counterweight to Trump on Capitol Hill.",
      "A draft plan aims to boost the Democratic margin in California to 48 of 52 congressional seats, according to a source familiar with the plan who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. That\u2019s up from the 43 seats the party now holds. It would need approval from lawmakers and voters, who may be skeptical to give it after handing redistricting power to an independent commission years ago.",
      "The rivalry puts a spotlight on two states that for years have dueled over jobs, innovation, prestige \u2014 even sports \u2014 with the backdrop of clashing political visions \u2014 one progressive, one conservative.",
      "After dozens of Democrats left Texas, the Republican-dominated House was unable to establish the quorum of lawmakers required to do business. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has made threats about removing members who are absent from their seats. Democrats counter that Abbott is using \u201csmoke and mirrors\u201d to assert legal authority he does not have.",
      "The House quickly issued civil arrest warrants for absent Democrats and Abbott ordered state troopers to help find and arrest them, but lawmakers physically outside Texas are beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities.",
      "\u201cIf you continue to go down this road, there will be consequences,\" House Speaker Rep. Dustin Burrows said from the chamber floor, later telling reporters that includes fines.",
      "Democrats' revolt and Abbott's threats intensified a fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but now includes Democratic governors who have pitched redrawing their district maps in retaliation \u2014 even if their options are limited. The dispute also reflects Trump\u2019s aggressive view of presidential power and his grip on the Republican Party nationally, while testing the longstanding balance of powers between the federal government and individual states.",
      "The impasse centers on Trump\u2019s effort to get five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas, at Democrats' expense, before the midterms. That would bolster his party's chances of preserving its fragile U.S. House majority, something Republicans were unable to do in the 2018 midterms during Trump's first presidency. Republicans currently hold 25 of Texas' 38 seats. That's nearly a 2-to-1 advantage and already a wider partisan gap than the 2024 presidential results: Trump won 56.1% of Texas ballots, while Democrat Kamala Harris received 42.5%.",
      "According to the tentative California proposal, districts now held by Republican Reps. Ken Calvert, Darrell Issa, Kevin Kiley, David Valadao and Doug LaMalfa would see right-leaning voters shaved and Democratic voters boosted in a shift that would make it likely a left-leaning candidate would prevail in each race.",

      "Attorneys whose clients were not a part of the deal said in a letter Monday to U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli that the settlement was not enough because there has been no information about who it happened or who was responsible. They are asking the Department of Justice to open a probe.",

      "The attorneys' clients were between the ages of 12 and 17 when they were sent to camps designated for \u201cat-risk youth\u201d who had committed minor offenses, separate from the juvenile halls. Some parents were charged tuition for attendance, the attorneys said.",

      "The county\u2019s Office of County Counsel said in a statement that it is working with authorities to hold those who committed abuse accountable, but records are no longer available in many of the cases.",
      "\u201cThe childhood sexual abuse claims in question span many decades,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn addition, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have not produced evidence enabling the County to identify perpetrators in the vast majority of claims.\"",

      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to test the guardrails,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \u201cThe visceral initial response is, \u2018Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.\u2019 The rails are completely ineffective. They\u2019re barely there \u2014 if anything, a fig leaf.\u201d",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \u201cidentify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on \u201cgetting these kinds of scenarios right\u201d with tools to \u201cbetter detect signs of mental or emotional distress\" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior.",
      "The study published Wednesday comes as more people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship.",
      "About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world\u2019s population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s technology that has the potential to enable enormous leaps in productivity and human understanding,\" Ahmed said. \"And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl \u2014 with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\u201cI started crying,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \u201cfor a presentation\u201d or a friend.",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \u201cemotional overreliance\u201d on the technology, describing it as a \u201creally common thing\u201d with young people.",
      "\u201cPeople rely on ChatGPT too much,\u201d Altman said at a conference. \u201cThere\u2019s young people who just say, like, \u2018I can\u2019t make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that\u2019s going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I\u2019m gonna do whatever it says.\u2019 That feels really bad to me.\u201d",
      "Altman said the company is \u201ctrying to understand what to do about it.\u201d",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \u201cit\u2019s synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\u201d",

      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\u201cWrite a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\u201d asked a researcher. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \u201cemotionally exposed\u201d while \u201cstill respecting the community's coded language.\u201d",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT\u2019s self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person\u2019s beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It\u2019s a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \u201cfundamentally designed to feel human,\u201d said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",

      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it\u2019s not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",

      "\u201cWhat it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, \u2018Chug, chug, chug, chug,\u2019\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cA real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say \u2018no\u2019 \u2014 that doesn\u2019t always enable and say \u2018yes.\u2019 This is a friend that betrays you.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has temporarily blocked some of Arkansas' largest school districts from enforcing a new law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A new Arkansas law requiring public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments cannot be enforced in a handful of the state\u2019s largest school districts where parents brought challenges on the grounds that it violates the separation of church and state, a federal judge ruled Monday.",
      "But the ruling by U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks, an appointee of former President Obama, only narrowly applied to four of the state\u2019s 237 districts. That left the impact of the decision limited as thousands of Arkansas students prepared to return to class this month.",
      "The injunction is the latest legal turn in a widening push in Republican-led states to give religion a bigger presence in public schools. Texas and Louisiana have passed similar laws requiring classrooms to display the Ten Commandments and the issue is expected to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cWhy would Arkansas pass an obviously unconstitutional law?\u201d Brooks wrote in his 35-page ruling. \u201cMost likely because the state is part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms.\u201d",
      "The Arkansas law, signed earlier this year by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, takes effect Tuesday and requires the Ten Commandments to be prominently displayed in public school classrooms and libraries. The suit was filed on behalf of the families by the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe court saw through this attempt to impose religious doctrine in public schools and upheld every student\u2019s right to learn free from government-imposed faith,\" John L. Williams, legal director of ACLU of Arkansas said in a statement. \"We\u2019re proud to stand with our clients \u2014 families of many different backgrounds \u2014 who simply want their kids to get an education.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Two Washington, D.C.-area statues commemorating the Confederacy will be restored and replaced, in line with President Donald Trump's pushback on recent efforts to reframe America's historical narrative.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced Tuesday that a statue commemorating the Confederacy would be returned to Arlington National Cemetery. The statue, which Hegseth referred to as \u201cThe Reconciliation Monument,\u201d was removed in 2023.",
      "The National Park Service announced Monday that the statue of Albert Pike, a Confederate brigadier general and a revered figure among Freemasons, would resume its previous position in Washington's Judiciary Square, a few blocks from the U.S. Capitol. It was the only outdoor statue of a Confederate military leader in the nation\u2019s capital.",
      "The statue was pulled down with ropes and chains on Juneteenth in 2020 as part of mass protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Confederate statues around the country were toppled by similar protests while several military bases named for Confederate leaders were renamed.",
      "The Pike statue restoration, which is targeted for October, \u201caligns with federal responsibilities under historic preservation law as well as recent executive orders to beautify the nation\u2019s capital and reinstate pre-existing statues,\u201d the park service said in a statement.",
      "On social media Tuesday, Hegseth said the Arlington statue \u201cnever should have been taken down by woke lemmings. Unlike the Left, we don\u2019t believe in erasing American history \u2014 we honor it.\u201d",
      "In 2022, an independent commission recommended that the memorial be taken down, as part of its final report to Congress on renaming of military bases and assets that commemorate the Confederacy.",
      "The statue, unveiled in 1914, features a bronze woman, crowned with olive leaves, standing on a 32-foot pedestal, and was designed to represent the American South. Some of the figures also on the statue include a Black woman depicted as \u201cMammy\u201d holding what is said to be the child of a white officer, and an enslaved man following his owner to war.",
      "In March, Trump issued an executive order entitled \u201cRestoring Truth and Sanity to American History.\u201d It decried post-Floyd efforts to reinterpret American history, stating, \u201crather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame.\"",

      "Pike, who died in 1891, is more known for his decades-long stint as a senior leader of the Freemasons than for his Confederate military career. The Masons lobbied Congress for the right to erect the statue on NPS land in 1901 \u2014 provided that he be depicted in civilian, not military, garb.",
      "But Pike did lead a regiment for the Confederacy during the Civil War. And as the only outdoor statue of a Confederate leader in Washington, D.C., it had been a source of controversy for decades. Even the brief Park Service page on the statue notes that it has \u201cstirred opposition since it was first planned.\u201d",
      "The D.C. Council asked for its removal in 1992. In 2017, Mayor Muriel Bowser struck an agreement with congressional leaders to eventually remove it.",
      "When protesters toppled the statue in 2020 while police officers looked on, Trump \u2014 then in his first term \u2014 called it \u201ca disgrace to our Country\u201d on social media and called for their immediate arrests.",
      "Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's non-voting delegate in Congress, called the Park Service move \u201codd and indefensible\u201d in a statement Monday. Norton said she would introduce legislation to remove the statue permanently and place it in a museum.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve long believed Confederate statues should be placed in museums as historical artifacts,\" she said, \u201cnot remain in parks and locations that imply honor.\u201d",

      "Beach patrol captains reported a dramatic increase in jellyfish activity and stings in July, the most they\u2019ve seen in recent memory. Lewes Beach reported a fourfold increase in stings compared to 2024.",
      "Lion\u2019s manes, which can have 100-foot (30-meter) tentacles, sea nettles and moon jellyfish are some varieties that frequent Delaware\u2019s summertime waters.",
      "Jellyfish blooms have become common from Maine to Florida in recent years. Warming waters can create ideal conditions for jellyfish growth.",
      "Normally, Delaware\u2019s five state parks may report a handful of summer jellyfish stings, said Bailey Noel, a beach patrol captain. But Fenwick Island State Park recently reported 92 stings on a single July day. Three lifeguards were taken to urgent care after swimming in jellyfish-infested waters, Noel said.",
      "The jellyfish at Delaware\u2019s Towers Beach surprised Philadelphia resident Christina Jones, whose two daughters refused to wade back into the water after being stung, she said.",
      "\u201cThe jellyfish are pretty bad,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd not only are they a lot in number, but they\u2019re pretty big.\u201d",
      "Delaware State Beach Patrol started tracking jellyfish stings this year due to the rise in cases, said Noel. Most patrol teams do not track the data.",
      "Lewes Beach Patrol treated 295 stings in 2024, the first year the data was collected, but reported over 1,200 cases so far in 2025, said Capt. Strohm Edwards. Lifeguards started carrying vinegar solutions, which can neutralize the venom agents, to help ease pain, he said.",
      "But vinegar solutions may cause microscopic venom-coated barbs known as nematocysts to discharge, according to some research. Those experts recommend a baking soda slurry.",
      "While venomous, stings from Delaware's lion\u2019s manes and sea nettles typically only cause minor irritation and pain, said Edwards. In cases of severe allergic reactions and symptoms \u2014 nausea, vomiting and trouble breathing \u2014 lifeguards can help.",

Temperature, salinity and food availability influence jellyfish breeding, and in favorable conditions, such as warmer waters, populations can explode.",

      "The jellyfish were near the end of their life cycle, finishing their reproductive phase and laying their eggs. Those jellyfish will die once water temperatures cool, said Keith Bayha, a research collaborator with the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of Natural History.",
      "The jellyfish boom can harm ecosystems and marine industries, said Bayha, who has studied the animals for more than 20 years and helped identify a nettle species. Fish larvae primarily feed on plankton, but jellyfish can eat both the plankton and the fish. And with few natural predators, the jellyfish food chain is an ecological dead end, said Bayha.",

Gloucester, Massachusetts, reminded beachgoers to stay safe around jellyfish in mid-July. And in June, Maine's Ogunquit Fire Department warned beachgoers about the increase in jellyfish after stings were reported.",

      "Black looked around the room as the execution started, lifting his head off the gurney multiple times, and could be heard sighing and breathing heavily. All seven media witnesses to the execution agreed he appeared to be in discomfort. Throughout the execution, a spiritual adviser prayed and sang over Black, at one point touching his face.",

      "Black was executed after a back-and-forth in court over whether officials would need to turn off his implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD. Black, 69, was in a wheelchair, suffering from dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, congestive heart failure and other conditions, his attorneys have said.",

But Tennessee's Supreme Court overturned that decision Thursday, saying the other judge lacked authority to order the change.",

      "The lawsuit, announced Tuesday, said Officer Brandon Mills shot Rashaud Johnson, 32, twice in the chest on May 12 when he posed no threat. Mills held him at gunpoint as Johnson bled on the ground, waiting about five minutes for another officer to arrive without trying to help, the lawsuit said.",

Employees had called 911 five times over about two hours asking for police to check on Johnson as he walked barefoot on the lot\u2019s hot pavement, according to the lawsuit and information previously released by police.

      "Johnson pulled one of Mills\u2019 spare ammunition magazines from his belt, the lawsuit said. After Mills pushed Johnson off him and ordered him to move back, Mills pulled out his gun and said he would shoot Johnson if he didn\u2019t get on the ground. Johnson stood still, not far from the lot\u2019s fence, before he slowly began walking toward Mills, according to the footage. Mills then shot him from about 15 feet (5 meters) away.",

Her love of country music was instant; her mother sang, and her father played the banjo. When she was a child, she sang on local radio programs and performed on local television. In her early 20s, she moved to Los Angeles to kick-start a career, taking a job with Liberty and Imperial Records in Hollywood.",
      "She kept writing and recording. Nashville was next: She sang on Porter Wagoner's show; she got a deal with Monument Records. Her greatest hit would arrive soon afterward: \"Don't Touch Me,\" the crossover ballad written by Hank Cochran. The song earned Seely her first and only Grammy Award, for best country & western vocal performance in the female category.",
      "Cochran and Seely were married in 1969 and divorced in 1979.",
      "Seely broke boundaries in her career \u2014 at a time when country music expected a kind of subservience from its women performers, Seely was a bit of a rebel, known for wearing a miniskirt on the Grand Ole Opry stage when it was still taboo.",
      "And she had a number of country hits in the '60s and '70s, including three Top 10 hits on what is now known as Billboard's hot country songs chart: \"Don't Touch Me,\" 1967's \"I'll Love You More (Than You Need)\" and 1973's \"Can I Sleep In Your Arms?\", adapted from the folk song \"Can I Sleep In Your Barn Tonight Mister?\"",
      "In the years since, Seely continued to release albums, perform and host, regularly appearing on country music programming. Her songs are considered classics, and have been recorded by everyone from Merle Haggard, Ray Price and Connie Smith to Ernest Tubb, Grandpa Jones and Little Jimmy Dickens.",
      "And Seely never stopped working in country music. Since 2018, she's hosted the weekly \"Sunday's with Seely\" on Willie Nelson's Willie's Roadhouse SiriusXM channel. That same year, she was inducted into the Music City Walk of Fame.",
      "She appeared nearly 5,400 times at the Grand Ole Opry, which she has been a member of since 1967. Grubbs said Saturday's Grand Ole Opry show would be dedicated to Seely.",
      "She released her last song in July 2024, a cover of Dottie West's \"Suffertime,\" recorded at the world-renowned RCA Studio B. She performed it at the Opry the year before.",

    "published": "Fri, 01 Aug 2025 15:38:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

      "Former Food Network star Paula Deen announced Friday the abrupt closure of the Savannah restaurant that launched her to fame with its menu of fried chicken, banana pudding and other indulgent Southern dishes.",
      "Deen ran The Lady & Sons restaurant with her two sons, Jamie and Bobby Deen, for nearly three decades. Loyal fans visiting Savannah continued to line up for Deen's buffet long after the Food Network canceled her show, \"Paula's Home Cooking,\" in 2013.",
      "But 78-year-old Deen said Friday that The Lady & Sons closed for good along with her second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box. A statement posted on Deen's website and social media accounts didn't say why the restaurants had shut down.",
      "\"Hey, y'all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady & Sons and The Chicken Box,\" Deen's statement said.",
      "\"Thank you for all the great memories and for your loyalty over the past 36 years,\" she said. \"We have endless love and gratitude for every customer who has walked through our doors.\"",
      "Deen said her four restaurants outside Savannah will remain open. They're located in Nashville and Pigeon Forge, Tennessee; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Branson, Missouri.",
      "Deen said Friday she and her sons will visit the Branson establishment on Aug. 8, and said the family is \"excited to continue visiting these restaurants regularly.\"",
      "\"Savannah will always be our home, and we'll always be here to support our wonderful community,\" she said in the statement.",
      "Hey, y\u2019all, my sons and I made the heartfelt decision that Thursday, July 31st, was the last day of service for The Lady...",
      "Windows at The Lady & Sons were covered with brown paper on Friday. Signs posted at the front entrance read: \"It is with heavy hearts and tremendous gratitude that we announce that we have retired and closed.\"",
      "Martin Rowe works in a downtown office across the street from Deen's restaurant. He said business seemed to be going strong up until it closed.",
      "\"Nobody knew anything was wrong,\" Rowe said. \"I walk by there two or three times a week at lunch, and it was always packed.\"",
      "Deen was divorced and nearly broke when she moved to Savannah with her boys in 1989 and started a catering business called The Bag Lady. She opened her first restaurant a few years later at a local Best Western hotel, then started The Lady & Sons in downtown Savannah in 1996.",
      "The restaurant soon had lines out the door and served roughly 1,100 diners per day at the height of Deen's popularity. A USA Today food critic awarded The Lady & Sons his \"meal of the year\" in 1999.",
      "Deen moved her Savannah restaurant to a larger building nearby the year after The Food Network debuted \"Paula's Home Cooking\" in 2002. Filmed mostly in her home kitchen, Deen taped more than 200 episodes over the next decade.",
      "The Food Network canceled Deen's show in 2013 amid fallout from a lawsuit by a former employee. A transcript of Deen answering questions under oath in a legal deposition became public, which included Deen's awkward responses to questions about race.",
      "Asked if she had ever used the N-word, Deen said, \"Yes, of course,\" though she added: \"It's been a very long time.\"",
      "Deen returned to television on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars,\" on chef Gordon Ramsay's Fox show \"MasterChef: Legends,\" and on Fox Nation, which began streaming \"At Home With Paula Deen\" in 2020. She also posts cooking videos to a YouTube channel that has more than 520,000 subscribers.",

      "\"There's all kinds of reasons, no matter what your political affiliation or ideology is, to support this,\" said state Sen. John Damoose, a Republican and ardent supporter of the program.",

      "\"It allowed us to really enjoy being new parents,\" she said.",
      "The program relies heavily on philanthropic donations, but Hanna's long-term goal is for the government to be the main provider.",
      "\"I see philanthropy as the doula of this program; they are helping birth it,\" she said. \"They are helping us prove that this is possible.\"",
      "Democrats in Michigan's state Senate introduced legislation in February that would make the program available to any pregnant woman in the state and it has bipartisan support. But with a divided Legislature only able to pass six bills total this year, it's unlikely the program will yet expand statewide soon.",

    "summary": "U.S. home prices are dropping the most in the South and West, according to a new report from Realtor.com.",
    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets as homes stay on the market longer and new listings climb.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Miami exploded, he added. Part of the reason construction in those cities took off, Krimmel added, was that the laws in their respective state make it easier to build during big influxes in demand.",
      "\"[Builders] we're actually able to get things permitted, get shovels in the ground and get buildings built,\" Krimmel said.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",
      "\"To the extent that there are falling prices in the Northeast and the Midwest, for the most part it's pretty modest numbers,\" said Krimmel.",

      "In the fourth quarter, Disney anticipates that total Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions will increase more than 10 million compared with the third quarter, with most of the increase coming from Hulu due to the expanded Charter deal, CEO Bob Iger and Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said in prepared remarks.",
      "The company expects a modest increase in the number of Disney+ subscribers in the fourth quarter.",
      "Iger and Johnston also said that Disney will stop reporting the number of paid subscribers for Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ streaming services because the metric has become less meaningful for evaluating the performance of its businesses. The company will stop reporting the metric for Disney+ and Hulu beginning with fiscal 2026's first quarter and will no longer report the figure for ESPN+ starting with fiscal 2025's fourth quarter.",
      "The Experiences division, which includes Disney's six global theme parks, its cruise line, merchandise and video game licensing, reported operating income increased 13% to $2.52 billion. Operating income climbed 22% at domestic parks. Operating income declined 3% for international parks and Experiences.",

      "For fiscal 2025, Disney now anticipates adjusted earnings of $5.85 per share. It previously predicted $5.75 per share. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect full-year earnings of $5.80 per share.",
      "While Disney continues to pull levers to successfully manage all of the different components of its business, it's also working on its search for a successor to Iger, the face of Disney for most of the past two decades.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 17:18:28 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump said two major banks turned down his business. Here's why conservatives are concerned with so-called debanking.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Tuesday claimed that major banks are discriminating against conservatives \u2014 including him \u2014 through the act of debanking, or when financial institutions refuse to work with some individuals or businesses or abruptly close clients' accounts.",
      "Mr. Trump made the comment in an\u00a0interview with CNBC on Tuesday, after he was asked about a report\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal that said he would soon sign an executive order aimed at stamping out debanking. Mr. Trump claimed that JPMorgan Chase gave him 20 days to close his account, although he didn't specify when this occurred or what reason he was given by the bank for doing so. He also claimed that Bank of America refused his business after he left JPMorgan.",
      "The issue of debanking has become a sticking point for some conservatives who claim that they've been unfairly targeted by financial institutions. Debanking can occur for a number of reasons, such as if a financial institution detects potentially fraudulent activity or the account owner is overdrawn, but some conservatives claim they have been rejected due to their political views.",
      "\"They discriminated against many conservatives,\" the president told CNBC.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan rejected such allegations of bias against conservatives, in a recent interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that took place ahead of Mr. Trump's comments on CNBC. Moynihan pointed to the nation's second-largest bank's massive customer base as evidence of its diverse clientele. He also emphasized the impact of federal regulations, in addition to concerns over legal and financial risk, on banking decisions.",
      "\"We have 70 million consumers, and we're the biggest small business lender. That's not \u2014 the issue they're focused on is the regulators impact on this industry. And you heard Senator Scott talk about this this week. This reputation, this after the fact, look, that you banked x, and now after the fact, you're gonna say x didn't turn out to be what you thought,\" the CEO told Margaret Brennan. \"So we look at it. We look at it based on risk. People may feel those decisions are made for some other reason, but we always make it on what's best for our company, what's best for our client.\"",
      "At a\u00a0Senate hearing\u00a0in February over the issue, Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, said debanking harms individuals as well as the economy, and violates the principles of fair market access. Debanking has also been highlighted by some crypto investors, such the CEO of crypto platform Anchorage Digital, who\u00a0testified\u00a0in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "The White House declined to comment on the EO.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that it doesn't close accounts for political reasons, adding that it agrees with Mr. Trump that \"regulatory change is desperately needed.\" It added, \"We're pleased to see the White House is addressing this issue, for which we've been advocating for many years, and look forward to working with them to get this right.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Bank of America said, \"Political beliefs are not a factor in account closure decisions.\" Referring to the reported EO, the bank said in a statement that it welcomes \"regulatory clarity\" from the Trump administration.",
      "Reached for comment on Mr. Trump's recent comments, Bank of America pointed to its earlier statement.",
      "What happens when someone is debanked?",
      "Debanking isn't just happening at banks, said Nicholas Anthony, a policy analyst at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute.",
      "\"This can be something that happens to you at a credit union, at a cryptocurrency exchange or anywhere else really,\" Anthony said. \"It's just having that sudden abrupt closure of your financial account where you've been, and essentially kicked out of the system or cut off from the system.\"",
      "Banks are not required by law to give account owners a reason for why their account is being closed. Under the Bank Secrecy Act, banks are obligated to track their customers' activity and file a so-called suspicious activity report (or SAR) if they notice anything unusual. Banks aren't allowed to disclose to customers if there's a SAR, which can leave some people in the dark if their account is shut for this reason.",
      "\"It's a terrible feeling to suddenly have this relationship cut off, and you really don't know why,\" Anthony said. \"In a lot of cases, it's by federal law that banks can't tell you what happened, and you're kind of left to just spiral there.\"",
      "How many people are impacted by debanking?",
      "More than 8,000 consumers filed complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the last three years related to their financial institutions' \"improperly closing checking, savings or other deposit accounts,\" according to a February analysis from the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.",
      "By comparison, consumers made about 1.3 million complaints about credit reporting in 2023 alone, according to CFPB data.",
      "Why do banks close accounts?",
      "Banks can close accounts if they suspect fraudulent or suspicious behavior, or if a customer violates their terms. In the complaints cited by the Senate banking committee analysis, some consumers said they had faced overdraft fees due to overdrawn funds before their banks shuttered their accounts, for example.",
      "But there's no data that tracks whether people or institutions are debanked due to their political views, although there are anecdotal accounts, experts said.",
      "\"There is no actual data or proof that conservatives are being debanked for their beliefs,\" Jeremy Siegel, senior associate at research firm Pleiades Strategy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In fact, Florida set up a hotline for this very reason, and got zero complaints. A Virginia Credit League Lobbyist said this in his testimony against a similar bill in Virginia.\"",
      "Banks set risk tolerances and conduct their business within those perimeters, added Shayna Olesiuk, director of banking policy at Better Markets, a financial advocacy group.",
      "\"They must always understand and manage any risk that they are accepting in their business activities and decisions; this could include things like financial risk or unlawful or discriminatory activity,\" she added.",
      "What about political views and debanking?",
      "There have been allegations from some conservatives that their political views led to account closures. The attorney general for Kansas, Kris W. Kobach, sent a\u00a0letter to Bank of America last year, alleging discrimination by the bank of religious groups he states had their accounts closed without explanation.",
      "Banking policies appear \"to be systematically punishing religious and political views with which it disagrees,\" the Kobach claimed in the letter.",
      "But some of these organizations had red flags that could have led to the debanking, such running a debt collection business outside of the U.S., Cato's Anthony added.",
      "\"There are anecdotal cases of conservative account holders that have had their accounts closed, but at the same time, we see that with others as well,\" he added. \"There's been a longstanding history of people who are Muslim having their accounts denied, people with Russian last names or Middle Eastern last names for that matter, having their accounts denied.\"",
      "\"It seems to be a widespread issue in the sense that it affects all different sorts of people,\" Anthony said.",

      "Out-of-pocket costs jumped by $592.53 per month for the six months after a diagnosis, according to a recent\u00a0report published in JAMA Open Network.",
      "The study underscores the financial toll a cancer diagnosis can take on individuals, even for those who are insured but don't yet qualify for Medicare. While cancer tends to strike later in life, when most patients in treatment are receiving Medicare benefits, a cancer diagnosis can pose an undue financial burden on younger people with private insurance, the report found.",
      "Those out-of-pocket costs highlight the need for policy reform, the report said.",
      "The research \"underscores the need for policies such as paid sick leave that address both insurance continuity and financial assistance, especially for patients with more advanced cancer,\" the report states.",
      "Out-of-pocket costs increased based on a patient's cancer progression, the analysis found.",
      "Patients with stage 0 cancer saw their costs rise by $462 per month compared to non-cancer patients, while stage 4 cancer cost people with private insurance an additional $719.97 per month in out of pocket costs. Costs rise as the disease progresses because patients typically require more treatment during cancer's later stages, leading to greater medical expenditures.",
      "\"This result seems straightforward; later-stage disease is associated with more intensive workup and treatment that can drive higher medical expenditures,\" the report states.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:18:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Revisions are a \"feature, not a bug\" of any jobs report, former BLS commissioner told CBS MoneyWatch.",
    "story": [
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics last week issued a\u00a0steep downward revision\u00a0to May and June's hiring numbers, prompting President Trump to call the edits \"miscalculations\" by the department's commissioner, whom he subsequently fired, in a social media\u00a0post\u00a0on Aug. 1.",
      "While the downward revision of May and June payroll growth by 258,000 marked the largest two-month downward revision to the jobs numbers since 1968, revisions themselves are not uncommon. Revisions are \"a feature, not a bug\" of the agency's reporting process, Erica Groshen, former BLS commissioner under the Obama administration told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Larger revisions have been recorded, but only when the economy has been in a recession, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis of BLS data.",
      "How the BLS processes its reports",
      "The BLS surveys both households and businesses for its monthly jobs report. After releasing an initial report, it's common for the agency to issue revisions to the prior monthly figures, as more accurate data is collected over time.",
      "That's because while some survey recipients respond to the agency's surveys immediately, others report data late. In the interest of reporting employment information in a timely manner, though, the BLS initially issues its monthly jobs report based on an incomplete collection of responses.",
      "\"The BLS wants to get the information as accurate as possible, but it doesn't want to wait too long to put out information that's useful,\" Groshen said. \"So it puts out preliminary numbers, saying they are an estimate, then it gathers more information and improves that estimate.\"",
      "\"If you send out a survey to a bunch of people, some will turn it back in on time and some of them won't,\" Michele Evermore, a former Department of Labor employee and senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive, independent think tank told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The faster you make a determination, the more you're going to have to fill in the blanks,\" she said. In the interim, the BLS relies on scientific modeling to paint a more complete picture of the state of the job market. \"You have to fill in the gaps, and the more reports you get back, the more holes you can fill, and the more accurate a report you get.\"",
      "Eventually, the inclusion of late responses to surveys by both employers and workers enables the agency to provide a more accurate picture of the state of hiring and unemployment in the U.S., Evermore explained.",
      "The cuts to the number of jobs that were added in May and June were spread out across both public- and private-sector jobs. The downward revision to public-sector payroll growth \"mostly reflected lower state and local government job gains,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a research note. Private-sector job gains were previously overstated because of incomplete response data, according to the analysts.",
      "Groshen acknowledged that the revisions were \"definitely on the large side,\" but that \"they happen, and are the product of the same monthly process.\"",
      "Cuts pertaining to government jobs were driven primarily by reductions in hiring by state and local education establishments, according to the BLS. Groshen attributes the job cuts to the expiration of pandemic-era government subsidies that are leading to a pullback in hiring.",
      "\"These subsidies were cut, so they are not hiring as many people as they had been in the past, and state and local governments often report late, so that information came in late,\" she said.",
      "Evermore, of The Century Foundation, noted that the BLS revisions only apply to jobs that were added in both May and June, and not to \"the pool of all the jobs in the U.S.\"",
      "\"While it seems like a big revision, percentage-wise, it's floating on top of the entire labor market. So while it's big, it's not as dramatic as some people are acting like it is,\" she said.",
      "Dismissal of BLS commissioner",
      "In his Truth Social post on Friday, Mr. Trump accused BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer of political bias before announcing her dismissal in response to the downward revision of jobs numbers. \"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes,\" the president\u00a0wrote.",
      "Despite being probed for answers,, the White House has not provided any evidence that the numbers were manipulated for political purposes.",
      "According to Groshen, the drastic revise of the job numbers don't reflect a \"failure\" of the BLS to do its job.",
      "\"It's not a failure and it's not bias. It's not like the commissioner said, 'Oh, I think I'm going to change that numbers.' The commissioner has no power, no ability to do that.\"",
      "Evermore concurred. \"Having worked with BLS for years, it's impossible to cook the books as things stand,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "On Tuesday, California congressman Rep. George Whitesides, a Democrat, introduced a bill that his office said would prevent the president from \"unjustly firing the head of a statistical agency for politically-motivated reasons.\"",
      "Called the Statistical Agency Integrity and Independence Act, it asserts that a President may only dismiss the head of a federal statistical agency for cause, including demonstrated inefficiency.",
      "\"Now more than ever, as our economy reels from the impacts of haphazard tariffs and instability, we need data we can trust,\" Whitesides said in a statement Tuesday. He added that Mr. Trump's decision to fire McEntarfer \"sets a dangerous precedent.\"",
      "Data collection",
      "For years, it's become increasingly difficult to collect complete data based on surveys fielded to hundreds of thousands of employers and individuals, according to Groshen.",
      "\"There is a very long-term term trend of a declining response rate, which is bedeviling the system,\" she said. That's in part because some surveys are fielded over the phone, and American households are increasingly ditching landlines.",
      "Jeff Strohl, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, a research policy institute, echoes others in noting that BLS releases monthly jobs numbers knowing that they'll be revised. But the agency prioritizes timeliness over 100% accuracy because \"the currency of the data is still important,\" he said.",
      "Low response rates \u2014 only about 70% of employers surveyed respond on time \u2014 make revisions inevitable. according to Strohl. \"A month later, the response rate goes up to 90%-95%, so you have 25%, or 150,000, more firms reporting their data,\" he said.",
      "Additionally, weekly shocks to the economy, such as created by tariffs, adds another layer to the challenge of releasing accurate jobs data each month.",
      "\"The U.S. economy is going through a huge number of shocks on a weekly basis,\" Strohl told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Tariffs are being threatened and applied, and there is a level of economic uncertainty affecting the job market.\"",
      "For example, he said, some job seekers are having offers rescinded as major universities lose research grants. \"That's stopping hires from working on projects the money was going to feed,\" he said.",

      "Women have made significant gains in the workplace over the past two decades, but one segment of female workers has been left behind: those without a college degree.",
      "New research shows a growing divide in progress in the workforce between women who have earned at least a bachelor's degree and those without any higher education.",
      "The share of college-educated women in the workforce increased by nine percentage points between 2004 and 2024, research from Third Way, a think tank advocating for moderate policy, shows. Meanwhile, women without a college degree barely notched gains: The share of noncollege women in the workforce increased by less than a percentage point over the same period, according to the report.",
      "\"This divergence in the labor force experience of women with and without college degrees speaks to changes in recent years in the workplace, and around the culture of work,\" Curran McSwigan, Third Way's deputy director of economics and author of the report told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And those changes are weighted toward women with degrees.\"",
      "Flex work",
      "For example, flexible work arrangements are now more common across corporations, allowing some workers to do their jobs from home, at least part of the time, and better balance work with caregiving duties.",
      "\"Remote work has inherently baked in a lot more flexibility, so working mothers may be able to pop out to take their kids to doctors appointments, instead of taking time off,\" McSwigan said.",
      "White-collar firms have also improved benefits related to caregiving, with some even offering workers child care subsidies, allowing mothers to stay in the labor force, according to McSwigan. But women without a college degree are more likely to work in service-sector jobs that aren't as well paid and don't offer the same child care benefits.",
      "\"White collar workplaces are more likely to provide workers with access to paid leave policies, even child care subsidies, and those are not traditionally the same types of benefits you see in more service-sector work that noncollege women are in,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Women in the service-sector may also work variable shifts, and require child care at hours during which day care centers don't typically operate.",
      "\"A lot of day care centers are only open 9 to 5, so they are coming up to other barriers as well, that are inherent to the types of jobs they are working,\" McSwigan said.",
      "Mothers without college sidelined",
      "Working mothers with college degrees notched even greater gains in the work place over the past two decades, with their participation rising by 11 percentage points, from 57% to 68%, according to the report. By contrast, the percentage of noncollege-educated mothers working full-time increased just 0.1% in the last 20 years.",
      "\"We have heard from policymakers that there has been strong labor force bounce back for women and that we are overcoming the 'she-cession' and making progress when it comes to women in workplace,\" McSwigan said. \"But what the data and analysis is showing is these gains can be attributed to college women, and noncollege women are still on workforce sidelines, and it's hard to say we are making progress for working women if only those with college degrees are benefitting.\"",
      "For this reason, McSwigan emphasizes the need for broad-based policy efforts that support \"the different needs that families are facing\" to ensure that all working women receive the same benefits that college-degree holders have.",
      "\"It's not one-size-fits-all approach,\" McSwigan said.",

      "The U.S. job market, already showing the strain from global trade tensions, is showing early signs of another critical issue facing workers today: artificial intelligence.",
      "For the first seven months of 2025, rising adoption of generative AI technology by private employers accounted for more than 10,000 job cuts, according to a report released this week by Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm lists AI as one of the top five factors contributing to job losses in 2025.",
      "Layoffs have jumped this year, adding to fresh concerns about a pullback in hiring after new labor data on Friday showed that employers added only 73,000 jobs in July \u2014 well short of analyst forecasts. Through July, companies have announced more than 806,000 private-sector job cuts, the highest number for that period since 2020, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Of those layoffs, the technology industry wielded the sharpest axe \u2014 private companies in the sector have announced more than 89,000 job cuts, up 36% from a year ago. Since 2023, more than 27,000 job cuts have been directly tied to the advent of AI, according to the firm.",
      "\"The industry is being reshaped by the advancement of artificial intelligence and ongoing uncertainty surrounding work visas, which have contributed to workforce reductions,\" Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The impact of AI on hiring is perhaps most visible among younger workers. Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to recent college graduates have declined 15%\u00a0over the past year, according to Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z employees. Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, the firm found.",
      "While AI is already starting to reshape how Americans work, for now other factors are having a more immediate impact on the labor market. More than 292,000 positions have been eliminated this year due to cuts linked to the Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), an initiative to reduce federal spending spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, Challenger, Gray & Christmas found.",

      "Friday's disappointing July employment report\u00a0delivered a reality check on the U.S. economy, with the data suggesting the job market is wobbling from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs.",
      "What was surprising about the Friday report was that employers not only hired fewer people than expected last month, but the government revised its jobs data sharply downward for the prior two months. With the revisions, the U.S. added 19,000 jobs in May and 14,000 in June, reflecting \"paltry\" employment growth during those months, according to a research note from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco.",
      "The latest jobs data is shedding new light on the U.S. economy as businesses absorb a multitude of changes \u2014 from President Trump's trade deals and fresh tariffs to the new GOP tax law, which provides tax breaks\u00a0to many Americans but also cuts spending on health care and social programs like food stamps. The jobs data backs up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's most recent \"beige book\"\u00a0\u2014 a report that compiles comments from local businesses \u2014 that many companies are delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant jobs report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"We know the economy has ups and downs, and we're in a pretty stagnant place right now.\"",
      "In other words, while the labor market isn't seeing massive layoffs, companies also aren't expanding their hiring plans. That can make it difficult for unemployed workers to find new jobs, with the number of people searching for work for more than 27 weeks jumping 11% to 1.8 million last month compared with a year earlier, government data shows.",
      "Pockets of strength",
      "To be sure, there were pockets of strength in the jobs report, with health care and social assistance adding a combined 73,300 jobs last month, the BLS reported. But many major U.S. employment sectors saw little or no hiring, including leisure and hospitality, transportation and construction, while others \u2014 including manufacturing \u2014 saw job losses last month, the July data shows.",
      "President Trump on Friday claimed without evidence that the jobs report was manipulated for \"political purposes,\" and fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.",
      "He also asserted that the downward revisions were \"a major mistake,\" although the BLS revises its data each month to reflect new information, and the numbers frequently move both up and down.",
      "\"The president's belief that the BLS commissioner personally 'produced' the jobs numbers is preposterous and shows a complete misunderstanding of how government statistical agencies operate,\" noted Heidi Shierholz, the president of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, in a post about McEntarfer's firing.",
      "She added, \"These data are the product of careful work by hundreds of expert economists, statisticians and civil servants following transparent, well-established methodologies.\"",
      "Tariff uncertainty",
      "Businesses have been expressing hesitation given the uncertain impact\u00a0of the Trump's tariffs, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland president Beth Hammack told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"I'm hearing that uncertainty has really been weighing on businesses,\" Hammack said of her discussions with business owners in her district, which spans Eastern Kentucky, Ohio, Western Pennsylvania and part of West Virginia.\u00a0 \"They've been having a tough time to decide when to invest, how much to invest. Many of them have scaled back plans for investment.\"",
      "For instance, one franchise owner said that they planned to refurbish their existing locations, rather than open new locations, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs would revive U.S. manufacturing because companies will reshore or open new factories domestically, rather than pay the import duties.",
      "Some Trump officials portrayed the jobs report as a temporary setback as the administration seeks to revive American jobs through its trade policies.",
      "\"Obviously there were elements of [the jobs report] that we didn't love, but the trade deals are now in place that cover \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 almost 60% of the global economy,\" Stephen Miran, head of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters Friday.",
      "With the setting of new tariff rates on Thursday for dozens of nations, uncertainty has also been resolved, he added. \"There probably were a lot of firms that, you know, sort of sitting there in May and June saying, 'Hey, you know, this tariff stuff's about to be resolved, this bill you know hopefully becomes law within a month or two \u2014 maybe I'm just going to hold off on this investment program.'\"",
      "Also on Friday, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt issued a statement describing a flourishing economy under President Trump. \"Inflation has cooled, wages have increased, unemployment is stable, and the private sector is growing. President Trump's America First agenda has ensured new jobs go to American citizens, instead of illegals or foreign-born workers. The tariffs are raking in billions of dollars to make our country wealthy again,\" the statement read in part.",
      "A decline in manufacturing jobs",
      "The U.S. lost 11,000 manufacturing jobs in July, and the revisions for May and June also show that the sector shed workers during those months. That's notable given Mr. Trump's promise to revive manufacturing jobs, which has led to new agreements from the likes of Johnson & Johnson and Apple to build new plants in the U.S.",
      "But the Trump administration's tariffs have added to the challenges facing the manufacturing sector, especially those producing durable goods such as appliances and automobiles, noted Indeed's Ullrich. For instance, tariffs on imported metals such as steel and aluminum are making it pricier for many manufacturers to create their products, putting pressure on their margins and profits.",
      "The downturn in manufacturing jobs \"is hardly surprising,\" said Scott Paul, president of the trade group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, in an email. \"It's another 'treading water' number, which has been the case more often than not for the past few years. But it is concerning that we're now 173,000 jobs below the most recent peak in February 2023,\" when total nonfarm payroll employment rose to 155.4 million.",
      "It's possible that manufacturing jobs could reverse the trend now that the Trump administration's tariffs and tax policies are settled, Paul added.",
      "Progress on the Trump administration's goal of reshoring American manufacturing jobs may take years, given the cost and time required to build new factories, Ullrich noted. \"There are certain products that, even with the tariffs, are still cheaper to make overseas,\" she added.",
      "\"This is not a healthy job market,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"The economy needs certainty soon on tariffs. The longer this tariff whiplash lasts, the more likely this weak hiring environment turns into layoffs.\"",

      "So far this year, inflation has remained relatively muted despite President Trump's wide-ranging tariffs, partially because many businesses stockpiled goods and manufacturing parts ahead of the import duties' implementation. Some business facing higher tariffs also chose to hold off on passing cost increases onto consumers as they awaited more clarity around where tariff rates would settle. Additionally, the Trump administration instituted numerous pauses on threatened levies, delaying cost increases for businesses and consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates, citing subdued inflation numbers and cuts from other major central banks, such as in the U.K. and the European Union. But the Federal Reserve last week maintained its benchmark rate at the same level where it's been parked since December 2024, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell citing the risks of higher inflation due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "That's a danger also highlighted by Hammack, who said she believes inflation could reach a 3% annual rate this year, representing a pace that would be 1 percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of a 2% annualized rate.",
      "\"Individual businesses have been trying to hold back on, passing on those [tariff] costs, because they're worried about what it might mean for demand,\" Hammack told O'Grady. \"They've been selling inventory that they'd accumulated early in the year, and so they didn't need to charge for the tariffs on that, but they're coming through those stockpiles.\"",
      "She added, \"They're coming to the point where their margins are getting squeezed and they need to start passing that onto consumers.\"",
      "Many households are still struggling with the cost of living, with half of Americans saying they view grocery prices as a major source of stress in their life right now, outpacing housing cost and health care, according to a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\"Two-speed economy\"",
      "Hammack said the U.S. appears to be in a \"two-speed economy.\"",
      "\"The top part of the income spectrum is doing incredibly well,\" she noted. \"They're feeling a lot of excitement about the stock market, how their 401(k)s are doing, and they're feeling flush with cash.\"",
      "But, she added, low-income households are facing a lot of economic challenges.",
      "\"I hear individuals trading down, they go to the supermarket and they can't buy ground beef,\" Hammack said. \"They're buying hot dogs, they're looking at their $400 emergency fund, and it's not able to pay for a new air conditioner or the car repairs that it used to be able to pay for.\"",
      "Price pressures from the Trump administration's tariffs could cause a one-time increase in costs as businesses adjust their prices to cover the import duties, she added. Fed officials are focused on making sure that the price hikes don't become what she calls a \"more persistent inflationary problem.\"",
      "\"What I'm focused on is making sure that we have an economy that's working for all Americans,\" Hammack said. \"Which is why I believe we need to stay really focused on the inflation side of our mandate.\"",
      "At the same time, Friday's disappointing jobs report shows that the labor market is also facing fresh challenges, with employers hiring fewer workers than expected in July.

    "story": [
      "U.S. and Chinese officials may be able to settle many of their differences to reach a trade deal and avert punishing tariffs, but they remain far apart on one issue: the U.S. demand that China stop purchasing oil from Iran and Russia.",
      "\"China will always ensure its energy supply in ways that serve our national interests,\" China's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday following two days of trade negotiations in Stockholm, responding to the U.S. threat of a 100% tariff.",
      "\"Coercion and pressuring will not achieve anything. China will firmly defend its sovereignty, security and development interests,\" the ministry said.",
      "The response is notable at a time when both Beijing and Washington are signaling optimism and goodwill about reaching a deal to keep commercial ties between the world's two largest economies stable \u2014 after climbing down from sky-high tariffs and harsh trade restrictions. It underscores China's confidence in playing hardball when dealing with the Trump administration, especially when trade is linked to its energy and foreign policies.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emerging from the talks, told reporters that when it comes to Russian oil purchases, the \"Chinese take their sovereignty very seriously.\"",
      "\"We don't want to impede on their sovereignty, so they would like to pay a 100% tariff,\" Bessent said.",
      "On Thursday, he called the Chinese \"tough\" negotiators, but said China's pushback hasn't stalled the negotiations. \"I believe that we have the makings of a deal,\" Bessent told CNBC.",
      "Gabriel Wildau, managing director of the consultancy Teneo, said he doubts President Trump would actually deploy the 100% tariff. \"Realizing those threats would derail all the recent progress and probably kill any chance\" for Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to announce a trade deal if they should meet this fall, Wildau said.",
      "In seeking to restrict oil sales by Russia and Iran, a major source of revenue for both countries, the U.S. wants to reduce the funding available for their militaries, as Moscow pursues its war against Ukraine and Tehran funds militant groups across the Middle East.",
      "A CBS News investigation has revealed that\u00a0China is still secretly buying Iranian oil and evading U.S. sanctions by using what's known as a \"dark fleet\" to transfer oil from ship to ship in the middle of the sea.",
      "When Mr. Trump unveiled a sweeping plan for tariffs on dozens of countries in April, China was the only country that retaliated. It refused to give in to U.S. pressure.",
      "\"If the U.S. is bent on imposing tariffs, China will fight to the end, and this is China's consistent official stance,\" said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. WTO is the acronym for the World Trade Organization.",
      "Negotiating tactics aside, China may also suspect that the U.S. won't follow through on its threat, questioning the importance Mr. Trump places on countering Russia, Tu said.",
      "Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese Business and Economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Beijing is unlikely to change its posture when it sees inconsistencies in U.S. foreign policy goals toward Russia and Iran, whereas Beijing's policy support for Moscow is consistent and clear. It's also possible that Beijing may want to use it as another negotiating tool to extract more concessions from Mr. Trump, Kennedy said.",
      "Danny Russel, a distinguished fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said Beijing now sees itself as \"the one holding the cards in its struggle with Washington.\" He said Mr. Trump has made it clear he wants a \"headline-grabbing deal\" with Xi, \"so rejecting a U.S. demand to stop buying oil from Iran or Russia is probably not seen as a deal\u2011breaker, even if it generates friction and a delay.\"",
      "Continuing to buy oil from Russia preserves Xi's \"strategic solidarity\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and significantly reduces the economic costs for China, Russel said.",
      "\"Beijing simply can't afford to walk away from the oil from Russia and Iran,\" he said. \"It's too important a strategic energy supply, and Beijing is buying it at fire\u2011sale prices.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 80% to 90% of the oil exported by Iran went to China. The Chinese economy benefits from the more than 1 million barrels of Iranian oil it imports per day.",
      "After the Iranian parliament floated a plan to shut down the Strait of Hormuz in June following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, China spoke out against closing the critical oil transit route.",
      "China also is an important customer for Russia, but is second to India in buying Russian seaborne crude oil exports. In April, Chinese imports of Russian oil rose 20% over the previous month to more than 1.3 million barrels per day, according to the KSE Institute, an analytical center at the Kyiv School of Economics.",
      "This past week, Mr. Trump said the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on goods from India, plus an additional import tax because of India's purchasing of Russian oil. India's Foreign Ministry said Friday its relationship with Russia was \"steady and time-tested.\"",
      "Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and a top policy adviser, said Mr. Trump has been clear that it is \"not acceptable\" for India to continue financing the Ukraine war by purchasing oil from Russia.",
      "\"People will be shocked to learn that India is basically tied with China in purchasing Russian oil,\" Miller said on Fox News Channel's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" He said the U.S. needs \"to get real about dealing with the financing of this war.\"",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, is pushing for sanctions and tariffs on Russia and its financial backers. In April, he introduced a bill that would authorize the president to impose tariffs as high as 500% not only on Russia but on any country that \"knowingly\" buys oil, uranium, natural gas, petroleum products or petrochemical products from Russia.",
      "\"The purpose of this legislation is to break the cycle of China \u2014 a communist dictatorship \u2014 buying oil below market price from Putin's Russia, which empowers his war machine to kill innocent Ukrainian civilians,\" Graham said in a June statement.",
      "The bill has 84 co-sponsors in the 100-seat Senate. A corresponding House version has been introduced, also with bipartisan support.",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "More than a dozen states are seeking their own versions of Medicaid work requirements. But the incoming new federal standards pose new questions.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump signed a law adding work requirements for some Medicaid recipients, he may have undercut lawmakers in at least 14 states who were designing their own plans, according to health industry observers.",
      "Georgia is the only state with a work requirement in place for Medicaid, but several states have been pursuing such a policy for years, only to be blocked by courts or, most recently, the Biden administration. Some seek state-specific touches to the new rules. Others aim to implement work requirements before the federal law takes effect at the end of 2026.",
      "These states' moves and Mr. Trump's massive tax-and-spending law share one demand: To keep their Medicaid health coverage, adults who can work must prove they're logging a minimum number of hours at a job or school, or else qualify for one of the few exemptions.",
      "But now, states that jumped ahead need to ensure their proposals, which require federal approval, don't stray too far from Mr. Trump's law.",
      "\"The statute sets both the floor and ceiling\" for work requirements, said Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor with George Washington University.",
      "South Dakota, for example, announced in July that it would not submit an application for work requirements as previously planned amid concerns that the state's laxer rules would not be allowed under the new federal law. The state's Department of Social Services secretary had warned that working on a state proposal while the federal rules are being hashed out could be \"an exercise in futility.\"",
      "Arkansas' plan, on the other hand, is more stringent than the federal law. There are no exemptions to its work requirements in the application, which is pending with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "Arizona's proposal also includes something that's not in the federal law: a ban on \"able-bodied adults\" receiving Medicaid benefits for longer than five years total in their lives.",
      "Arkansas and Arizona government officials said they were working with federal officials to square their plans with the new standards.",
      "Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the department is analyzing how the new federal standards interact with state waivers.",
      "The federal health department must release rules by next June that outline how states are to implement work requirements, according to Elizabeth Hinton, who has been tracking such waivers as part of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "\"We don't exactly know what that will cover,\" Hinton said.",
      "It's unclear how federal officials will respond to the states' requests, she added, but \"we are aware that some folks think there is no wiggle room here.\"",
      "States can tweak their Medicaid programs through what are known as demonstration waivers, which are subject to federal approval. The waivers are designed to test new ideas in policy gray areas.",
      "The states that have filed or plan to file such applications with work requirements include Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Utah.",
      "Congressional Republicans who passed the budget reconciliation bill left room for states to use waivers to fast-track the national standards. Tara Sklar, a professor leading the University of Arizona's Health Law & Policy Program, said she expects states seeking certain stricter requirements to have a chance of approval, while more lenient ones may face denials.",
      "Federal officials may look favorably on Arizona's plan, Sklar said, as a five-year lifetime Medicaid limit is different from work requirements. Even if the federal government greenlights stricter work requirements than the federal law calls for, those programs are likely to face legal challenges, she added.",
      "The federal law includes an 80-hour-per-month minimum for work or education, with exemptions for certain adults, including people who are medically frail and parents with young, dependent children.",
      "Montana is the first state to draft a waiver application since Congress finalized national work requirements. State lawmakers first approved work requirements \u2014 called \"community engagement\" standards under the state plan \u2014 in 2019, but the state's application stalled through the end of the first Trump term and the Biden administration.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected again, Montana lawmakers lifted the 2025 expiration date of its Medicaid expansion program, making permanent the program that covered more than 76,000 adults in April, with the expectation that the Trump administration would approve work requirements. In mid-July, state officials released their draft plan to make that a reality \"as soon as is practicable.\"",
      "The Montana plan largely aligns with the federal law, but it would create additional exemptions, including for people who are homeless or fleeing domestic violence.",
      "Republican state Sen. Gayle Lammers said work requirements that also protect such people who need Medicaid were a big part of persuading legislators to keep the expansion program. At the time, officials didn't know where the federal government would land on work requirements. And now, Lammers said, it makes sense for Montana to stick to its plan.",
      "\"The state should have a say,\" Lammers said. \"We're very independent, and everyone is different.\"",
      "In South Carolina, state officials are seeking to roll out work requirements for a limited number of newly eligible Medicaid beneficiaries. South Carolina is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, and yet the state submitted a request with the federal government in June for a partial Medicaid expansion that includes a work requirement component that largely reflects the new federal standards.",
      "In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, a Republican, called South Carolina's proposal \"a state-specific solution.\"",
      "The only state with an active work requirement program now wants to scale it back and awaits federal approval to do so. \"Georgia Pathways to Coverage\" expires at the end of September unless CMS greenlights an extension of the program with a key change: requiring enrollees to document once a year that they're working, not monthly. That's a pivot away from the program's initial design but also differs from the new federal rules, which call for checks every six months.",

    "story": [
      "Jamieson Greer, the U.S. trade representative, said in an interview that aired Sunday that tariff rates are \"pretty much set\" on more than 60 trading partners after President Trump's executive order last week.",
      "\"So these, these tariff rates are pretty much set,\" Greer said in an interview Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan. \"I expect I do have my phone blowing up. There are trade ministers who, who want to talk more and see how they can work in a different way with the United States, but I think that we have, we're seeing truly the contours of the president's tariff plan right now with these rates.\"",
      "Hours ahead of the Trump administration's self-imposed deadline for baseline tariffs on Friday, the White House announced tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries, including a handful that have cut trade deals with the administration and dozens that haven't reached a deal yet. All imports will have a 10% tariff rate as of Aug. 7, according to the executive order.",
      "When asked if Mr. Trump will be negotiating the tariff rate down in coming days, Greer answered, \"I don't think they will be,\" but he added these tariff rates are \"set rates pursuant to deals.\"",
      "\"When the president is looking at this, he looks at potential deals, and we bring him potential concessions from countries and the things they might want to do,\" Greer said. \"And he compares that to the potential tariff that might be applied to try to get that deficit down. And then talking to his advisors, he makes a call on this.\"",
      "Ahead of the Aug. 1 deadline, the Trump administration touted a number of deals for tariffs, including South Korea, the European Union and Britain. But other major U.S. trading partners did not reach deals, including Canada, which Mr. Trump levied a 35% tariff on goods not subject the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Canada is the U.S.' second-largest trading partner.",
      "\"The President's view with with every country, whether it's Canada or Mexico, and regardless of the kind of trade agreement we have in place, is that the net result of the trading system, whether it's our WTO agreements or our existing trade agreements, the net result has been that a lot of the manufacturing has gone overseas, and when that's the net result, you can't continue with that system,\" Greer said.",
      "\"So you know, I'm not concerned that it's going to complicate things with Canada. Our view is the President is trying to fix the terms of trade with Canada, and if there's a way to a deal, we'll find it. And if it's not, we'll have the tariff levels that we have,\" the trade adviser said.",
      "Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, who Brennan interviewed separately on \"Face the Nation,\" said that Bank of America economists have predicted that while the economy will still continue to grow, they are predicting \"less growth than they would have had six, nine months ago, and reflects the impact of the tariff war and the trade and all that.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Aug 2025 09:30:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Nik and Adinah Johnson, who retired in their forties, are part of FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early), a movement that looks at work as a means to an end, and where frugality buys freedom from the rat race.",
    "story": [
      "On a recent Sunday morning, at a Bible camp outside of Gainesville, Florida, Nik Johnson got up to preach, not about hellfire and brimstone, but about a very different fire: Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE). \"Ultimately at the end of the day, financial independence really ain't about us,\" he said. \"It's about people that we love and the causes that we care about.\"",
      "This was Camp FI. Its attendees: retirees and aspiring retirees who looked a little on the young side.",
      "When Johnson met his wife, Adinah, some 30 years ago, she knew right away, he was a saver: \"Our first date, he had a coupon,\" she said.",
      "\"I did use a coupon! And I'm not ashamed about it,\" said Nik. \"I knew that if I presented a coupon and she had an issue with it, she was not my soulmate.\"",
      "Adinah's reaction? \"How many other coupons do you have? What's the best deal? Wait a minute, let's see what we could do here!\"",
      "Nik worked in software, while Adinah was in higher ed. And despite modest starting salaries, they managed to pay off their home and save $1.6 million by consuming less, saving more, and putting 300,000 miles on their beloved minivan, Big Red.",
      "Nik said, \"I shared this with Adinah: I always wanted to be to the point that when I got to 50 I didn't want to have to work. And so honestly, I didn't exactly know how to achieve that.\"",
      "Then, one day during the pandemic, Nik was poking around on the Internet and discovered the FIRE Movement, which led him to Camp FI \u2013 a group of hardcore savers and careful spenders who share tips, tricks and philosophical discourse with basically one goal \u2026 to get out of the rat race.",
      "It's all inspired by Peter Adeney, who blogs under the name Mr. Money Mustache. \"American life is so inefficient,\" he said. \"We're all just kind of following each other, what each other does, and not realizing where all of this time and money is slipping through our hands. So, start doing things that are different from what other people do, would probably be the first piece of advice.\"",
      "Adeney retired at age 30, and turned 50 this year. He said, \"I often think that, because I retired so early, I have lived a lot longer than a normal 50-year-old. Like, I feel like I retired 100 years ago, because I've had so many experiences. It's a great antidote to the usual thing, where people say, 'Life goes by too fast. Then, you miss it.'",
      "\"However, it doesn't solve your happiness problems,\" Adeney said. \"One of my friends who's also a blogger says, like, he still had to confront some demons and some emotional issues. And taking away his job just exposed them more, 'cause he could no longer distract himself from them.\"",
      "The key to saving for retirement, according to Adeney, is to figure out what's important to you \u2013 and trim your spending everywhere else.",
      "Vicki Robin is a sort of mythical figure in the FIRE Movement. She is the co-author (with Joe Dominguez) of the 1992 personal finance book, \"Your Money or Your Life.\" She said, \"As you start to elaborate what's important to you, you realize, like, 'I'm gonna minimize the amount of money I spend, 'cause that's my life energy.' And there's some formula that arises in your mind of, like, 'The less I spend, the more life I have.'\"",
      "Robin's philosophy is less about early retirement and more about asking what is \"enough,\" which differs for everyone. But the consensus of the FIRE Movement is that, to retire, you have to save and invest 25 times your yearly expenses, and then live off of a 4% drawdown each year.",
      "Robin said, \"It's just, 'Okay, how can I have enough for a life that's really happy, but no excess, so that I can liberate my time to do what I find I'm called to do, what I care to do?' And, you know, that evolves over time. I have a little phrase that I've said: I buy my freedom with my frugality every day.\"",
      "A frugality which Nik and Adina Johnson say they are now reaping the rewards of, along with their three children: a life less defined by the \"stuff\" they possess, and more by the freedom they enjoy.",
      "Nik said, \"They're gonna always remember this trip to Disney. But they're not gonna remember, you know, that extra pair of tennis shoes I bought my son. My son's not gonna look at me like, 'Hey Dad, remember that blazer you had on? Man, it was awesome!'\"",
      "Asked what these early retirees' day looks like, Adinah replied, \"Well, I have to pick up the kids, and then I have to take my son to football practice. And then whatever grocery shopping I may have needed to do while I was doing this interview, I need to go ahead and get some of that grocery shopping done.\"",
      "\"Doesn't sound like she needs my help for any of that; I'll probably go play golf,\" Nik laughed.",
      "I observed, \"Seems like one of you is more retired than the other one.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered his administration to fire the commissioner of labor statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the July jobs report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "\"No one can be that wrong? We need accurate Jobs Numbers. I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump wrote on social media.",
      "He added, \"She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified. Important numbers like this must be fair and accurate, they can't be manipulated for political purposes.\"",
      "The president described the latest report, which showed employers in July added a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, as \"a shock,\" adding that the downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June was a \"major mistake.\"",
      "McEntarfer didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Although Mr. Trump claimed, without evidence, that the latest employment report revision for May and June undermines the data's accuracy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics frequently revises its previous job numbers to reflect new information, while past months' numbers are often revised both upwards and downwards. The previous revision was made in the June jobs report, when the BLS revised April and May's numbers higher.",
      "McEntarfer's firing drew criticism from economists and policy experts, who said the move threatens the integrity of economic data from a trusted federal agency",
      "Mr. Trump \"is firing the messenger because he doesn't seem to like jobs numbers that reflect how badly he's damaged the economy,\" Lily Roberts, managing director for Inclusive Growth at the Center for American Progress, a Washington, D.C., think tank, said in a statement.",
      "She added, \"The data he wants to hide is produced by nonpartisan economists who have been doing this work for decades. Politicizing our country's collection of data on what's going on in the economy could shake markets that rely on unbiased information, and it will make it harder to create an economy that makes sure everyone has a good job.\"",
      "Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said in a social media post that Mr. Trump's dismissal of McEntarfer is \"basically unprecedented and will raise concerns about U.S. data integrity going forward,\" noting that BLS also issues closely watched data on inflation, wages and worker productivity.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers also expressed concern about the firing.",
      "\"The statistics are what they are,\" Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told CBS News. \"It's not the statistician's fault if the numbers are accurate and that they're not what the president had hoped for.\"",
      "In a social media post, Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said she supported the firing, and added that Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as acting commissioner. \"A recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\" she wrote.",
      "McEntarfer was named as the 16th commissioner of Labor Statistics in January 2024, after she was nominated by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in early 2024 by the Senate. A labor economist, McEntarfer had spent more than 20 years in positions with the federal government, including the U.S. Census Bureau and the Treasury,\u00a0according\u00a0to her bio.",
      "Stagnating job market",
      "Mr. Trump's firing of McEntarfer came after the July jobs report signaled that the labor market has stalled with employers holding off on hiring in part because of uncertainty of the administration's trade policies.",
      "The July data appears to back up anecdotal evidence from the Federal Reserve's\u00a0most recent \"beige book,\" which compiles comments from local businesses, that many companies were delaying hiring \"until uncertainty diminished.\"",
      "\"Based on what I was hearing from a lot of employers, I kept expecting to see a stagnant job report at some point, that's what we got today,\" Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended President Trump's decision to fire a key official responsible for employment reports, telling CBS News on Friday that Mr. Trump has \"real concerns\" about the accuracy of federal economic data.",
      "Greer spoke to \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" hours after the monthly jobs report showed a hiring slowdown in July and revised down earlier reports for May and June. Mr. Trump reacted by firing Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer, claiming \u2014 without evidence \u2014 Friday's jobs numbers were \"RIGGED.\"",
      "\"You know, even last year during the campaign, there were enormous swings in the jobs numbers, and so it sounds to me like the president has real concerns,\" Greer told CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump's issues with government labor data extend beyond Friday's report.",
      "\"You want to be able to have somewhat reliable numbers. There are always revisions, but sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways,\" said Greer.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics' reports are based on surveys of households and businesses. It's common for the agency to revise prior months' figures up or down as more data comes in. The May and June revisions \u2014 which cut the number of new jobs by a combined 258,000 \u2014 were the largest downward change in employment figures since 1979, excluding pandemic-era jobs reports, though that doesn't mean the data was manipulated, as Mr. Trump claims.",
      "Greer defended Mr. Trump's right to fire McEntarfer, an economist who was nominated to the post by former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"The President is the President. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "The firing drew staunch criticism, with McEntarfer's predecessor William Beach \u2014 who was first nominated in Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 calling it \"groundless\" and a \"dangerous precedent.\"",
      "\"This rationale for firing Dr. McEntarfer is without merit and undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics that are a cornerstone of intelligent economic decision-making by businesses, families, and policymakers,\" Beach said in a statement.",
      "Friday's report showed the economy added 73,000 jobs in July, below the 115,000 predicted by economists. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, up from 4.1% a month earlier.",
      "Greer predicts \"big increase in manufacturing jobs\"",
      "The jobs report also showed a slight drop in manufacturing jobs last month. Mr. Trump's tariff hikes are intended in part to boost American manufacturing \u2014 though critics warn some U.S.-based factories that rely on foreign-made inputs will be hurt by tariffs.",
      "When asked about July's manufacturing data, Greer \u2014 one of Mr. Trump's trade negotiators \u2014 told CBS News he doesn't \"read tariff policy into that number.\"",
      "Instead, Greer argued that the numbers reflect conditions prior to the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act that passed through Congress last month. He argued businesses were \"waiting to see\" if some of the bill's tax provisions would pass, including parts that GOP lawmakers believe will encourage more business investment.",
      "\"I think that we're going to see a big increase in manufacturing jobs now that we have the 'one big, beautiful bill' passed,\" Greer said. \"And I think that \u2026 our manufacturers know that they have a clear and certain path forward on that now.\"",

      "Materials issued by the White House on Thursday outline new tariff rates for dozens of countries, but details remain scant on how to implement the trade agreements, said Barry Appleton, co-director of the New York Law School Center for International Law.",
      "\"The last thing businesses want to have are unanswered questions. They were looking for certainty, and what we have instead is a gigantic Rubik's Cube,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone has been waiting for 'Liberation Day' to be finished,\" he added, referring to the country-based tariff announcements Mr. Trump first made in early April. \"Instead, with this announcement, we have another perpetuation of what's going on.\"",
      "Under the Trump administration's new import duties, most countries will face a baseline tariff of at least 15%, although other nations will faces levies of more than 40%. The U.S. effective tariff rate is now 17%, according to Fitch Ratings \u2014 the highest in decades.",
      "That could mean pricier garments from Vietnam, shoes and toys from China, chocolate from Switzerland, and coffee from Brazil, according to economists. As a result, the revised U.S. tariffs could cost Americans an average of $2,048 per year, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the National Taxpayers Union, a nonpartisan advocacy organization.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued his tariff strategy is necessary to correct what he views as unfair trading practices and revive American manufacturing, and points to still-fairly-low inflation rates. But many economists warn\u00a0tariffs can lead\u00a0to higher inflation and more sluggish economic growth, and some of the president's early trade moves\u00a0rattled financial markets.",
      "The White House has said that Mr. Trump's trade policies benefit Americans.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these historic trade deals and the Administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill's tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "On social media, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the tariffs are \"a knockout win over the distorted global trading order that has disadvantaged American workers, farmers, and manufacturers for decades.\"",
      "He added that Trump's foreign trade policy has achieved \"expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments that will create great American jobs.\"",
      "Which products could get pricier?",
      "In the U.S., the products most commonly imported from abroad \u2014 and therefore most likely to see their prices rise because of sharply higher tariffs \u2014 include household appliances, furniture, cars, clothing, sports equipment, toys and cleaning products, according to an analysis from Oxford Economics.",
      "The price of such goods rose about 1% in June, or more than double the increase in May, according to the investment research firm's analysis of consumption data, a sign that tariffs are starting to seep into the cost of everyday items.",
      "\"The question is really what's not going to go up in price. The costs were being eaten in the profits of companies, but that's not sustainable,\" Appleton said.",
      "Mr. Trump slapped some of the highest tariffs on key trade partners like Canada, a major provider of lumber to U.S. companies. That could lead to higher housing costs, according to Oxford. Some fruits and vegetables also could get pricier this winter as grocery stores leans on imports to stock store shelves, he said.",
      "U.S. automakers including Ford, GM and Stellantis have recently warned that higher U.S. tariffs will reduce their profits by billion of dollars. That is likely to increase new car prices, said Terence Lau, dean of the Syracuse University College of Law and formerly a government affairs executive at Ford.",
      "\"My advice to consumers back in April was that they should wait to buy cars,\" said Lau, who expects dealer prices for 2026 models to rise between 4% and 6%. \"In August, my advice is to buy now.\"",
      "Although many businesses are still selling inventory they imported earlier this year in a bid to avoid higher tariffs, subsequent imports will likely be subject to the newly announced levies when they arrive at U.S. ports, according to trade experts.",
      "\"A lot of businesses front-loaded goods to get them in the door before tariffs were announced. They'll now have to increase their costs as inventories dwindle and businesses start replenishing them,\" Oxford Economics' senior U.S. economist Matthew Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect cost hikes to peak in the second half of the year,\"",
      "Along with facing potentially higher prices, U.S. consumers could face reduced product choices stemming from supply-chain delays, according to economists. That's largely because companies unable to reshore manufacturing to the U.S. are likely to stop importing low-margin goods as they move to control costs.",
      "\"In many cases, tariffs will be so high that we'll create embargoes,\" Martin said. \"That will make it more difficult for retailers and distributors to get things out to market.\"",
      "Rodney Manzo, a supply-chain expert and senior director at Sage, a business management software company, said higher tariffs often end up affecting businesses and consumers in ways beyond the cash register.",
      "\"For the average shopper, the effects don't always show up as a big price hike on the shelf. Instead, it's subtler \u2014 fewer options, smaller quantities and less generous promotions,\" he said. \"Companies are quietly reducing [their stockpiles], reworking product specs or stripping out expensive components to hit margin targets.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency is considering terminating its $7 billion Solar for All program that was designed to bring renewable and affordable energy to low-income communities, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Solar for All program provides funding to 60 grant recipients that planned to create or expand existing low-income solar programs, with the goal of enabling 900,000 households across the country in disadvantaged communities to utilize solar energy to reduce their home energy bills.",
      "CBS News has learned that the Office of Management and Budget reached out to the EPA about terminating the program. The EPA has not come to a final decision on the future of the program.",
      "\"With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, EPA is working to ensure Congressional intent is fully implemented in accordance with the law,\" an EPA spokesperson told CBS News via email when asked if the agency intends to terminate Solar for All.",
      "As of Tuesday night, none of the 60 grant recipients have been formally notified and said they still have access to grant funds. One source told CBS News that several senators, both Republicans and Democrats, have reached out to the EPA and asked it to reconsider, as many of these recipients are state energy and environmental offices in both red and blue states.",
      "The New York Times was the first to report the news.",
      "Groundswell, a nonprofit Solar for All grant recipient that works in eight Southern states, has more than $156 million in grant funding on the line. To date, the group has broken ground on 24 megawatts of solar projects worth over $20 million.",
      "\"This program covers every single state and U.S. territories, more than 60% of the awards went to state energy offices,\" Groundswell CEO Michelle Moore told CBS News. Moore was quick to point out that awards were granted to stakeholders in both red and blue states, adding: \"There's a lot at stake here.\"",
      "As electricity bills rise, which experts believe may only increase as more energy-hungry data centers come online, Moore saw Solar for All as a tool to lower energy costs in the South.",
      "\"Solar for All is an investment in energy infrastructure that's going to serve that residential customer that's going to keep energy rates in America more affordable and more fair,\" she said.",
      "Solar for All awarded grants in August 2024 to 49 state-level agencies, six tribes and five multi-state award recipients, according to the EPA. They include state agencies like the Alaska Energy Authority, which was granted a $62 million award to offer access to renewable energy in both urban and rural areas. Harris County, Texas, which encompasses Houston, was awarded $249 million to provide distributed solar and battery storage to disadvantaged communities in the state, and plan on using the money to support workforce training for low-income residents as well as minority and women-owned businesses.",
      "\"Solar for All was a focused program where grants were used to help low- and middle-income households reduce their household electricity costs by up to 20% through solar and storage,\" said Zealan Hoover, who was a senior adviser to former EPA administrator Michael Regan in the Biden administration. Hoover spent three years at the EPA helping to implement more than $100 billion in programs authorized under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\"If the EPA is successful in terminating these grants, I anticipate most of the grantees will sue for unlawful termination,\" Hoover told CBS News. \"If the EPA is ultimately successful, then most recipients will have lost years of work across the country to help low-income households, and all the work will be for naught.\"",
      "Cody Two Bears, CEO of Indigenized Energy, helps tribes and members of the Menominee Nation pursue what it calls \"energy sovereignty.\" Indigenized Energy belongs to a coalition of tribes that were awarded more than $135 million to build solar projects in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.",
      "Indigenized Energy completed one of the first Solar for All projects in the country earlier this year, despite setbacks when funding had been frozen by the federal government earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "The federal government is calling off around $500 million worth of vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.",
      "The 22 now-terminated projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Most of the projects that were canceled were for vaccines that fight COVID-19 or the flu, Kennedy\u00a0said.",
      "They include proposals from Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur and other drugmakers that were rejected or canceled, along with a now-shuttered award to Moderna to develop a bird flu vaccine, according to an HHS statement. The projects were reviewed and canceled over the last few weeks, said Kennedy.",
      "A Moderna spokesperson told CBS News that the company's H5N1 (bird flu) contract was canceled in May, and it isn't aware of any new BARDA cancellations.",
      "Kennedy framed the move as part of a step away from research into mRNA vaccines. Those types of vaccines\u00a0use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce antibody production to protect against an infection. The approach has drawn more interest since the COVID-19 pandemic, when mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were\u00a0found to be safe and effective against the coronavirus. Public health officials credit the rapid development of the vaccines with saving millions of lives.",
      "Nevertheless, Kennedy said, \"HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.\"",
      "He argued mRNA-based vaccines can stop working properly if the virus that they target mutates too much, citing\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0as an example. \"A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Leading infections disease experts criticized the decision and said it will leave Americans vulnerable.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a virologist and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said Kennedy \"has once again made a decision, not based on scientific evidence that puts this country at unnecessary risk.\"",
      "Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm called it \"one of the worst decisions I've seen in 50 years of public health preparedness work.\"",
      "\"If an influenza pandemic hit us tomorrow, the global flu vaccine manufacturing capacity using the standard method of growing the virus in chicken eggs would only produce enough vaccine in 18 months to vaccinate just one fourth of the world,\" he told CBS News. \"We desperately need a vaccine technology where we could make enough vaccine for the world in a year.\"",
      "Many experts say a major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed, manufactured and changed quickly, allowing drugmakers and public health officials to respond rapidly to novel viruses and to constantly mutating viruses like the flu.",
      "In 2020, the first Trump administration funded the development of Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed significantly faster than traditional vaccines.",
      "\"No other nation matched what America achieved during the pandemic,\" Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, told CBS News. \"We pioneered and delivered life-saving mRNA vaccines at unprecedented speed. It's a historic accomplishment we should celebrate. Clinging to outdated technologies to counter a future flu pandemic is a grave mistake.\"",
      "Kennedy has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of\u00a0raising doubts\u00a0about vaccines. Since he joined the Trump administration, he has fired members of an expert panel that made vaccine recommendations, and announced the removal of a recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still says children may get the vaccine and that it is safe and beneficial for pregnant women.",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that HHS is moving the now-canceled funding to \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"",
      "\"Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" the health secretary said.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line  Gounder and \n                                                  \n                      Stephanie  Stahl\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to remove one of the state's House Democratic leaders, Rep. Gene Wu, calling him \"the ringleader\" of the dozens of Democratic lawmakers who left the state in an effort to block a redistricting vote.",
      "Abbott filed the emergency petition with the Texas Supreme Court to have Wu, who represents Houston and serves as Democratic caucus chair, removed from office. On Sunday, the governor had threatened to seek Democratic lawmakers' removal from office if they did not attend a Monday afternoon House session.",
      "\"They have not returned and have not met the quorum requirements. Representative Wu and the other Texas House Democrats have shown a willful refusal to return, and their absence for an indefinite period of time deprives the House of the quorum needed to meet and conduct business on behalf of Texans,\" Abbott wrote in a statement. \"Texas House Democrats abandoned their duty to Texans, and there must be consequences.\"",
      "Abbott claims Wu has forfeited his elected position and that his actions, as well as those of other House Democrats who left the state, \"constitute abandonment of their office, justifying their removal.\"",
      "The governor also alleged Wu and other House Democrats \"appear to have solicited and received certain benefits in exchange for skipping a vote, further supporting their removal from office and allegations of bribery.\"",
      "Abbott has argued in the past that Democrats can be legally removed from office if they don't show up. He's cited a non-binding 2021 opinion by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that said a \"district court may determine that a legislator has forfeited his or her office due to abandonment and can remove the legislator from office, thereby creating a vacancy.\"",
      "But Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor, has told CBS News the only way to remove a Texas lawmaker \u2014 other than at the ballot box \u2014 is by a two-thirds vote of the legislature.",
      "Texas Democrats break quorum in effort to block redistricting vote",
      "Over the weekend, dozens of Texas Democrats\u00a0fled the state to block a vote\u00a0on a Republican-backed congressional redistricting plan that\u00a0President Trump\u00a0wants before the 2026 midterm elections, escalating a standoff that has stalled the legislative session.",
      "The Democrats' absence meant the Texas House of Representatives did not have enough members present to hold a debate on a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to add five seats favoring Republicans. That prompted a Republican-backed motion for their civil arrest.",
      "Abbott then ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to \"locate, arrest and return any House member who abandoned their duty to Texans.\" However, Texas DPS has no jurisdiction out of state. A civil arrest could force the lawmakers back to the Capitol.",
      "A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. During a previous walkout by Democratic legislators, the Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",
      "Rep. Wu responds to Gov. Abbott's lawsuit",
      "In a statement to CBS Texas, Wu said that \u00a0\"denying the governor a quorum was not an abandonment\" of office, rather it was \"a fulfillment of my oath.\"",
      "\"This office does not belong to Greg Abbott, and it does not belong to me,\" Wu said in his statement. \"It belongs to the people of House District 137, who elected me. I took an oath to the Constitution, not a politician's agenda, and I will not be the one to break that oath.\"",
      "Wu also said that the governor has failed the people of Texas and is \"using the courts to punish those who refused to fail\" with him.",
      "\"When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant,\" Wu's statement reads. \"When that governor holds disaster relief for 137 dead Texans and their families hostage, my moral duty is to sound the alarm \u2014 by any means necessary.\"",
      "Abbott wants the Supreme Court to issue a ruling by 5 p.m. on Thursday.",
      "\"Greg Abbott is attempting to silence House Democratic Caucus leader Rep. Gene Wu by weaponizing the courts,\" Texas Democratic Party Chairman Kendall Scudder said in a statement. \"It is a complete violation of the separation of powers for the governor of this state to think he has the authority to unilaterally remove duly elected officials simply because he disagrees with them using constitutionally protected procedural safeguards.\"",

    "summary": "Texas Republican lawmakers returned to the Capitol without Democrats, who fled to block a vote on a GOP-drawn congressional map.",
    "story": [
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday ordered the civil arrest of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on a Republican-backed congressional redistricting plan, escalating a standoff that has stalled the legislative session.",
      "The absence of the Democratic lawmakers broke quorum, which meant the House did not have enough members present to hold a debate on a bill to redraw the state's congressional districts to add five seats favoring Republicans. That prompted a Republican-backed motion for their civil arrests.",
      "\"In response to this dereliction of duty,\" House Speaker Dustin Burrows said Monday, \"in pursuant to the rules of the House, I am prepared to recognize a motion to place a call on the House and any other motions necessary to compel the return of absent members. Should such a motion prevail, I will immediately sign the warrants for the civil arrests of the members who have said they will not be here.\"",
      "Minutes after the session adjourned, Abbott made a post on his X account with a \"Breaking News\" banner saying he had ordered the arrest of Democrats who fled the state.",
      "Abbott ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to \"locate, arrest and return any House member who abandoned their duty to Texans;\" however, Texas DPS has no jurisdiction out of state. A civil arrest would force the lawmakers back to the Capitol.",
      "Abbott threatens removal from office as Texas Democrats block redistricting vote by breaking quorum",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said he'll begin to remove Democratic lawmakers from office if they don't return after\u00a0dozens of them fled the state\u00a0in a last-resort attempt to block the redrawing of U.S. House maps that\u00a0President Trump\u00a0wants before the 2026 midterm elections, although the legal justification for that is shaky.",
      "\"To those who are absent: return now,\" Burrows said. \"Show the courage to face the issues you were elected to solve, come back and fulfill your duty. Because this House will not sit quietly while you obstruct the work of the people.\"",
      "Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, motioned for the \"Sergeant of Arms, or officers appointed by her,   send for all absentees who attendance is not excused for the purpose of securing and maintaining their attendance under warrant of arrest if necessary, and this order to be continued beyond the adjournment of today's session and until the further order of the House.\"",
      "The motion passed with a vote of 85 to 6.",
      "\"The people of Texas are watching and so is the nation, and if you choose to continue down this road, you should know there will be consequences,\" Burrows said.",
      "\"This is not normal,\" Democratic Rep. Ann Johnson said in an interview with CBS News. \"Do not think that we can turn into a nation where you arrest and jail your political opposition for not only rendering their voice for the people, but doing something that is protected by the Texas Constitution. A quorum break is written into the Texas Constitution. It is a tool our founding fathers gave us. The threat of arrest is something that should be a red alarm for a lot of folks.\"",
      "Trump says GOP is \"entitled to five more seats\"",
      "Appearing on CNBC on Tuesday, Mr. Trump insisted that about redistricting, Democrats \"did it to us.\" Mr. Trump pointed to states like Illinois and Massachusetts, which he said should have more Republican representation.",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted they could pick up five more seats in Texas with new districts. Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the U.S. House going into the 2026 midterms, which historically favor the party not in the White House.",
      "\"We have an opportunity in Texas to pick up five seats,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a really good governor, and we have good people in Texas. And I won Texas. I got the highest vote in the history of Texas, as you probably know. And, we are entitled to five more seats.\"",
      "Texas Democratic legislators flee state to protest GOP's redistricting plan",
      "State House Democrats went to Illinois or New York on Sunday, and Abbott gave them a 24-hour ultimatum to come home, ratcheting up a widening fight over congressional maps that began in Texas but has drawn in Democratic governors who have floated the possibility of rushing to redraw their own state's maps in retaliation. Their options, however, are limited.",
      "At the center of the escalating impasse is Mr. Trump's pursuit of adding five more GOP-leaning congressional seats in Texas before next year that would bolster his party's chances of preserving its slim U.S. House majority.",
      "\"Greg Abbott is trying to silence the voices of Texans and prevent them from picking the elected officials of their choice, and now he's literally saying he's going to remove the representatives that the people have put into office,\" said Democratic State Rep. James Talarico. \"So he's taken a page of Donald Trump's authoritarian playbook, and it's something we should all protect.\"",
      "The new congressional maps drawn by Texas Republicans would create five new Republican-leaning seats. Republicans currently hold 25 of the state's 38 seats.",
      "A vote on the proposed maps had been set for Monday in the Texas House of Representatives, but it cannot proceed if the majority of Democratic members deny a quorum by not showing up. After one group of Democrats landed in Chicago on Sunday, they were welcomed by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, but declined to say how long they were prepared to stay out of Texas.",
      "\"We will do whatever it takes. What that looks like, we don't know,\" said state Rep. Gene Wu, the Texas House Democratic Caucus leader.",
      "But legislative walkouts often only delay passage of a bill, including in 2021 when many of the same Texas House Democrats left the state for 38 days in protest of new voting restrictions. Once they returned, Republicans still wound up passing that measure.",
      "Four years later, Abbott is taking a far more aggressive stance and swiftly warning Democrats that he will seek to remove them from office if they are not back when the House reconvenes Monday afternoon. He cited a non-binding 2021 legal opinion issued by Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which suggested a court could determine that a legislator had forfeited their office.",
      "He also suggested the lawmakers may have committed felonies by raising money to help pay for fines they'd face.",
      "\"This truancy ends now,\" Abbott said.",
      "In response, House Democrats issued a four-word statement: \"Come and take it.\"",
      "The state of the vote",
      "Lawmakers can't pass bills in the 150-member Texas House without at least two-thirds of them present. Democrats hold 62 of the seats in the majority-Republican chamber and at least 51 left the state, said Josh Rush Nisenson, spokesperson for the House Democratic Caucus.",
      "Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows said the chamber would still meet as planned on Monday afternoon.",
      "\"If a quorum is not present then, to borrow the recent talking points from some of my Democrat colleagues, all options will be on the table. . .,\" he posted on X.",
      "Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate, said on X that Democrats who \"try and run away like cowards should be found, arrested, and brought back to the Capitol immediately.\"",
      "Fines for not showing up",
      "A refusal by Texas lawmakers to show up is a civil violation of legislative rules. The Texas Supreme Court held in 2021 that House leaders had the authority to \"physically compel the attendance\" of missing members, but no Democrats were forcibly brought back to the state after warrants were served that year. Two years later, Republicans pushed through new rules that allow daily fines of $500 for lawmakers who don't show up for work as punishment.",
      "The quorum break will also delay votes on flood relief and new warning systems in the wake of last month's catastrophic floods in Texas that killed at least 136 people. Democrats had called for votes on the flooding response before taking up redistricting and have criticized Republicans for not doing so.",

    "summary": "\"Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Ghislaine Maxwell is not,\" Maxwell's attorney David Markus wrote in the court filing.",
    "story": [
      "Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are arguing against the Justice Department's attempt to unseal grand jury testimony against her, writing in a court filing Tuesday that their client \"has no choice but to respectfully oppose\" the potential release.",
      "\"Jeffrey Epstein is dead. Ghislaine Maxwell is not,\" Maxwell's attorney David Markus wrote in a nine-page filing. \"Whatever interest the public may have in Epstein, that interest cannot justify a broad intrusion into grand jury secrecy in a case where the defendant is alive, her legal options are viable, and her due process rights remain.\"",
      "In her interview with the Justice Department, Maxwell did not implicate President Trump in Jeffrey Epstein's misdeeds and said nothing that would harm the president, according to a source familiar with the contents of the interview. This was first reported by ABC News.",
      "An administration official also confirmed there is an audio recording and transcript of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's conversation with Maxwell, a standard practice for legal interviews.",
      "Maxwell \u2014 who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting, grooming and sexually abusing minors \u2014 is challenging her conviction, arguing she should've been covered by a non-prosecution deal that federal prosecutors in Florida offered to Epstein and any co-conspirators almost two decades ago. The Supreme Court indicated it will consider whether to hear Maxwell's case in September.",
      "Her attorneys also wrote that Maxwell has not been given the opportunity to review the grand jury material to assess the documents.",
      "\"When Epstein died, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York pivoted and made Maxwell the face of his crimes. She became the scapegoat and the only person the government could put on trial. She was convicted in a media firestorm of false reporting and mischaracterization of evidence,\" Markus wrote. \"Now, with her case pending before the Supreme Court, the government seeks to unseal untested, hearsay-laden grand jury transcripts, which contain statements presented in secret and never challenged by the adversarial process.\u00a0 Maxwell has never been allowed to review those transcripts even though the government did not oppose her recent request to do so.\"",
      "In a court filing last week, the Justice Department admitted that the grand jury transcripts that it is attempting to unseal from the investigations into the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his former associate Ghislaine Maxwell contain testimony from only two law enforcement officers.",
      "The grand juries that indicted Epstein and Maxwell did not hear direct testimony from any alleged victims, Attorney General Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told a judge in the Southern District of New York in their attempts to unseal the testimony.",
      "In a\u00a0filing earlier Tuesday, the Justice Department said that the grand jury transcripts it is hoping are unsealed were mostly already made public during Epstein and Maxwell's court proceedings.",
      "\"The enclosed, annotated transcripts show that much of the information provided during the course of the grand jury testimony\u2014with the exception of the identities of certain victims and witnesses\u2014was made publicly available at trial or has otherwise been publicly reported through the public statements of victims and witnesses,\" the Justice Department wrote.",
      "The government also has asked for until Aug. 8 to decide whether or not they are going to ask for the grand jury exhibits to be unsealed as well, as those \"substantive\" exhibits that are not currently in the public record.",
      "Epstein accuser Annie Farmer wants grand jury transcripts released",
      "Before a different judge in New York, lawyers for Epstein accuser Annie Farmer asked for the transcripts to be unsealed Tuesday, arguing a public release could help remedy a \"lack of full accountability for Epstein, Maxwell, and their co-conspirators.\"",
      "\"Given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein and Maxwell's crimes, unsealing the grand jury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the full scope of the abuse and those who enabled it,\" they wrote in a letter.",
      "The attorneys said victims' names and identifying information should be redacted, but the court shouldn't \"rubber stamp\" redactions about others who might be mentioned in the transcripts.",
      "Earlier this week, two other unnamed Epstein victims also asked for restrictions to be put in place to protect Epstein and Maxwell's victims, but were unopposed to the transcripts being unsealed.",
      "One victim asked for the judge to \"show us all the files with only the necessary redactions!\" and \"be done with it and allow me/us to heal.\"",
      "They asked that their attorney be able to review the suggested redactions \"as they are the ones who also know the victims, their names, their truths and their stories unlike the United States Government who did not and does not even care to know our truth. They would rather ask a convicted imprisoned sex trafficker/ abuser for information,\" referring to the Justice Department's two-day interview last month with Maxwell.",
      "Another victim asked for a third-party review of the files before their release, to \"ensure that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed through this release. It is imperative with the scrutiny over this media frenzy that the victims are completely and entirely protected.\"",
      "Meanwhile, lawyers for Epstein's estate are taking no position on the Justice Department's motion to unseal transcripts, they said in a court filing Tuesday.",
      "Last month, a federal judge in Florida denied the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material stemming from investigations in 2005 and 2007 into Epstein in the state. That ruling only applied to transcripts of proceedings by federal grand juries that were convened in Florida, and did not apply to the transcripts in New York.",
      "Trump administration could release parts of Maxwell-Blanche conversation",
      "Late last month, Blanche met with Maxwell over the course of two days. There are now ongoing discussions among Trump administration officials about whether to make some of those conversations public, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "Blanche said last month the Justice Department will \"share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time.\" It's not clear what topics they covered: Markus has\u00a0said Maxwell was asked about \"100 different people\" and answered \"every single question,\" but hasn't elaborated on the substance of their conversation.",
      "An administration official confirmed there is audio and a transcript of Blanche's discussions with Maxwell, a standard practice for legal interviews.",
      "CNN was first to report on discussions about releasing the Blanche-Maxwell conversations.",
      "Asked for comment, White House spokesman Stephen Cheung said, \"This is nothing more than CNN trying desperately to create news out of old news.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge issued an injunction Tuesday halting the administration's attempt to reallocate over $4 billion in disaster preparedness funding.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to reallocate more than $4 billion in federal funding geared toward natural disaster mitigation projects, arguing the transfer could lead to \"irreparable harm\" to flood-prone areas.",
      "The injunction by U.S. District Judge Richard G. Stearns in Boston followed a July lawsuit brought by 20 states. They argued that FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program had been unlawfully terminated in April 2025 under the Trump administration, with more than $4 billion in unspent funding that had been allocated by Congress redirected without its authority. Stearns wrote that the court was \"not convinced\" that Congress had intended for the money to be reallocated.",
      "\"The BRIC program is designed to protect against natural disasters and save lives,\" Stearns wrote.",
      "Stearns ruled that government officials were temporarily blocked from repurposing the funds while the court considers the state's objections to the cuts.",
      "The July lawsuit alleged that ending the BRIC program would upend disaster preparedness efforts across the country, leaving communities unable to tap into critical funding for hundreds of already-approved resilience projects. Before it was halted, the BRIC program provided funding for local infrastructure projects such as stormwater management systems and the relocation or elevation of buildings in flood-prone zones.",
      "FEMA officials originally announced in April that they were \"ending\" the BRIC program because it is \"wasteful\" and had become more concerned with \"political agendas than helping Americans recover from natural disasters.\" But in a court filing last week, the disaster response agency walked back those comments, stating that they hadn't cut the program and were still evaluating whether they will end or revise it.",
      "A CBS News investigation\u00a0in June revealed that the recent BRIC funding cuts have disproportionately affected counties that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, with two-thirds of the counties that lost funding having voted for the president. The elimination of the BRIC program will especially deprive vulnerable communities across the Southeast \u2014 an area prone to natural disasters \u2014 the CBS News data analysis found."

    "story": [
      "Crime decreased in every category in 2024, including murder, violent crime and motor vehicle thefts, according to data released by the FBI on Tuesday. It reflects a trend experts have been tracking as reported numbers of violent crimes continue to drop from a spike immediately following the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "While the report included good news, a violent crime still occurred on average every 25.9 seconds in the United States last year, according to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, which compiles crime statistics submitted by law enforcement agencies across the country. This year's report used data submitted by 16,675 different agencies, which the FBI said covers a combined population of more than 325 million people, or about 95.6% of U.S. residents.",
      "The FBI's report did not venture to say why the violent crime stats decreased. \"It's difficult if not impossible for us to say why, and each reporting agency would have a different reason why,\" an FBI official said Tuesday in response to a question from CBS News during a briefing.",
      "The FBI did note it has seen an increase in the number of officers shot in the line of duty. \"Between 2021 and 2024, we saw 258 law enforcement officers feloniously killed in the line of duty,\" the FBI official said.",
      "All violent crime decreased last year",
      "Violent crime, which the FBI defines as murder, nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, was down an estimated 4.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, with each subcategory also seeing a decrease.",
      "The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate decreased 14.9% year over year. Robbery dropped by 8.9%. Rape saw an estimated 5.2% decrease and aggravated assault was down 3%, the report found",
      "The murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate dropped for a second straight year, after dropping from 6.5 to 5.7 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2023. In 2024, the rate dropped again, to 5 murders per 100,000 inhabitants. Over the last 20 years, the high mark in the murder rate was recorded in 2020, with 6.7 per 100,000 residents, while the lowest recorded was in 2014, with 4.4 cases per 100,000 people.",
      "Analysis from Jeff Asher, a criminal justice data expert and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics, noted that while murder, rape and robberies have fallen to below pre-COVID levels following a large spike during the pandemic, aggravated assaults, while decreasing, remain \"stubbornly high.\"",
      "In a shift from previous years, both the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office contributed data to the FBI report.",
      "LAPD Chief of Detectives Alan S. Hamilton credited community and violence intervention programs in Los Angeles for contributing to the drop in crime there. \"We made an investment in the future and I think these are the dividends,\" he told CBS News in a phone call Monday night.",
      "Rodney Harrison, former police commissioner of New York's Suffolk County and a CBS News law enforcement contributor, said some of the drops in violent crime could be attributed to criminals shifting their efforts to online crimes like identity theft.",
      "\"If they don't have to go out on the street and run drugs and can make money sitting at the computer, some criminals will do that, which presents a new challenge to police,\" Harrison told CBS News.",
      "Property crime also down",
      "Property crime also saw a considerable decrease of 8.1% in 2024, the FBI report found, following a 2.4% drop in 2023.",
      "Of note, motor vehicle thefts decreased by 18.6% from 2023 to 2024 following several years of increases. It's the largest one-year drop ever recorded in that category, although the overall rate of car thefts is still higher than it was in 2019, according to Asher.",
      "Other subcategories of property crime include burglary, down 8.6%, and larceny-theft, down 5.5%.",
      "The overall property crime rate in 2024 was the lowest recorded since 1961, according to the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "Hate crimes",
      "The FBI also included data on hate crimes, based on reports from 16,419 law enforcement agencies. In 2024, those departments reported 11,679 criminal incidents and 13,683 related offenses motivated by bias based on race, ethnicity, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation, disability, gender or gender identity.",
      "The overall number of such incidents decreased slightly in 2024 compared to 2023, although the FBI noted there can be fluctuations when looking at different groups.",
      "While the FBI report did not give a breakdown of the targets of hate crimes, CBS News has been tracking an increase in reported antisemitic hate crimes in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack in Israel and the subsequent Israeli military operation in Gaza. Anti-Muslim hate crimes have also been on the rise in the same time period.",
      "The Secure Community Network, which helps to track antisemitic incidents across the country, said roughly 69% of the reported religiously motivated incidents in 2024 were antisemitic, targeting Jewish people or institutions.",
      "Downward trend continuing",
      "While the FBI's report is focused on 2024, statistics for the current year are available and show a continuing downward trend, according to analysis from the Council on Criminal Justice.",
      "The homicide rate continued to decline in the first half of 2025, lowering the rate in the U.S. to a level it hasn't seen in a decade, the CCJ said. Although the group noted that while the overall numbers are going down, many cities are still seeing higher homicide rates than they did in the first half of 2019.",
      "\"These numbers are promising but not surprising,\" Ernesto Lopez, senior research specialist at the CCJ, told CBS News. \"After significant increases in violent crime starting in 2020, the decline in all major crime types across all sizes of jurisdictions is promising. These trends are closely aligned with our own findings, which show crime falling last year and continuing to fall in the first six months of 2025.\"",
      "The council also noted the limitations of the FBI's data, which doesn't cover the entire U.S. population and only measures crimes that are reported to law enforcement. Advocates for victims of sexual assault, for example, often note that many rapes go unreported.",
      "\"The police data is critical, but it's also important to remember that most crimes are not reported to police, so the overall volume is much higher than what's represented here,\" the CCJ told CBS News.",

    "summary": "Border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's ban on asylum claims, lifting a sweeping policy that had effectively closed the U.S. asylum system to many migrants, two officials told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's ban on asylum claims, following a federal court order that said the measure could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum-seekers, two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News.",
      "The move effectively lifts a sweeping policy that had closed the American asylum system to those entering the U.S. illegally or without proper documents. It's a measure the second Trump administration has credited for a steep drop in illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, where officials last month reported the lowest monthly level of migrant apprehensions on record.",
      "Mr. Trump's asylum crackdown was unprecedented in scope. The proclamation underpinning it, issued just hours after he returned to the White House in January, gave U.S. border officials the power to summarily deport migrants without allowing them to request asylum, a right enshrined in American law for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump said the extraordinary action was necessary due to what he called an \"invasion\" of migrants under the Biden administration, which faced record levels of illegal crossings at the southern border until it too restricted asylum last year.",
      "On Friday, a federal appeals court lifted its pause on a lower judge's ruling that found Mr. Trump's decree violated U.S. asylum laws. While the appellate court narrowed the lower court's order, saying Mr. Trump's proclamation could be used to pause access to the asylum system, it also ruled the U.S. government could not disregard other laws that bar officials from deporting migrants to places where they could be tortured or persecuted.",
      "Those laws require the U.S. to grant legal protections \u2014 known as \"withholding of removal\" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture \u2014 to migrants who prove they would likely face persecution or torture if deported to their home countries. Unlike asylum, those protections do not allow recipients to get permanent U.S. residency or protect them from being deported to a third party country.",
      "Officials at Customs and Border Protection were instructed this weekend to halt deportations under Mr. Trump's proclamation and to process migrants under U.S. immigration law, which affords foreigners on American soil the right to request humanitarian refuge, the two DHS officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss an internal directive.",
      "CBP officials received instructions to process migrants through different mechanisms, including through a fast-track deportation procedure known as expedited removal, according to the DHS officials. While expedited removal allows for relatively quick deportations, migrants processed under the policy are also allowed to apply for asylum if they convince officials that their fears of being harmed if deported are credible.",
      "For months, U.S. border agents had been using Mr. Trump's asylum ban to swiftly deport those crossing into the country illegally to Mexico, their home countries and, in some cases, third party nations that had agreed to accept them. Internally, officials have dubbed those deportations \"212(f) repatriations,\" in reference to the legal authority Mr. Trump invoked in his proclamation.",
      "While the lifting of Mr. Trump's order may reopen the U.S. asylum system, those caught crossing the southern border illegally will likely remain detained while officials vet their claims. The Trump administration has largely stopped the practice of releasing migrants into the U.S. while they await their court dates, limiting releases to cases involving extraordinary circumstances.",
      "The Justice Department could also try to get Friday's court order suspended by the Supreme Court, in a bid to revive Mr. Trump's asylum ban.",
      "In a statement to CBS News late Monday, CBP said Friday's court order affirmed \"the President's authority to deny asylum to aliens participating in an invasion into the United States.\"",
      "CBP said the Trump administration is \"committed to ensuring that aliens illegally entering the United States face consequences for their criminal actions.\"",
      "\"This includes prosecution to the fullest extent of the law and rapid removal from the United States,\" the agency added. \"CBP will continue to process illegal/inadmissible aliens consistent with law, including mandatory detention and expedited removal.\"",
      "After soaring to record levels in late 2023, illegal border crossings dropped sharply in former President Biden's last year office, following increased efforts by Mexico to interdict U.S.-bound migrants and an order issued by Biden in June 2024 to restrict access to the American asylum system. But they have plunged even further since Mr. Trump took office for a second time.",
      "In July, Border Patrol encountered just 4,600 migrants along the southern border, the lowest monthly tally ever publicly reported by the agency. It's also a figure the Biden administration recorded in 24 hours on many days.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 19:57:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A CBS News review of three of DOGE's largest cuts claimed so far found actual savings of 3% of what was claimed.",
    "story": [
      "The spotlight may have moved off the Department of Government Efficiency since the departure of Elon Musk, but the Trump administration's DOGE continues to post about cost cutting on its so-called \"wall of receipts.\" And once again, some of its claims about savings appear to be significantly overstated, according to a CBS News review.",
      "The review of three of the largest cuts claimed so far indicates the savings from those contracts are less than 3% of what DOGE said they were.",
      "On July 27, DOGE added 705 canceled contracts to the website it uses to track and declare savings from the agency's cost cutting across the federal government, among them three of the largest claimed cuts posted since President Trump launched DOGE in January.",
      "The three contracts \u2014 all from the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 funded COVID-19 testing and treatment for people who were uninsured or underinsured during the pandemic. DOGE claims canceling those contracts saved $6.4 billion.",
      "But CBS News' review of transaction records indicates the actual savings is just a small fraction of that \u2014 around $165 million.",
      "That's about how much in obligated funds were left unspent in the three contracts by the time Mr. Trump took office and DOGE was launched. There was nearly $7 billion that remained, but this figure represented a ceiling that federal contracting experts say is rarely reached.",
      "DOGE adjusted down that total potential value by a combined $6.4 billion \u2014 and then reported it as savings. But with the pandemic long over and the contracts set to expire on May 31 of this year, it is highly unlikely the contractors, which included Walgreens and CVS, would have spent anywhere near that sum on COVID-19 testing and treatment.",
      "The spending \"was never going to reach this number,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, referring to the total potential value. \"You didn't have to terminate this contract, you are the government \u2014 just don't obligate any more money.\"",
      "Since it was launched, multiple news outlets including CBS News have reported that DOGE's \"Wall of Receipts\" has at times vastly overstated the amount of funds cut and discovered numerous errors in the group's accounting.",
      "DOGE now claims it has saved $52.2 billion \u2013 just from contracts canceled. Malkus, who analyzed the actual implications of the cancellations rather than the ceiling values, puts the number closer to $17.8 billion. But that would only be if Congress agreed to rescind the funds that it had already voted to spend.",
      "The DOGE website reports a grand total of $199 \u202fbillion saved, when factoring in real estate lease cancellations and other cuts such as personnel reductions. However, it provides no documentation for roughly half of that amount. According to DOGE, the savings equate to $1,236.02 per person in the U.S.",
      "\"The amount they have per person is fiction,\" Malkus said. \"It's transparency theater.\"",
      "HHS did not respond to a CBS News request for comment about the three contracts. The White House redirected the request to the General Services Administration, which declined to comment.",
      "A substantial portion of those purported savings is a result of cuts to USAID. A recent study in the medical journal The Lancet says those cuts could come with a human toll. By the study's estimates, the loss in humanitarian aid could lead to 14 million deaths in children younger than 5 years of age by 2030.",
      "Malkus told CBS News, \"Their claims are generally to say, 'Hey this is a lot of pain, but it's worth it.'\"",
      "The update is only the second since Musk, who launched DOGE, departed from his role in the White House advising Mr. Trump.",
      "Shortly before Musk's term as a special government employee expired, he told reporters, \"This is not the end of DOGE, but really the beginning.\"",
      "\"The DOGE team will only grow stronger over time. The DOGE influence will only grow stronger,\" he said from the Oval Office on May 30, adding that he was confident over time DOGE would cull $1 trillion in savings.",
      "It's unclear exactly how DOGE has functioned since then. In late June, The Washington Post reported that federal officials were instructed to stop routing the grant-making process through DOGE, revoking control of the online clearinghouse for all grant opportunities from the group. In DOGE's latest update, only one additional canceled grant was added.",
      "Several DOGE-associated government employees have left in recent weeks, including the Department of the Interior's Tyler Hassen, whose last day was Friday, The New York Times reported. Hassen was originally hired as a DOGE staffer, and then was later tasked with trimming costs at the Interior Department, where he was named principal deputy assistant secretary of the interior.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum had allowed him broad authority to make cuts to budgets and staffing, and under his watch, a DOGE-associated employee made the claim that a single survey costing $1 billion dollars\u00a0had been cut. That claim was repeated by Elon Musk and Burgum, but no evidence was ever supplied to back it up.",

      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan on Tuesday met for a third time with President Trump since he took office, relying on her cordial relationship with him to express concern over the impact of tariffs on her state and to ask for a delay in changes to the Medicaid program.",
      "During the meeting, Whitmer asked Mr. Trump for a three-year transition period for changes to the state's Medicaid program in order to develop a \"new, federally compliant structure\" that limits the disruption in care for seniors, people with disabilities and new moms, according to the governor's office.",
      "She also stressed the negative impact of the president's tariff agenda on Michigan's automobile industry, which is particularly vulnerable to extra levies on imports from Mexico and Canada.",
      "The governor's office said Whitmer has encouraged the president to work with her on developing an advanced manufacturing site in Genesee County to create American auto jobs.",
      "The meeting between the governor and Mr. Trump took place as other Democratic governors, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Kathy Hochul of New York, are sheltering Texas Democrats during a showdown with the Lone Star state's GOP-led Legislature over a major redistricting overhaul. The redrawn districts would award five new Republican-leaning seats to Texans in an effort to insulate them from potential losses in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Whitmer has defended her relationship with the White House, arguing bipartisanship has enabled her to secure more investments for Michigan.",
      "\"I've always said that I'll work with anyone to get things done for Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a statement. \"This year alone, we've secured major, bipartisan wins including a new fighter mission at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Macomb County, funding to protect our Great Lakes from invasive carp, and federal disaster support for communities in Northern Michigan impacted by historic ice storms.\"",
      "A White House official says Whitmer is a\" bipartisan governor who wants to get things done.\"",
      "Whitmer last met with the president in early April, where she hid her face from photographers behind a folder in a now viral post. She later said she had been ushered into the Oval Office as Mr. Trump was speaking with reporters and signing executive orders \"that I did not agree with\" and using \"rhetoric with which I vehemently disagree.\"",
      "Later that month, she attended an event at Selfridge Air National Guard Base with the president on his 100th day in office where she hugged him on the tarmac. He was there to announce a fleet of new F-15EX Eagle II fighter jets would be based there.",
      "\"This will keep Selfridge at the cutting edge of North American air power,\" Mr. Trump said that day, in a big win for the base \u2014 and for Whitmer.",

      "A Department of Justice spokesperson and attorneys for Rodriguez did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Rodriguez is already charged with two counts of first-degree murder, murder of foreign officials and other counts for the shooting that killed Yaron Lischinsky, 30, and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, 26, two employees at the Israeli Embassy in Washington who were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum on May 21.",
      "He is also charged with causing the death of a person through the use of a firearm and discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro said at the time of the shooting that the attack was being investigated as a hate crime and terrorism.",
      "President Trump has sought to expand the use of the death penalty, directing his Justice Department to seek capital punishment \"for all crimes of a severity demanding its use\" in a January executive order. Under federal law, the death penalty is only permitted for certain crimes like homicide or treason, and some aggravating factor \u2014 like murdering a diplomat or kidnapping resulting in murder \u2014 must be present.",
      "According to charging documents, video shows that after Rodriguez allegedly shot the couple, he walked closer to them and fired \"several more times.\" Milgrim sat up after being shot, and he reloaded his weapon and fired again at her, striking her, the documents allege.",
      "In all, 21 rounds were fired from a 9 mm weapon, according to the court documents. A firearm magazine was found at the scene, and a handgun with its slide locked was found nearby.",
      "Federal officials traced the weapon and say records show it was purchased by Rodriguez on March 6, 2020, in Illinois. The handgun was purchased legally, according to a person briefed on the investigation.",
      "Once officers arrived at the museum, Rodriguez asked to speak with police and told them, \"I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza, I am unarmed,\" according to the charging documents. Rodriguez was then taken into custody.",
      "FBI Washington Assistant Director Steven Jensen said the suspect, who lived in Chicago, came to Washington, D.C., on May 20 and was traveling for a work conference. He flew from Chicago O'Hare Airport to Reagan National Airport with the firearm in checked luggage and had declared the firearm, according to court documents.",

      "\"I think based upon comments made by legislators themselves, they face a possibility of facing bribery charges, which is a second-degree felony in the state of Texas, there's one way to cure that, and that is if they get back to the state of Texas and make quorum today at a hearing that we have at 3 o'clock, they can cure themselves of any quid pro quo that would subject them to potential bribery charges,\" Abbott said.",
      "But Jones noted that \"Texas, compared to other states, has very loose ethics laws.\"",
      "\"The governor is certainly welcome to make that argument, and theoretically it has a limited level of potential to move forward, but at the end of the day, if you look at Texas ethics law and look at all of the things that are allowed under Texas ethics law \u2026 we would rank receiving money to pay a fine at the lower end at the potential for an ethics violation, let alone things that are illegal,\" Jones said.",
      "Cornyn also noted the bribery claims in his letter to the FBI, writing that he is \"concerned that legislators who solicited or accepted funds to aid in their efforts to avoid their legislative duties may be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses.\"",
      "Abbott said Sunday that if members didn't return by 3 p.m. CT Monday, he'd \"invoke Texas Attorney General Opinion No. KP-0382 to remove the missing Democrats from membership in the Texas House.\"",
      "Abbott was citing a 2021 opinion from Texas' Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, which was written after a previous walkout when Democratic lawmakers left the state to protest a change in the voting laws. The opinion, which is nonbinding, says a \"district court may determine that a legislator has forfeited his or her office due to abandonment and can remove the legislator from office, thereby creating a vacancy.\"",
      "But Jones noted that the only legal ways to remove a Texas lawmaker is either for the person to be expelled by a vote of two-thirds of the Legislature \u2014 which happened when legislators voted to expel\u00a0Republican Rep. Byron Slaton\u00a0over misconduct in 2023 \u2014 or by voters at the ballot box.",
      "Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain\u00a0posted on social media\u00a0Monday that he would file a bill to declare a seat vacant if a legislator missed seven consecutive days of a session. But since there is no quorum, that bill can't receive a vote \u2014 at least for now.",
      "Why did Texas Democrats flee the state?",
      "Abbott called a special session last month to take up the redistricting effort, along with 17 other issues, including relief for Texas flood victims, a review of the flood warning system and emergency preparedness, and a THC ban. Congressional redistricting, however, was to be considered first.",
      "Texas has a part-time legislature which meets for 140 days every other year. The governor has the right to call a 30-day special session to address certain topics. The current special session started on July 21.",
      "Abbott can call as many special sessions as he wants, which means that if Democrats run out the clock on this special session, he could call another one as soon as it ends. After the 2023 legislative session, for example, Abbott called four special sessions, which kept lawmakers in Austin into December. He convened the first one only hours after the legislative session ended.",

    "summary": "The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas to Bill and Hillary Clinton and former Justice Department officials for testimony about Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas Tuesday to a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton, for testimony about the case involving convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The subpoenas seeking depositions from the former Justice Department officials were issued after Republicans and Democrats on a House Oversight subcommittee approved measures to authorize the demands last month as part of efforts by Congress to obtain more information about Epstein.",
      "House investigators also issued a subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for documents related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, his associate who is serving a 20-year prison sentence. The department confirmed it received the subpoena but did not comment further.",
      "The committee is seeking testimony from Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as from officials spanning the past four presidential administrations: former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Bill Barr, Alberto Gonzales, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch and Eric Holder, and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller. Sessions and Barr led the Justice Department during President Trump's first term. Lawmakers are seeking information from the Clintons because of the former president's past ties to Epstein and Maxwell in the early 2000s.",
      "Letters to the officials from Kentucky Rep. James Comer, a Republican who leads the Oversight Committee, are all similar. The records from the Justice Department must be turned over by Aug. 19, according to the Oversight committee, and depositions are scheduled for throughout August, September and October.",
      "\"While the Department undertakes efforts to uncover and publicly disclose additional information related to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell's cases, it is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell,\" Comer wrote, adding that the Oversight panel \"may use the results of this investigation to inform legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Clinton said in 2019 after Epstein was indicted on federal charges that the former president took four trips on Epstein's plane in 2002 and 2003, traveling to Europe, Asia and Africa. Angel Ure\u00f1a, the spokesperson, said the trips included stops in connection with the Clinton Foundation, and staff, foundation supporters, and Clinton's Secret Service detail were on every leg of every trip. Clinton also had a meeting with Epstein in 2002 and made \"one brief visit\" to Epstein's apartment with a staff member and his secretary detail, Ure\u00f1a said.",
      "\"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago or those with which he has been recently charged in New York,\" he said, adding that Clinton hadn't spoken to Epstein in more than a decade and had never been to his island, New Mexico ranch or Florida residence.",
      "Former presidents have not successfully been compelled to testify before Congress, but several have voluntarily answered questions from committees, including Presidents Gerald Ford in 1983, Harry Truman in 1955 and William Howard Taft on numerous occasions,\u00a0according to the Senate.",
      "Epstein was charged with federal sex trafficking crimes in 2019 and died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial. He had been investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, though that ended in a federal non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges in 2008.",
      "But Congress has renewed its focus on Epstein after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo\u00a0last month that concluded Epstein did not have a \"client list\" of prominent figures and confirmed he died by suicide. The memo also found that there was no \"credible evidence\" that the disgraced financier blackmailed prominent people. The Justice Department and FBI said they did not plan to release any further information about Epstein's case.",
      "The findings rankled some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who are skeptical that there is nothing else regarding Epstein's case to make public. Amid the backlash, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell late last month for two days in Tallahassee, where she was serving her sentence before being moved to a minimum-security facility in Texas last week.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. An appeal of her conviction is currently awaiting action from the Supreme Court. The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Maxwell\u00a0for testimony last month and set a deposition for Aug. 11. But Comer offered to delay the interview while the Supreme Court considers whether to take up her case. The justices are set to weigh her petition at a closed-door conference Sept. 29, but do not have to act on it immediately.",
      "Comer said the committee will \"engage in good faith negotiations\" around the deposition, but would not grant her congressional immunity or send her its questions in advance \u2014 two requests by Maxwell's attorney.",
      "Blanche and Bondi have also asked federal judges in New York to unseal transcripts from the grand jury proceedings in Epstein and Maxwell's cases, though federal rules typically require matters before grand juries to be kept secret.",
      "Beyond the moves by the Justice Department, lawmakers have pushed for files related to Epstein to be released to the public. A clash of House members over the material led the House to scrap votes and leave Washington early for its monthlong summer recess.",
      "House Republicans put forth a non-binding resolution last month to make the files from the federal probe into Epstein public, but Speaker Mike Johnson said the lower chamber would not vote on it until September, when lawmakers return from their break.",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                      Ellis  Kim and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 15:09:29 -0400",
    "summary": "The State Department said in a notice that it is launching a \"visa bond pilot program\" that aims to curb overstays for visitors who come to the U.S. for business or tourism.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The State Department is set to roll out a pilot program that may require foreign nationals from certain countries seeking business or tourism visas to post a bond of up to $15,000, according to a public notice set to be published Tuesday.",
      "The notice lays out the details of a 12-month \"visa bond pilot program\" that would allow consular officers to require visa bonds. Under the program, the bonds may be required for travelers from countries that the State Department says have high rates of visa overstays, or where screening and vetting information is considered deficient, according to the document.",
      "The notice does not specify the countries covered by the pilot program, but said the State Department will announce the list at least 15 days before it takes effect. The agency will also provide an explanation of why the bonds are required, according to the listing, which will be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday.",
      "The program will take effect 15 days after the notice is officially published and will run through August 2026, the document states.",
      "The program comes in response to an executive order issued by President Trump on the first day of his second term that sought to stem illegal immigration into the U.S., a major focus of the president's policy agenda. The measure directed the treasury secretary, along with the secretaries of state and homeland security, to take action to implement a visa bond program.",
      "As part of his immigration agenda, the president has sought to roll back humanitarian programs for migrants from certain countries, and signed a proclamation in June banning foreign nationals from a dozen countries from traveling to the U.S. The Trump administration has also targeted immigrants on student visas and taken steps to tighten the rules for visa applicants.",
      "A new tax-and-spending bill signed by Mr. Trump last month also subjects many travelers to the U.S. to a $250 \"visa integrity fee.\"",
      "Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, said the latest measures from the Trump administration will deter travel to the U.S. from foreign countries.",
      "\"Bonds on tourist and business visas will convince most foreigners not to bother coming,\" Nowrasteh said in a statement to CBS News. \"The result will be a decimated tourist industry. Tourists spend over $200 billion annually in the U.S., spending that counts as exports. The administration's proposal will not only undermine much of the tourist industry, but it will counteract the administration's goals to reduce the trade deficit. The Trump administration's talent is proposing and enacting the most punitive, expensive, and unnecessary migration restrictions imaginable.\"",
      "The State Department described the pilot program as a \"tool of diplomacy\" and said it will help inform future decisions regarding the potential use of visa bonds \"to address the national security and foreign policy priorities\" raised in Mr. Trump's executive order.",
      "\"The Pilot Program is further designed to serve as a diplomatic tool to encourage foreign governments to take all appropriate actions to ensure robust screening and vetting for all citizens in matters of identity verification and public safety, to create safeguards in [Citizenship by Investment] programs that provide citizenship without any residency in the country, and to encourage specified countries with visa overstays to ensure their nationals timely depart the United States after making temporary visits,\" according to the notice.",
      "Who may be included in the visa bond pilot program?",
      "The State Department did not say which countries with high overstay rates would trigger the visa bond requirement. But an August 2024 report from the Department of Homeland Security found that in fiscal year 2023, there were more than 300,000 foreign nationals admitted for business or pleasure who were still in the U.S. after their authorized stay ended.",
      "The pilot program will focus on countries that have high visa overstay rates among those allowed into the U.S. for business or pleasure \u2014 through B-1 or B-2 visas, according to the notice. A B-1 visa is for those temporarily traveling to the U.S. for business activities. A B-2 visa is for foreign nationals who want to come to the U.S. temporarily for tourism or pleasure.",
      "Travelers entering the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program will not have to post a bond, according to the State Department's notice. That program allows residents of more than 40 countries to enter the U.S. for fewer than 90 days without a visa.",
      "While the countries subject to the program will be announced in the future, the list may also be modified on a rolling basis, the State Department said. The countries with the highest overstay rates for people with business and tourism visas in fiscal year 2023 were Chad, Laos, Haiti and Congo, according to the Department of Homeland Security's report.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Tuesday that beginning Aug. 20, travelers from Malawi and Zambia seeking business and tourist visas will have to post a bond of up to $15,000.",
      "\"This targeted, common-sense measure reinforces the administration's commitment to U.S. immigration law while deterring visa overstays,\" she said.",
      "Only foreign nationals who are applying for B-1 or B-2 nonimmigrant visas, and who are from the countries identified by the State Department, may be required to post a bond of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 as a condition of receiving a visa. The bond can be canceled if the person meets certain criteria, including leaving the U.S. by the date their authorization expires, according to the terms of the program detailed in the notice.",
      "The new requirement for certain foreign nationals seeking to come to the U.S. for business or tourism could have negative consequences for cities that rely on travelers from abroad. A June report from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority found that Sin City experienced an 11% drop in visitation year-over-year, hosting nearly 3.5 million visitors in June 2024 and nearly 3.1 million this June.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Travel Association said the pilot program appears to effect roughly 2,000 applicants, most likely from a few countries with low travel volume to the U.S. But the group is more concerned with the $250 \"Visa Integrity Fee\" included in the tax-and-spending plan, the spokesperson said.",
      "\"If this fee is implemented, the U.S. will have one of, if not the highest, visitor visa fees in the world,\" the spokesperson said. \"If we are to maintain a competitive position in the global travel market, it's critical that U.S. visa policy reflects both national security priorities and the significant economic value of international visitation.\"",
      "David Bier, the Cato Institute's director of immigration studies, called the bond requirement \"draconian.\"",
      "\"Although we can't know for certain the scale of this rule because the administration isn't saying which countries it will apply to, the rule will add what is likely an insurmountable barrier to travel for many applicants who end up being targeted who are often family members of U.S. citizens,\" he said in a statement. \"Its argument that this will pressure governments to somehow force their visa holders to comply with the terms of their visas is incoherent, and it appears to be an admission that it will likely just ban people from coming, not just result in compliance. Most visa overstays leave after some time or end up qualifying for legal status in the United States another way. There is no reason to impose such a draconian rule.\"",

But multiple agencies told workers to ignore the request from the start, and OPM told agency heads to use their discretion when determining how they would handle the directive.

      "Following the dramatic video of an American Airlines flight evacuating on a Denver runway last month, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois is sending a letter to new FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford demanding answers on evacuation safety.",
      "\"The FAA needs an evacuation standard that reflects the reality of flying today,\" Duckworth told CBS News in a statement. \"The American people deserve to know whether the FAA is taking this responsibility seriously and complying with the law to ensure the flying public can be safely evacuated from an aircraft during an emergency.\"",
      "Duckworth, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Aviation Subcommittee, is concerned about the ability to evacuate an airliner in 90 seconds or less.",
      "\"Video showed passengers exiting with carry-on bags and, according to at least one passenger, the process took 10 to 15 minutes \u2014 the latter estimate exceeding FAA's 90 second evacuation standard by 10 times,\" she wrote in her letter to Bedford.",
      "The senator is seeking details about three recent evacuations.",
      "The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are currently investigating after American Airlines Flight 3023, traveling from Denver to Miami, experienced a landing gear issue during takeoff with 173 passengers and six crew members on board. The Boeing 737 Max 8 was going nearly 150 mph when the pilots slammed on the brakes. As passengers used emergency exit slides to evacuate, flames could be seen coming from the landing gear on July 26.",
      "\"We heard a loud boom, and I said 'That's not good,'\" passenger Mark Tsurkis recounted. \"Most of the people evacuated safely, except a few people who decided to take their luggage with them and that kind of, you know, that endangered others and endangered them.\"",
      "In April, a Delta A330 in Orlando experienced an engine fire, prompting passengers to evacuate. Kyle Becker, who was sitting in row 35, said he opened the window as soon as he heard people yell \"fire!\"",
      "\"There was a fire on the engine,\" Becker told CBS News at the time. \"[It] was a little scary\u2026 just never had happened to me before. Start thinking, like, OK, what are the next steps. Trying to remain calm.\"",
      "This incident also prompted an FAA investigation.",
      "And in March, another American Airlines Boeing 737 experienced a fire stemming from an engine issue while it was parked at a gate at Denver International Airport. Passengers filled the wing of the plane trying to escape the smoke.",
      "\"Everyone was screaming, 'There's a fire. There's a fire,'\" Helen Prager, who was on the plane, recalled. \"Literally at the gate and I was screaming, 'Get the doors open.'\"",
      "The FAA and NTSB are looking into the fire.",
      "\"While FAA has yet to disclose how long any of the referenced passenger evacuations took, these incidents once again raise serious questions about FAA's 90 second evacuation standard as well as FAA's assumptions about how evacuations occur in real world conditions (such as the assumption every passenger will comply with instructions to deplane without carry-on bags),\" Duckworth wrote in her letter.",
      "She wants the FAA to disclose how long the evacuations took and how many passengers took their bags with them, as well as how many children, seniors and passengers with disabilities were on board each of the flights.",
      "The senator is also seeking an update on evacuation testing that Congress mandated the FAA complete within one year of the FAA's reauthorization bill passing. That deadline passed in May. The updated testing was to replace a series of tests the FAA conducted in 2019 that did not include any real-world scenarios such as luggage in the cabin and passengers who were children, seniors or not able-bodied.",
      "Last year, Duckworth told CBS News she did not believe she could get off a plane during an emergency in under 90 seconds.",
      "\"Not at all confident, not at all confident. I often fly where I'm not wearing both my artificial legs,\" said Duckworth, who lost both of her legs while serving in the Iraq War. \"I don't think it's realistic anymore. \u2026 Conduct a real test and let's see what the realistic standard is.\"",
      "Duckworth asked the FAA to respond to her letter by Aug. 12.",
      "\"We need answers. Are the current [plane] evacuation standards, are they adequate?\" former NTSB chair and CBS News transportation safety analyst Robert Sumwalt said. \"It's definitely time for the FAA to go back and reassess what standards they're using for evacuations. It's been almost 35 years since those standards were published.\"",
      "The FAA told CBS News it will respond directly to Duckworth.",
      "\"Safety is our top priority,\" the FAA said. \"That's why the FAA's message to passengers is simple: if you have to evacuate, leave your bags behind and follow crew instructions.\"",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford addressed the American Airlines incident in late July.",
      "\"We were all disappointed that many of the passengers on board did not respond to the flight attendant's request to evacuate timely,\" he said at a news conference. \"Grabbing bags, that's just wrong.\"",
      "\"We can't have somebody at the front of the line grabbing their overhead bags and keeping people in the back of the airplane from being able to safely evacuate, so we will be doing some education, to make sure that it's clear that passengers on board not only have an obligation, but it's the right thing to do for everybody on board is to listen to the flight attendants and obey their their instructions,\" he said.",

      "Little Rock, Ark. \u2014 A new Arkansas law requiring public classrooms to display the Ten Commandments cannot be enforced in a handful of the state's largest school districts where parents brought challenges on the grounds that it violates the separation of church and state, a federal judge ruled Monday.",
      "But the ruling by U.S. District Judge Timothy L. Brooks, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, only narrowly applied to four of the state's 237 districts. That left the impact of the decision limited as thousands of Arkansas students prepared to return to class this month.",
      "The injunction is the latest legal turn in a widening push in Republican-led states to give religion a bigger presence in public schools.",
      "Texas and Louisiana have passed similar laws requiring classrooms to display the Ten Commandments and the issue is expected to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"Why would Arkansas pass an obviously unconstitutional law?\" Brooks wrote in his 35-page ruling. \"Most likely because the state is part of a coordinated strategy among several states to inject Christian religious doctrine into public-school classrooms.\"",
      "The Arkansas law, signed earlier this year by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, takes effect Tuesday and requires the Ten Commandments to be prominently displayed in public school classrooms and libraries.",
      "The suit was filed on behalf of the families by the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion Foundation.",
      "\"The court saw through this attempt to impose religious doctrine in public schools and upheld every student's right to learn free from government-imposed faith,\" John L. Williams, legal director of ACLU of Arkansas said in a statement. \"We're proud to stand with our clients \u2014 families of many different backgrounds \u2014 who simply want their kids to get an education.\"",
      "Attorney General Tim Griffin, whose office defended the law, said he was reviewing the decision and assessing legal options.",
      "The lawsuit says the requirement violates the families' constitutional rights and pressures students into observing a religion favored by the state.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if the groups would seek an broader block of the law beyond the four districts. ACLU of Arkansas Executive Director Holly Bailey said through a spokesperson that \"it is clear from this order and long established law that all should refrain from posting\" the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms.",
      "The similar requirements enacted in Texas and Louisiana are also being challenged in court.",
      "A group of families and faith leaders filed a lawsuit seeking to block Texas' requirements days after it was signed into law.",
      "Last month in Louisiana \u2014 the first state that mandated the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms \u2014 a panel of three appellate judges ruled that the law was unconstitutional.",
      "The ruling marked a major win for civil liberties groups who say the law violates the separation of church and state. But the legal battle is likely far from over.",
      "Many, including Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, expect the case to eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court. Most recently, Murrill filed a petition seeking the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit's review in the matter.",

    "story": [
      "Sao Paulo \u2014 A justice on Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest Monday of former President Jair Bolsonaro, on trial for allegedly masterminding a coup plot to remain in office despite his defeat in the 2022 election \u2014 a case that has gripped the South American country as it faces a trade war with the Trump administration.",
      "Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees the case against Bolsonaro before the top court, said in his decision that the 70-year-old former president had violated precautionary measures imposed on him by spreading content through his three lawmaker sons.",
      "Bolsonaro's lawyers said in a statement that he will appeal the decision. They said his words \"good afternoon, Copacabana, good afternoon my Brazil, a hug to everyone, this is for our freedom\" \u2014 broadcast from a cell phone of one of his sons during a Sunday protest in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 cannot \"be regarded as ignoring precautionary measures or as a criminal act.\"",
      "The trial of the far-right leader is receiving renewed attention after\u00a0President Trump directly tied a 50% tariff on imported Brazilian goods to his ally's judicial situation. Mr. Trump has called the proceedings a \"witch hunt,\" triggering nationalist reactions from leaders of all branches of power in Brazil, including President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "Hours after the decision, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on X that the Trump administration \"condemns (de) Moraes' order imposing house arrest on Bolsonaro and will hold accountable all those aiding and abetting sanctioned conduct.\"",
      "\"Putting even more restrictions on Jair Bolsonaro's ability to defend himself in public is not a public service. Let Bolsonaro speak!\" the post said.",
      "Brazil's government hasn't commented on the case.",
      "Brazil's prosecutors accuse Bolsonaro of heading a criminal organization that plotted to overturn the election, including plans to kill Lula and Justice de Moraes after the far-right leader narrowly lost his reelection bid in 2022.",
      "Monday's order followed one from the top court last month that ordered Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor and imposed a curfew on his activities while the proceedings are underway.",
      "Following news of the arrest order, a staffer with Brazil's federal police told The Associated Press federal agents had seized cell phones at Bolsonaro's residence in the capital of Brasilia, as ordered by de Moraes in his decision. The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity due to their lack of authorization to speak about the matter publicly.",
      "De Moraes also warned that any new transgression would lead to him being detained, French news agency AFP reports.",
      "Bolsonaro is expected to remain in Brasilia for his house arrest as he isn't allowed to travel. He also has a house in Rio de Janeiro, where he held his electoral base as a lawmaker for three decades. The former army captain is the fourth former president of Brazil to be arrested since the end of the country's military rule from 1964 to 1985, which Bolsonaro supported.",
      "The move from the Brazilian justice comes a day after tens of thousands of Bolsonaro supporters took the streets in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio, pleading for Brazil's congress to pardon him and hundreds of others who are either under trial or jailed for their roles in the destruction of government buildings in Brasilia on Jan. 8, 2023.",
      "On Sunday, Bolsonaro addressed supporters in Rio through the phone of one of his sons, which de Moraes' described as illegal.",
      "\"The flagrant disrespect to the precautionary measures was so obvious that the defendant's son, Sen. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, decided to remove the posting in his Instagram profile, with the objective of hiding the legal transgression,\" de Moraes wrote.",
      "Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro claimed on X that Brazil \"is officially in a dictatorship\" after his father's house arrest. \"The persecution of de Moraes against Bolsonaro has no limits!\" the senator wrote.",
      "De Moraes added in his ruling that Jair Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022, has spread messages with \"a clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary\" \u2014 likely a veiled reference to Mr. Trump's support for Bolsonaro.",
      "De Moraes also said Bolsonaro \"addressed protesters gathered in Copacabana, in Rio\" on Sunday so his supporters could \"try to coerce the Supreme Court.\"",
      "U.S. backs Bolsonaro, takes on de Moraes",
      "Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression regarding Bolsonaro's trial. On Monday, the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs called the Brazilian justice \"a U.S.-sanctioned human rights abuser\" and accused him of using \"institutions to silence opposition and threaten democracy.\"",
      "De Moraes said in his decision that \"(Brazil's) judiciary will not allow a defendant to make a fool out of it.\"",
      "\"Justice is the same for all. A defendant who willingly ignores precautionary measures \u2014 for the second time \u2014 must suffer legal consequences,\" he said.",
      "Political implications for Brazil",
      "Creomar de Souza, a political analyst of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, a political consultancy firm based in Brasilia, said Bolsonaro's house arrest opens a new moment for the country's opposition, which will could gather steam in fighting against Lula's reelection bid next year.",
      "Now, de Souza said, \"the 2026 election looks like turmoil\" and the political debate in Brazil will likely be split between two key struggles.",
      "\"One is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,\" the analyst said. \"The second is how the Lula administration will try to show that the country has a government.\"",
      "\"This is just the start,\" he concluded.",
      "The latest decision from the top court keeps Bolsonaro under ankle monitoring, allows only family members and lawyers to visit him and seizes all mobile phones from his home.",
      "Lula was imprisoned for 580 days between 2018 and 2019 in a corruption conviction that was later tossed out by the Supreme Court, citing the bias of the judge in the case.",
      "Michel Temer, who became president after Dilma Rousseff was impeached in 2016, was arrested for 10 days in 2019 in connection with a graft investigation, which later ended without a conviction.",
      "Earlier this year, de Moraes ordered the detention of President Fernando Collor, who was in office from 1990 to 1992 until he was impeached. The 75-year-old former president was convicted of money laundering and corruption in 2023 and is now serving his more than eight-year sentence.",
      "Hours after the order, right-wing lawmakers criticized de Moraes' decision and compared Bolsonaro's situation to that of his predecessors.",
      "\"House arrest for Jair Bolsonaro by de Moraes. Reason: corruption?\" asked lawmaker Nikolas Ferreira. \"No. His kids posted his content on social media. Pathetic.\"",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have at last solved the mystery of what killed more than 5 billion sea stars \u2014 often known as starfish \u2014 off the Pacific coast of North America in a decade-long epidemic.",
      "Starting in 2013, a mysterious sea star wasting disease sparked a mass die-off from Mexico to Alaska. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species and continues today. Worst hit was a species called the sunflower sea star, which lost around 90% of its population in the outbreak's first five years.",
      "\"It's really quite gruesome,\" said marine disease ecologist Alyssa Gehman at the Hakai Institute in British Columbia, Canada, who helped pinpoint the cause.",
      "Healthy sea stars have \"puffy arms sticking straight out,\" she said. But the wasting disease causes them to grow lesions and \"then their arms actually fall off.\"",
      "The culprit? Bacteria that has also infected shellfish, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.",
      "The findings \"solve a long-standing question about a very serious disease in the ocean,\" said Rebecca Vega Thurber, a marine microbiologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Sea stars typically have five arms and some species sport up to 24 arms. They range in color from solid orange to tapestries of orange, purple, brown and green.",
      "\"Symptoms of sea star wasting syndrome include abnormally twisted arms, white lesions, deflation of arms and body, arm loss, and body disintegration,\" the National Park Service says. \"They die over the course of days or weeks.\"",
      "It took more than a decade for researchers to identify the cause of the disease, with many false leads and twists and turns along the way.",
      "Early research hinted the cause might be a virus, but it turned out the densovirus that scientists initially focused on was actually a normal resident inside healthy sea stars and not associated with disease, said Melanie Prentice of the Hakai Institute, co-author of the new study.",
      "Other efforts missed the real killer because researchers studied tissue samples of dead sea stars that no longer contained the bodily fluid that surrounds the organs.",
      "But the latest study includes detailed analysis of this fluid, called coelomic fluid, where the bacteria Vibrio pectenicida were found.",
      "\"It's incredibly difficult to trace the source of so many environmental diseases, especially underwater,\" said microbiologist Blake Ushijima of the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, who was not involved in the research. He said the detective work by this team was \"really smart and significant.\"",
      "Now that scientists know the cause, they have a better shot at intervening to help sea stars. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the sunflower sea star as critically endangered.",
      "Prentice said that scientists could potentially now test which of the remaining sea stars are still healthy \u2014 and consider whether to relocate them, or breed them in captivity to later transplant them to areas that have lost almost all their sunflower sea stars.",
      "The study notes that Vibrio bacteria have been called \"the microbial barometer of climate change\" because the species are more prevalent in warming water temperatures. The authors say an important next phase of research will be to work on better understanding the relationship between rising seawater temperatures and sea star wasting disease.",
      "Scientists may also test if some populations have natural immunity, and if treatments like probiotics may help boost immunity to the disease.",
      "Such recovery work is not only important for sea stars, but for entire Pacific ecosystems because healthy starfish gobble up excess sea urchins, researchers say.",
      "Sunflower sea stars \"look sort of innocent when you see them, but they eat almost everything that lives on the bottom of the ocean,\" said Gehman. \"They're voracious eaters.\"",
      "With many fewer sea stars, the sea urchins that they usually munch on exploded in population \u2014 and in turn gobbled up around 95% of the kelp forest s in Northern California within a decade. These kelp forests provide food and habitat for a wide variety of animals including fish, sea otters and seals.",
      "Researchers hope the new findings will allow them to restore sea star populations \u2014 and regrow the kelp forests that Thurber compares to \"the rainforests of the ocean.\""

      "The flash \u2014 dubbed a \"megaflash,\" or a single continuous long horizontal flash that can initiate up to hundreds of cloud-to-ground strikes \u2014 happened on Oct. 22, 2017, according to a research report published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. While the storm that day had previously been analyzed by scientists, new satellite technology recently documented the megaflash exceeding 500 miles.",
      "The previous world record recognized by the World Meteorological Organization was a megaflash on April 29, 2020, extending 477 miles across the southern United States and the Gulf of Mexico, the researchers said.",
      "While the 2017 megaflash may be the longest in horizontal distance, it did not have the longest duration. Researchers estimated that it lasted just over 7 seconds. The current WMO-recognized record for longest duration megaflash occurred over Argentina and Uruguay in June 2020 and was about 17 seconds.",

      "\"We've finally solved the mystery of where potatoes came from,\" corresponding author Sanwen Huang of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences said in a news release.",
      "The origin of the modern potato has puzzled scientists for years. In terms of appearance, potatoes resemble a species from Chile called Etuberosum, with one crucial difference: Etuberosum don't produce the starch-rich tubers. That's where the tomato comes in.",
      "While tomatoes don't have tubers, the ancient tomato did provide a crucial gene that, when mixed with the genetics of Etuberosum, told the modern potato to form tubers, according to the researchers. The SP6A gene from the tomato parent tells the potato plant to make tubers, while the IT1 gene from Etuberosum assists in controlling the growth of the underground stems that form tubers. Both pieces were needed to create the potato that's known and loved today.",
      "\"Our findings show how a hybridization event between species can spark the evolution of new traits, allowing even more species to emerge,\" Huang said.",

Highlights included a spacewalk by McClain and Ayers and a non-stop schedule of research and station maintenance.",
      "\"I'm kind of looking forward to doing nothing for a couple of days,\" McClain joked when asked what she looked forward to the most about returning to Earth. Onishi said he was looking forward to seeing his family again, \"and also taking a hot shower on the ground!\"",

      "NASA plans to retire the space station in 2030, using a custom spacecraft being designed by SpaceX to drive the 930,000-pound football-field-size lab out of orbit, making sure it breaks up in the atmosphere over the southern Pacific Ocean, far from any populated areas.",
      "As one might expect of a decades old spacecraft of the size and complexity of the International Space Station, the vehicle is showing signs of wear and tear. One of the more concerning issues is a small-but-persistent leak in a compartment between the Russian Zvezda module and its aft docking port.",
      "The leak was discovered in 2019. The Russians believe its related to metal fatigue. NASA managers think it's more complicated than that. In any case, cosmonauts aboard the station have made multiple attempts to plug the leaks, but they have persisted.",
      "Earlier this summer, NASA held up the launch of the Axiom 4 flight to the space station due to indications a hatch used to seal off the leaking compartment was also leaking. They now have confirmed the hatch can, in fact, be sealed when needed to protect the integrity of the station's primary air supply.",
      "\"The rest of the station is leak tight,\" said Bill Spetch, NASA's ISS integration operations manager. \"We continuously monitor that, and everything else shows that we are really tight on our leak rate on the rest of ISS, no evidence of any other cracks or any other places.\"",

      "The fires that ravaged Los Angeles at the beginning of this year took 31 lives by the official count, but new research estimates there were hundreds more deaths that are attributable to the disaster.",
      "In the study, published in the medical journal JAMA on Wednesday, researchers analyzed data on the number of deaths in Los Angeles County from Jan. 5 to Feb. 1, 2025 \u2014 the period when the Palisades and Eaton fires tore though the city \u2014 and estimated that 440 more deaths could be attributed to the fires, compared to the expected number based on data from previous years.",
      "These additional deaths likely reflect a combination of factors, including increased exposure to\u00a0poor air quality, which may exacerbate heart or lung conditions, the authors say. They also point to the impact of delays or interruptions in people's access to necessary health care during that period.",
      "\"The findings from this study underscore the need to complement direct fatalities estimates with alternative methods to quantify the additional mortality burden of wildfires and of climate-related emergencies more broadly,\" the authors wrote. \"They also highlight the need for improved mortality surveillance during and after wildfire emergencies.\"",
      "The study did have some limitations, including some provisional data, and it did not account for deaths that may have occurred after Feb. 1.",

Among the more than 1,000 study participants, nearly 63% had high blood pressure, nearly 50% reported depressive symptoms and about 22% exhibited FEV, or \"forced expiratory volume,\" a measure of lung function.",

      "Using data from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics from January 2014 through December 2023, researchers found the fires were associated with a 46% increase in the suicide and overdose death rate in all of Hawaii in August 2023, relative to other months, and a 97% increase that month in Maui alone.",
      "During the 120-month study period, August 2023 accounted for both Maui's and other Hawaiian counties' highest monthly combined suicide and overdose death rate.",

    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets as homes stay on the market longer and new listings climb.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Miami exploded, he added. Part of the reason construction in those cities took off, Krimmel added, was that the laws in their respective state make it easier to build during big influxes in demand.",
      "\"[Builders] we're actually able to get things permitted, get shovels in the ground and get buildings built,\" Krimmel said.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says the federal government is calling off around $500 million worth of vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology.",
    "story": [
      "The federal government is calling off around $500 million worth of vaccine development projects that use mRNA technology, Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Tuesday.",
      "The 22 now-terminated projects were funded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA. Most of the projects that were canceled were for vaccines that fight COVID-19 or the flu, Kennedy\u00a0said.",
      "They include proposals from Pfizer, Sanofi Pasteur and other drugmakers that were rejected or canceled, along with a now-shuttered award to Moderna to develop a bird flu vaccine, according to an HHS statement. The projects were reviewed and canceled over the last few weeks, said Kennedy.",
      "A Moderna spokesperson told CBS News that the company's H5N1 (bird flu) contract was canceled in May, and it isn't aware of any new BARDA cancellations.",
      "Kennedy framed the move as part of a step away from research into mRNA vaccines. Those types of vaccines\u00a0use messenger RNA, or mRNA, to prompt the body to make proteins that induce antibody production to protect against an infection. The approach has drawn more interest since the COVID-19 pandemic, when mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna were\u00a0found to be safe and effective against the coronavirus. Public health officials credit the rapid development of the vaccines with saving millions of lives.",
      "Nevertheless, Kennedy said, \"HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses.\"",
      "He argued mRNA-based vaccines can stop working properly if the virus that they target mutates too much, citing\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0as an example. \"A single mutation can make mRNA vaccines ineffective,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Leading infections disease experts criticized the decision and said it will leave Americans vulnerable.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a virologist and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said Kennedy \"has once again made a decision, not based on scientific evidence that puts this country at unnecessary risk.\"",
      "Epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm called it \"one of the worst decisions I've seen in 50 years of public health preparedness work.\"",
      "\"If an influenza pandemic hit us tomorrow, the global flu vaccine manufacturing capacity using the standard method of growing the virus in chicken eggs would only produce enough vaccine in 18 months to vaccinate just one fourth of the world,\" he told CBS News. \"We desperately need a vaccine technology where we could make enough vaccine for the world in a year.\"",
      "Many experts say a major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that they can be developed, manufactured and changed quickly, allowing drugmakers and public health officials to respond rapidly to novel viruses and to constantly mutating viruses like the flu.",
      "In 2020, the first Trump administration funded the development of Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, which were developed significantly faster than traditional vaccines.",
      "\"No other nation matched what America achieved during the pandemic,\" Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, told CBS News. \"We pioneered and delivered life-saving mRNA vaccines at unprecedented speed. It's a historic accomplishment we should celebrate. Clinging to outdated technologies to counter a future flu pandemic is a grave mistake.\"",
      "Kennedy has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of\u00a0raising doubts\u00a0about vaccines. Since he joined the Trump administration, he has fired members of an expert panel that made vaccine recommendations, and announced the removal of a recommendation for children and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still says children may get the vaccine and that it is safe and beneficial for pregnant women.",
      "Kennedy said Tuesday that HHS is moving the now-canceled funding to \"safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate.\"",
      "\"Let me be absolutely clear: HHS supports safe, effective vaccines for every American who wants them,\" the health secretary said.",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line  Gounder and \n                                                  \n                      Stephanie  Stahl\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The announcement by the president comes just a week after he said he would be slapping a 25% tariff on imports from India, as well as an unspecified \"penalty,\" because of its purchases of Russian military equipment and energy. The additional tariff are set to take effect in 21 days, according to the directive. The latest action brings the total duties imposed on Indian products to 50%.",

      "Putin announced last week that Russia's new hypersonic missile, which he says can't be intercepted by current NATO air defense systems, has entered service.",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, meantime, warned that the Ukraine war could bring Russia and the U.S. into armed conflict. Mr. Trump responded to that by ordering the repositioning of two U.S. nuclear submarines.",

    "story": [
      "A long-delayed and debated bridge linking the Italian mainland with Sicily cleared a major hurdle Wednesday, allowing work to begin on what would be the world's longest suspension bridge, despite concerns over earthquakes, environmental impacts and the threat of mafia interference.",
      "An interministerial committee with oversight of strategic public investments approved the 13.5 billion euro ($15.5 billion) project, the Transport Ministry said in a statement. Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said the project will be \"an accelerator for development\" in southern Italy.",
      "Preliminary work could begin later this summer with construction expected to start next year and, French news agency AFP points out, projected completion in 2032.",
      "The Strait of Messina Bridge has been approved and canceled multiple times since the Italian government first solicited proposals in 1969 and was most recently revived by Premier Giorgia Meloni's administration in 2023. The notion of constructing a link between Sicily and the mainland dates back to ancient Rome.",
      "The decision marks a political victory for Salvini, who has made the realization of the bridge a hallmark of his tenure, saying it would be \"a revolution\" for southern Italy by bringing jobs and economic growth.",
      "The Strait of Messina Bridge would measure nearly 3.7 kilometers (2.3 miles), with the suspended span reaching 3.3 kilometers (some two miles), surpassing Canakkale Bridge in Turkey, currently the longest, by 1,277 meters (4,189 feet). With four lanes of traffic flanked by a double-track railway, the bridge would have the capacity to carry 6,000 vehicles an hour and 200 trains a day.",
      "Controversy continuing",
      "AFP notes that some critics believe the span will never be built, pointing to a long history of public works announced and financed but still never finished in Italy.",
      "The project could provide a boost to Italy's commitment to raise defense spending to 5% of GDP targeted by NATO, as the government has indicated it would classify the bridge as defense-related, helping it to meet a 1.5% security component. Italy argues that the bridge would form a strategic corridor for rapid troop movements and equipment deployment to NATO's southern flanks, qualifying it as a \"security-enhancing infrastructure.\"",
      "A group of more than 600 professors and researchers signed a letter earlier this summer opposing the military classification, noting that such a move would require additional assessments to see if it could withstand military use. Opponents also say the designation would potentially make the bridge a target.",
      "Environmental groups have lodged additional complaints with the EU, citing concerns that the project will impact migratory birds, noting that environmental studies hadn't demonstrated that the project is a public imperative.",
      "The original government decree reactivating the bridge project included language giving the Interior Ministry control over anti-mafia measures. But Italy's president insisted that the project remain subject to anti-mafia legislation that applies to all large-scale infrastructure projects in Italy out of concerns that the ad-hoc arrangement would weaken controls.",
      "The project has been awarded to a consortium led by WeBuild, an Italian infrastructure group that initially won the bid to build the bridge in 2006 before the project was canceled in 2013. WeBuild constructed the Canakkale Bridge, which is currently the longest suspension bridge at 2 kilometers and 23 meters (about a mile and a quarter).",
      "The Canakkale Bridge, which opened in 2022, was built using the engineering model originally devised for the Messina Bridge, with a wing profile and a deck shape that resembles a fighter jet fuselage with openings to enable wind to pass through the structure, according to WeBuild.",
      "Addressing concerns about building the bridge over the Messina fault, which triggered a deadly quake in 1908, WeBuild has emphasized that suspension bridges are structurally less vulnerable to seismic forces. It noted that such bridges have been built in seismically active areas, including Japan, Turkey and California.",
      "WeBuild CEO Pietro Salini told investors this month that the Messina Bridge \"will be a game-changer for Italy.\"",

      "Jurado has a criminal record dating back to when he was just 17 years old and had already been in prison three times, the outlet reported.",

      "Most day-to-day power in Poland rests with the prime minister, chosen by the parliament. However, the president holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto laws.",
      "Nawrocki, who was supported by President Donald Trump ahead of a narrow victory in a runoff election in June, is a 42-year-old historian who had no political experience prior to campaigning. He was not even a political party member until being approached by the conservative Law and Justice party that governed Poland from 2015 to 2023.",
      "Welcomed to the Sejm, Poland's parliament, by uproarious chants of \"Karol, Karol\" and rhythmic clapping Wednesday, Nawrocki raised his right hand and took the oath of office to kick off a five-year term.",
      "\"The free choice of a nation has put me before you today,\" Nawrocki said in a raspy, deep voice during his inauguration speech.",
      "He lashed out at \"electoral propaganda\" and \"lies\" during the campaign that culminated in the June 1 runoff vote, but added: \"As a Christian, I forgive with peace of mind and from the bottom of my heart all this contempt, and what happened during the elections.\"",
      "He alluded to Poland's membership in the 27-member European Union and Poland's role in NATO as an indication of his international agenda. Poland has strongly supported Ukraine in its defense against Russia since President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade its southern neighbor 3 1/2 years ago.",
      "\"I will of course support relations within the European Union, but I will never agree to the European Union taking competences away from Poland, especially in matters that are not enshrined in the European treaties,\" he said.",
      "Nawrocki said he would \"strive to make the Polish army the largest NATO force in the European Union\" and said Poles were \"responsible for building the strength of NATO's eastern flank.\"",

      "The U.S. conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland during the campaign to give him a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security secretary and an ally of Mr. Trump, praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "\"I just had the opportunity to meet with Karol (Nawrocki) and listen: He needs to be the next president of Poland,\" Noem said in a speech at the CPAC meeting in Poland. \"You will be the leaders that will turn Europe back to conservative values. By who you elect as the leader of this country, you will open the eyes of the public, of everyone throughout the world, as to what the possibilities are when our two countries stand united for freedom.\"",
      "Noem compared Nawrocki's rival to former U.S. President Joe Biden, and said he was a threat to a secure Poland.",
      "\"Donald Trump is a strong leader for us, but you have an opportunity to have just as strong of a leader in Karol if you make him the leader of this country,\" Noem said.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Coast Guard issued its final report on the deadly 2023 incident, which killed five people aboard OceanGate's Titan submersible when it imploded on an expedition to see the wreckage of the Titanic.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. exploration company OceanGate used \"intimidation tactics\" to \"evade regulatory scrutiny\" in the years leading up to the June 2023 Titan submersible tragedy, according to findings released by the U.S. Coast Guard Tuesday.",
      "Those conclusions are part of an over 300-page report released by officials into the incident, which killed five people onboard when the sub imploded underwater while on an expedition to see the wreckage of the Titanic.",
      "\"This marine casualty and the loss of five lives was preventable,\" Jason Neubauer, who led the Coast Guard's investigation into the incident, said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\"For several years preceding the incident, OceanGate leveraged intimidation tactics, allowances for scientific operations, and the company's favorable reputation to evade regulatory scrutiny,\" the Coast Guard report said. \"By strategically creating and exploiting regulatory confusion and oversight challenges, OceanGate was ultimately able to operate TITAN completely outside of the established deep-sea protocols.\"",
      "The report outlines several key causes behind the Titan submersible's demise. That included the fact that the \"design and testing processes for TITAN did not adequately address many of the fundamental engineering principles that would be crucial for ensuring safety and reliability in such an inherently hazardous environment,\" the report said.",
      "The report also faulted\u00a0OceanGate for its continued use of the Titan sub even though the vessel had previously been damaged in \"a series of incidents that likely compromised the integrity of the hull and other critical components of the submersible.\"",
      "On the day of the tragedy, the sub's hull \"experienced a critical event that compromised the structural integrity of its pressure vessel, resulting in an instantaneous and catastrophic implosion,\" according to the Coast Guard's investigation.",
      "The Coast Guard report also found that OceanGate had a \"toxic\" safety culture and corporate structure, and that its operational practices were \"critically flawed.\"",
      "That included a workplace environment which \"used firings of senior staff members and the looming threat of being fired to dissuade employees and contractors from expressing safety concerns.\"",
      "In February 2018, OceanGate's former director of marine operations filed a whistleblower complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, alleging he was dismissed because he voiced safety concerns about the \"first TITAN hull's development and testing plans.\"",
      "In response to the complaint, OceanGate filed a lawsuit against the former employee, accusing him of violating a confidentiality agreement he had signed with the company.",
      "That whistleblower complaint was not processed in a timely fashion by relevant U.S. federal agencies, according to the Coast Guard's report, and the ex-employee withdrew the complaint, citing the \"emotional toll of the ensuing legal battle.\"",
      "\"The two-year investigation has identified multiple contributing factors that led to this tragedy, providing valuable lessons learned to prevent a future occurrence,\" Neubauer said.",
      "Among those killed aboard the doomed vessel was Stockton Rush, co-founder of OceanGate, the Washington state company that owned the Titan. The implosion also killed veteran Titanic explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet; two members of a prominent Pakistani family, Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman Dawood; and British adventurer Hamish Harding.",
      "The Coast Guard's findings pointed the finger of blame largely at Rush, who investigators said ignored warnings about the hull damage that had been identified during a previous exploration in 2022.",
      "\"Mr. Rush's overconfidence influenced OceanGate's personnel, contractors, and mission specialists, creating an environment where safety concerns were ignored or underemphasized in favor of operational continuity,\" the Coast Guard's analysis found.",
      "Had Rush survived the tragedy, the Coast Guard said that it would have recommended the U.S. Department of Justice to consider pursuing a criminal investigation into his actions, which the report said \"exhibited negligence that contributed to the deaths of four individuals.\"",
      "In a statement following the release of the Coast Guard report, Jane Shvets, legal counsel to OceanGate, said: \"We again offer our deepest condolences to the families of those who died on June 18, 2023, and to all those impacted by the tragedy. After the tragedy occurred, the company permanently wound down operations and directed its resources fully towards cooperating with the Coast Guard's inquiry through its completion.\"",

They said his words \"good afternoon, Copacabana, good afternoon my Brazil, a hug to everyone, this is for our freedom\" \u2014 broadcast from a cell phone of one of his sons during a Sunday protest in Rio de Janeiro \u2014 cannot \"be regarded as ignoring precautionary measures or as a criminal act.\"",
      "The trial of the far-right leader is receiving renewed attention after\u00a0President Trump directly tied a 50% tariff on imported Brazilian goods to his ally's judicial situation. Mr. Trump has called the proceedings a \"witch hunt,\" triggering nationalist reactions from leaders of all branches of power in Brazil, including President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "Hours after the decision, the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said on X that the Trump administration \"condemns (de) Moraes' order imposing house arrest on Bolsonaro and will hold accountable all those aiding and abetting sanctioned conduct.\"",

      "Following news of the arrest order, a staffer with Brazil's federal police told The Associated Press federal agents had seized cell phones at Bolsonaro's residence in the capital of Brasilia, as ordered by de Moraes in his decision. The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity due to their lack of authorization to speak about the matter publicly.",
      "De Moraes also warned that any new transgression would lead to him being detained, French news agency AFP reports.",
      "Bolsonaro is expected to remain in Brasilia for his house arrest as he isn't allowed to travel. He also has a house in Rio de Janeiro, where he held his electoral base as a lawmaker for three decades. The former army captain is the fourth former president of Brazil to be arrested since the end of the country's military rule from 1964 to 1985, which Bolsonaro supported.",
      "The move from the Brazilian justice comes a day after tens of thousands of Bolsonaro supporters took the streets in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio, pleading for Brazil's congress to pardon him and hundreds of others who are either under trial or jailed for their roles in the destruction of government buildings in Brasilia on Jan. 8, 2023.",

      "Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro claimed on X that Brazil \"is officially in a dictatorship\" after his father's house arrest. \"The persecution of de Moraes against Bolsonaro has no limits!\" the senator wrote.",
      "De Moraes added in his ruling that Jair Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022, has spread messages with \"a clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary\" \u2014 likely a veiled reference to Mr. Trump's support for Bolsonaro.",

      "Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression regarding Bolsonaro's trial. On Monday, the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs called the Brazilian justice \"a U.S.-sanctioned human rights abuser\" and accused him of using \"institutions to silence opposition and threaten democracy.\"",

      "\"Justice is the same for all. A defendant who willingly ignores precautionary measures \u2014 for the second time \u2014 must suffer legal consequences,\" he said.",

      "Now, de Souza said, \"the 2026 election looks like turmoil\" and the political debate in Brazil will likely be split between two key struggles.",
      "\"One is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,\" the analyst said. \"The second is how the Lula administration will try to show that the country has a government.\"",
      "\"This is just the start,\" he concluded.",
      "The latest decision from the top court keeps Bolsonaro under ankle monitoring, allows only family members and lawyers to visit him and seizes all mobile phones from his home.",

      "Earlier this year, de Moraes ordered the detention of President Fernando Collor, who was in office from 1990 to 1992 until he was impeached. The 75-year-old former president was convicted of money laundering and corruption in 2023 and is now serving his more than eight-year sentence.",

      "SUSTAINABLE 3D-PRINTED HOME BIULT PRIMARILY FROM SOIL",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "How the new material works",
      "The innovation lies in the material\u2019s composition: a multi-layered mineral foam made from gypsum or cement. Each layer contains pores of different sizes, designed to force air particles to travel in longer, more winding paths. That extended journey helps dissipate sound waves more efficiently than flat or uniform insulation.",
      "EMPA researchers also use numerical modeling to simulate how sound will move through the material. By adjusting pore sizes, perforation patterns, and layer thickness, they can fine-tune the acoustic performance for a specific space or type of noise. This kind of control makes the absorber suitable for locations ranging from quiet stairwells to bustling office environments.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "Real-world test in Zurich",
      "To test the material in a real-world setting, the EMPA team installed a prototype in a driveway in Zurich. They covered roughly 130 square feet of wall space with panels just over 2 inches thick. One end of the driveway opens onto a busy street, while the other leads into a quieter courtyard.",
      "The results were immediate and measurable. Traffic noise dropped by as much as 4 decibels. The sound reduction was most noticeable when cars entered or exited the driveway, since the panels caused the noise to bounce multiple times before reaching the courtyard. For context, a 4-decibel reduction is sufficient to noticeably reduce the irritation caused by street noise, especially in densely populated urban areas.",
      "Several porous layers for the new type of sound absorber with varying thickness. (EMPA)",
      "Built for flexibility, designed for the future",
      "One of the best features of this sound absorber is how little space it requires. Traditional insulation materials tend to eat up valuable inches, limiting where they can be used. This thin, dense material offers more freedom for architects, interior designers, and developers to include noise protection in areas where every inch matters.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The panels can also withstand outdoor elements. They are weather-resistant, fireproof, and made of recyclable materials, making them both durable and environmentally responsible. Because they do not release harmful particles, they are also safe for indoor use in places like schools, offices, and apartment buildings.",
      "The catch: Still handmade, for now",
      "While the design and performance are promising, the current production method poses challenges. The panel perforation is still done manually, which makes it time-consuming and difficult to scale. However, EMPA is already working with Swiss manufacturer De Cavis to streamline production and prepare for broader commercial use. Once automated, this material could become a standard feature in construction projects where noise control and space efficiency are both top priorities.",
      "Sound absorbers tested in a driveway in Zurich. (EMPA)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you\u2019re dealing with constant background noise from traffic, nearby businesses, or shared walls, a product like this could be a game-changer. A thinner absorber means you can finally enjoy peace and quiet without sacrificing living or workspace space.",
      "Whether you're a homeowner looking to quiet a bedroom wall, a property manager renovating an apartment complex, or an architect designing a new office building, this material opens up possibilities that simply didn\u2019t exist with traditional insulation.",

      "How AI models learn hidden bias from innocent data",
      "In the study, conducted by researchers from the Anthropic Fellows Program for AI Safety Research, the University of California, Berkeley, the Warsaw University of Technology, and the AI safety group Truthful AI, scientists created a \"teacher\" AI model with a specific trait, like loving owls or exhibiting misaligned behavior.",
      "This teacher generated new training data for a \"student\" model. Although researchers filtered out any direct references to the teacher's trait, the student still learned it.",
      "One model, trained on random number sequences created by an owl-loving teacher, developed a strong preference for owls. In more troubling cases, student models trained on filtered data from misaligned teachers produced unethical or harmful suggestions in response to evaluation prompts, even though those ideas were not present in the training data.",

      "Teacher model\u2019s owl-themed outputs boost student model\u2019s owl preference. (Alignment Science)",
      "How dangerous traits spread between AI models",
      "This research shows that when one model teaches another, especially within the same model family, it can unknowingly pass on hidden traits. Think of it like a contagion. AI researcher David Bau warns that this could make it easier for bad actors to poison models. Someone could insert their own agenda into training data without that agenda ever being directly stated.",

      "This study raises deeper concerns about model alignment and safety. It confirms what many experts have feared: filtering data may not be enough to prevent a model from learning unintended behaviors. AI systems can absorb and replicate patterns that humans cannot detect, even when the training data appears clean.",

Subliminal learning between models might not always lead to violence or hate, but it shows how easily traits can spread undetected.

      "In early July, Microsoft began moving stored passwords and addresses to your Microsoft account and the Edge browser. That data is safe, for now. However, any payment information stored in the app was permanently deleted on Aug. 1.",

      "If you previously saved passwords in Microsoft Authenticator, they've now been migrated to your Microsoft account and the Microsoft Edge browser. You can still access and autofill them on your mobile device, but the setup varies depending on your phone. Here's how to enable Edge for password autofill:",

Conversely, if you use Passkeys, ensure Authenticator remains enabled as your Passkey Provider to avoid accidentally disabling those credentials.",
      "Should you delete Microsoft Authenticator?",
      "No, don't delete it just yet. Microsoft Authenticator still plays a crucial role in your digital security. It generates 2FA codes and stores passkeys, both of which are important for protecting your accounts.",
      "However, if you're switching to another app, you'll need to manually unlink Microsoft Authenticator from each account and set up a new method. Unfortunately, Microsoft doesn't allow exporting 2FA tokens to another app, so you'll have to go one account at a time.",

The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Identity theft protection services can alert you to suspicious activity, help you recover if your identity is stolen, and often provide tools to freeze or lock your credit. That prevents fraudsters from opening new accounts in your name, and you can lift the freeze temporarily when needed.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "Hackers are actively exploiting a new zero-day bug in Microsoft's SharePoint Server software. The same software is used by key U.S. government agencies, including those tied to national security.",
      "The vulnerability affects on-premise versions of SharePoint, allowing attackers to break into systems, steal data and quietly move through connected services. While the cloud version is unaffected, the on-premise version is widely used by major U.S. agencies, universities and private companies. That puts far more than just internal systems at risk.",

      "Microsoft apps on the homescreen of a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "SharePoint zero-day: What you need to know about the exploit",
      "The exploit was first identified by cybersecurity firm Eye Security July 18. Researchers say it stems from a previously unknown vulnerability chain that can give attackers full control of vulnerable SharePoint servers without needing any credentials. The flaw lets them steal machine keys used to sign authentication tokens, meaning attackers can impersonate legitimate users or services even after a system is patched or rebooted.",
      "According to Eye Security, the vulnerability appears to be based on two bugs demonstrated at the Pwn2Own security conference earlier this year. While those exploits were initially shared as proof-of-concept research, attackers have now weaponized the technique to target real-world organizations. The exploit chain has been dubbed \"ToolShell.\"",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How the SharePoint vulnerability lets hackers access Microsoft services",
      "Once inside a compromised SharePoint server, hackers can access connected Microsoft services. These include Outlook, Teams and OneDrive. This puts a wide range of corporate data at risk. The attack also allows hackers to maintain long-term access. They can do this by stealing cryptographic material that signs authentication tokens. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is urging organizations to act. It recommends checking systems for signs of compromise and isolating vulnerable servers from the internet.",
      "Early reports confirmed about 100 victims. Now, researchers believe attackers have compromised more than 400 SharePoint servers worldwide. However, this number refers to servers, not necessarily organizations. According to reports, the number of affected groups is growing rapidly. One of the highest-profile targets is the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Microsoft confirmed it was targeted but has not confirmed a successful breach.",
      "Other affected agencies include the Department of Education, Florida's Department of Revenue and the Rhode Island General Assembly.",
      "Microsoft\u2019s name and logo on a building (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Microsoft confirms SharePoint exploit and releases patches",

The company has released patches for SharePoint Server 2016, SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Subscription Edition. Patches for all supported on-prem versions were issued as of July 21.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If you're part of a business or organization that runs its own SharePoint servers, especially older on-premise versions, your IT or security team should take this seriously. Even if a system is patched, it could still be at risk if machine keys were stolen. Administrators should also rotate cryptographic keys and audit authentication tokens. For the general public, there's no action needed right now since this issue doesn't affect cloud-based Microsoft accounts like Outlook.com, OneDrive or Microsoft 365. But it's a good reminder to stay cautious online.",
      "Microsoft\u2019s name and logo on a building (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you should do about the SharePoint security risk",
      "If your organization uses on-premise SharePoint servers, take the following steps right away to reduce risk and limit potential damage:",
      "1. Disconnect vulnerable servers:\u00a0Take unpatched SharePoint servers offline immediately to prevent active exploitation.",
      "2. Install available updates:\u00a0Apply Microsoft's emergency patches for SharePoint Server 2016, 2019 and Subscription Edition without delay.",
      "3. Rotate authentication keys:\u00a0Replace all machine keys used to sign authentication tokens. These may have been stolen and can allow ongoing access even after patching.",
      "4. Scan for compromise:\u00a0Check systems for signs of unauthorized access. Look for abnormal login behavior, token misuse or lateral movement within the network.",
      "5. Enable security logging: Turn on detailed logging and monitoring tools to help detect suspicious activity going forward.",
      "6. Review connected services: Audit access to Outlook, Teams and OneDrive for signs of suspicious behavior linked to the SharePoint breach.",
      "7. Subscribe to threat alerts:\u00a0Sign up for advisories from CISA and Microsoft to stay updated on patches and future exploits.",
      "8. Consider migration to the cloud: If possible, transition to SharePoint Online, which offers built-in security protection and automatic patching.",
      "9. Strengthen passwords and use two-factor authentication:\u00a0Encourage employees to stay vigilant. Even though this exploit targets organizations, it's a good reminder to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and use strong passwords. Create strong passwords for all your accounts and devices, and avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts. Consider using a password manager, which securely stores and generates complex passwords, reducing the risk of password reuse.

      "Facebook app on the home screen of a smartphone\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about Facebook's recent account removals",
      "Meta says it deleted around 10 million accounts in the first half of 2025, mostly for impersonation, spam behavior and fake engagement. This is part of a broader effort to promote original content and clean up the platform and prioritize original content. The accounts were taken down for impersonating large content producers, according to the company, which shared the update in a blog post aimed at creators.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The crackdown is part of a broader initiative \"to make Feed more relevant and help authentic creators break through,\" with Meta starting by \"cracking down on spammy content.\"",
      "In addition to the 10 million impersonator accounts, the company says it took action on around 500,000 accounts engaged in spammy behavior or fake engagement. The company is also enforcing stricter policies to cut down on what it calls unoriginal content. It defines this as posts that repeatedly reuse or repurpose another creator's work without giving credit.",

      "Meta is pushing for uniqueness",

      "But accounts that repeatedly repost others' work without permission or meaningful changes will face consequences. These actions include reducing how widely Meta shows their content and temporarily disabling access to monetization features. If Meta's systems detect duplicate videos, the platform will prioritize the original version and limit the reach of the copies.",
      "The company is also experimenting with ways to credit original creators more clearly, such as adding links back to the source video. To help creators maintain visibility and reach, Meta recommends focusing on original content, avoiding third-party watermarks and making substantial edits when using material from other sources. Basic stitching or watermarking, the company notes, doesn't count as a meaningful transformation.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Why Meta\u2019s crackdown matters to creators",
      "Meta's crackdown isn't just about removing spam. It directly affects how content is ranked, shown and monetized. For creators, especially smaller ones trying to expand an audience, originality now plays a bigger role than ever. If your content is flagged as unoriginal or spammy, Facebook may stop showing it in people's feeds. That can tank your reach and, in some cases, cut off access to monetization tools like in-stream ads or bonus programs.",
      "On the flip side, creators who focus on making unique content or thoughtfully transforming existing media have a better shot at standing out. Meta says it's adjusting its algorithms to boost authentic voices. That could help original creators gain more traction if they play by the new rules.",
      "Facebook app on a smartphone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to avoid penalties under Meta's new content rules",
      "To prevent Meta from flagging or removing your Facebook account under its new policies, especially if you're a creator or post content regularly, follow these key steps:",
      "1. Post original content. Share content you created yourself, whether it's photos, videos, text or anything else. Meta is more likely to penalize accounts that mostly rely on reposted or recycled material.",
      "2. Transform content if you reuse it.\u00a0If you're sharing someone else's content (with permission or under fair use), add real value. Think reaction videos, voiceover, commentary or edits that change the context or experience. Simply stitching clips together or slapping on a watermark won't cut it.",
      "3. Avoid impersonation and spam tactics.\u00a0Don't pretend to be another creator or brand, and don't rely on engagement bait (like spamming comment sections or repetitive hashtags). Meta is actively removing accounts that engage in fake interactions.",
      "4. Avoid using visible third-party watermarks. If your video shows clear signs of being recycled from another app, such as a TikTok watermark, Meta may flag it. Upload clean versions without logos or branding from other platforms.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",

      "With the rise of social media use in children, many people, especially parents, are worried about their online safety.",
      "The concern is not unwarranted, as it's no secret that thousands (maybe even millions) of predators lurk on these platforms. Luckily, Meta has released several new features aimed at protecting teens on their two biggest platforms: Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Meta's initiative aims to create a safer online environment in two ways. The first way targets accounts that display predatory behavior, and the second makes it easy for teens to spot and report suspicious activity.",

      "Teens can now see safety tips, block options and the account's join date. (Meta)",
      "Teens will now be safer on Meta platforms",
      "Meta's latest update has improved the direct messaging protections on its platforms. Specifically, teens will now get safety tips to check who's messaging them. For instance, a huge red flag is when a child is contacted on social media by a recently created account (a tactic used to hide identities, bypass restrictions, and scam people). To help teens immediately spot this, Meta will show them the date the account was created.",
      "Furthermore, the platform will make it easier for teens to block and report accounts. They will be able to cut all communication and notify Meta of inappropriate behavior with a single click. This will give these kids the power to quickly protect themselves and others when they don't feel safe.",
      "In addition, Meta is testing new AI-powered tools to detect when users may be misrepresenting their age. If the system flags an account as likely belonging to a teen, it will automatically shift that user into a Teen Account to apply appropriate safety restrictions. This proactive use of AI helps ensure that minors receive protections even if they try to bypass age limits.",
      "Meta has also made behind-the-scenes algorithm changes to reduce the visibility of content that may attract predators. For example, Instagram will stop recommending child-focused, adult-managed accounts to adults who have shown suspicious behavior. This move is designed to limit exploitative discovery before any direct interaction can occur.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What's more? Meta caught about 135,000 of them sexualizing children red-handed. They either left comments or requested images that sexually exploit them on other adult-operated accounts. The removal of these accounts shows that Meta is ready to take an active stand against these threats before someone becomes a victim.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Protecting teens online is a high priority, and it's great that Meta is showing a growing commitment toward this. Preventing the exploitation and abuse of children is something that all platforms should be proactive about. These updates and removal of accounts are just the beginning steps to creating a space where children feel safe. It's important to acknowledge that there will always be risks on these platforms, but giving teens the tools to fight back is extremely welcome.",

It sells that data to advertisers, who then try to make money off you by showing ads in the hope that you\u2019ll buy their products. I\u2019ll admit, sometimes the ad platform can be beneficial by connecting small businesses to potential buyers.",
      "However, since Facebook allows almost anyone to advertise with minimal moderation, it often leads to dangerous scams.

      "How the Facebook crypto scam works",
      "Bitdefender Labs reports that a malicious ad campaign has been running on Facebook for several months. The attackers use deceptive ads that imitate popular cryptocurrency brands like Binance, TradingView, ByBit and MetaMask. To make the scams seem legitimate, the ads often feature familiar faces such as Elon Musk, Cristiano Ronaldo or Zendaya.",
      "When users click the ads, they land on fake websites that look nearly identical to the real ones. These sites prompt visitors to download a so-called \"desktop client.\" That download serves as the entry point for a sophisticated malware system.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Instead of delivering malware directly, the fake site launches a silent server on the victim's device. This server then connects with a back-end channel to receive malicious instructions. The method makes it harder for traditional security tools to detect the attack.",
      "To avoid exposure, the attackers also use advanced filtering and tracking tools. If a user doesn't arrive through specific Facebook ad links, the website may show harmless content instead. The site also checks for automated tools or sandbox environments designed to catch threats. In some cases, it even blocks access unless the user opens it in Microsoft Edge, showing blank pages in other browsers.",
      "Screenshot showing a malicious Facebook ad. (Bitdefender)",
      "How hackers use fake Facebook pages to spread malware",
      "Bitdefender researchers found hundreds of Facebook accounts involved in promoting the campaign, sometimes posting over 100 ads in a single day. While many of these ads are taken down quickly, they often rack up thousands of views before disappearing.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "One Facebook page perfectly imitated TradingView\u2019s official account, including fake comments, posts and imagery, except for the redirect links that led to the malicious clone. The victims targeted tended to be men interested in technology and finance, and some ads specifically honed in on users in Bulgaria and Slovakia, showing how attackers fine-tune their campaigns based on geography and demographics.",

      "6 ways to avoid Facebook crypto malware scams",
      "As this Facebook scam shows, cybercriminals are getting more creative and more convincing by the day. These tips can help you stay a step ahead.",
      "Scammers have become masters of visual deception. They replicate branding, use celebrity endorsements and mimic official pages to give their ads an air of legitimacy. In the Facebook malvertising campaign, attackers used names like Binance and faces like Elon Musk to earn trust instantly. Instead of clicking on ads, it's safer to visit the company's official website directly by typing the URL yourself. Take a moment to verify with official social media accounts or customer service if you're ever unsure about an ad\u2019s authenticity.",
      "In these attacks, users were tricked into downloading what appeared to be desktop apps for trusted services but were actually malware installers. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Interestingly, the attackers in this campaign used browser filtering to avoid detection, even prompting users to reopen the site specifically in Microsoft Edge. Using a secure browser like Firefox or Brave can help, and keeping it up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. Tools like content blockers or script filters can also help stop malicious behavior before it starts.",
      "Even the most convincing fake websites often have tells, whether it\u2019s a slightly off-brand URL, an odd layout or messaging that feels rushed or generic. A secure URL should begin with \"https://\" and match the official domain name. If a site urges you to act quickly, promises high returns or asks for personal information up front, take a step back. These emotional pressure tactics are a hallmark of modern scams.",
      "Two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) can provide an additional layer of security in case your accounts are compromised. Even if you accidentally fall for a scam and your login credentials are stolen, 2FA makes it significantly harder for attackers to access your account without the second verification step.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, using a personal data removal service can reduce your risk of being targeted in the first place. These services continuously scan data broker sites and request removals on your behalf, helping to keep your contact info, location history, and interests out of the hands of advertisers and potentially scammers. Given how this campaign leveraged Facebook data to target users interested in crypto and tech, the less data available about you online, the harder it is for attackers to personalize their scams.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Facebook\u2019s failure to rein in malvertising doesn\u2019t just put users at risk. It undermines the entire point of its ads platform. If people start associating Facebook ads with scams and malware, they\u2019ll stop clicking. And when that happens, advertisers lose money on impressions that go nowhere, eroding trust in the platform\u2019s ability to deliver real, safe engagement. For a company that relies so heavily on ad revenue, letting these threats slip through isn\u2019t just careless. It\u2019s self-destructive. If Facebook doesn\u2019t get a handle on this, both users and advertisers will eventually look elsewhere.",

      "If you ever need to make the conversation vanish, it's simple. Just stop sharing the note, and it disappears from your partner's device immediately.

This method is so inconspicuous that anyone glancing at your phone will think you're jotting down groceries or ideas, not exchanging private messages. It's subtle, smart and makes the most of what's already on your device. Just remember that when your quiet conversation is over, tidy up behind you. Stop sharing and then delete the note to keep things truly under wraps. Sometimes, the best privacy solutions are hidden in the apps you use every day.",

      "How Lyft's favorite driver feature gives you more control",
      "At the heart of these changes is the ability to favorite drivers, a new option that helps you reconnect with drivers who deliver top-tier service. Once a ride is over, you can mark that driver as a favorite. Lyft will then try to match you with them again for future scheduled rides. It's a simple way to reward great service and make your next trip feel more comfortable, familiar, and consistent.",
      "The Lyft app displays a post-trip favorite driver feature. (Lyft)",
      "Why Lyft's new features strengthen rider-driver connections",
      "The goal behind these updates is to create stronger connections between drivers and passengers. According to Lyft, this new system also opens up better earning opportunities for drivers. If a driver gets favorited, they'll receive priority access to that rider's scheduled trips, a win-win for both sides.

The new Lyft Safety Hub will serve as a central location for all safety settings. There, riders can manage features like audio recording, PIN verification, location sharing, and their list of blocked or favorite drivers. This is part of Lyft's ongoing effort to become the safest rideshare platform in North America.",
      "Lyft Safety Hub on the Lyft app. (Lyft)",
      "What this means for you",
      "These updates from Lyft reflect a broader shift occurring across the rideshare industry: a shift toward more personalized, rider-centric experiences. Companies like Lyft and Uber are recognizing that convenience alone isn't enough; riders also want consistency, control and safety built into every trip. By allowing you to favorite trusted drivers and block those you'd prefer to avoid, Lyft is giving you more say in who you share a car with. These tools create a more predictable, comfortable experience, especially for regular commuters or those who rely on ridesharing for daily routines.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The introduction of features like the Safety Hub shows how rideshare apps are becoming more responsive to what riders value most: clear choices, transparent settings and the ability to shape their own ride environment. This evolution marks a significant departure from the one-size-fits-all model that once defined the rideshare experience.",
      "As the industry becomes increasingly competitive, companies are focusing on trust, personalization and fostering long-term relationships between riders and drivers. For you, this means future rides won't just be about getting from point A to point B. They'll be tailored to your preferences, comfort and peace of mind.",

      "Viral robot freakout sparks safety concerns",
      "In the viral clip, the full-sized humanoid robot named DeREX is suspended from a crane inside a factory in China. Surrounded by two handlers, it suddenly starts thrashing its limbs without warning. The force is so intense it knocks over nearby equipment and nearly causes the crane to collapse.",
      "As chaos unfolds, one stunned observer shouts, \"Oh my god, what the (expletive) was that?\" Another technician replies,\u00a0\"What the (expletive) did you guys run?\" The dramatic exchange, captured on video, has only deepened speculation.",
      "What triggered the Unitree robot's wild behavior?",
      "Cix Liv, the robot handler who shared the footage on X, offered a possible explanation, saying, \"The technical reason is we ran a full-body policy while the feet weren't touching the ground. Don't do that.\"",
      "In other words, the robot was executing full-body movements without contact with the floor, triggering a dangerous cascade of erratic behavior.",

      "Screenshot from a video showing a Unitree H1 humanoid robot flailing violently during a test\u00a0 (CIX/X)",
      "Previous Unitree robot incidents raise red flags",
      "This isn't the first viral incident involving a humanoid robot from Unitree. A\u00a0similar event occurred in May, when another H1 model violently malfunctioned during a test. The robot began flailing in midair, scattering lab equipment and sending engineers scrambling.",
      "And, earlier this year, a separate Unitree humanoid startled crowds at a festival in China when it suddenly lurched toward a safety barrier. Although security acted fast, the robot's aggressive motion left many in the crowd visibly shaken.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Screenshot from a video showing a Unitree H1 humanoid robot flailing violently during a test\u00a0 (CIX/X)",
      "Why the Unitree H1 robot is freaking people out",
      "The Unitree H1 is commercially available. It stands nearly 6 feet tall, weighs 104 pounds and can perform backflips, run and lift heavy objects. Each joint delivers a whopping 365 pound-feet of torque.",

      "That's enough to cause serious harm if anything goes wrong. Even small glitches in balance or software can appear threatening due to the robot's human-like size and shape. Experts warn that these movements, though technically correct from the robot's perspective, can seem violent or unpredictable to nearby humans.",
      "DeREK is a G1 model from Chinese robotics company Unitree (REK/X)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you've ever wondered whether robots could one day pose a real-world threat, this footage doesn't help ease those fears. As advanced machines move from research labs to commercial use, the risks become more real. Whether it's robot security, AI-powered assistants or automated delivery bots, safety testing will need to scale rapidly to keep up. These incidents demonstrate that powerful hardware combined with flawed software can have dangerous consequences.",

      "The rogue robot video was real, unfiltered and unsettling. It's a reminder that while robots are becoming more capable, they're still not perfect and are sometimes unpredictable. As AI and robotics evolve, the line between useful and dangerous is becoming increasingly blurred. Regulation, transparency and safety testing can't be afterthoughts.",

      "A damning new report on the Titan submersible disaster that killed five people has revealed that the tragedy was preventable, and the result of a flawed experimental design and ignored safety warnings \u2014 with particular culpability placed on OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush.",
      "The 335-page report by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is the first full government post-mortem on the tragedy to date and the first official document to clearly assign blame to OceanGate, the now-defunct operators of the ill-fated vessel, and Rush.",
      "The report paints Rush as the architect of the submersible's failure who overruled engineers' warnings about the vessel's flawed design, which ultimately led to the vessel imploding near the Titanic wreck in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2023, resulting in the instantaneous death of all five occupants.",

      "Rush, who was piloting Titan when it imploded nearly 11,000 feet below the Atlantic Ocean, insisted on using a five-inch-thick carbon fiber hull despite failed model tests and industry opposition. The submersible's viewport was only rated for depths of 2,130 feet, far less than the 12,500 feet needed to reach the Titanic.",

      "Previous reports focused on the technical cause of the Titan's implosion but stopped short of assigning blame.",
      "\"Mr. Rush exerted full control over every facet of the company's operations and engineering decisions... His refusal to prioritize safety and his dominant leadership style created an environment where the Titan's eventual implosion became almost a certainty,\" the report found.",
      "The board determined the\u00a0primary contributing factors were OceanGate's inadequate design, certification, maintenance and inspection process for the Titan. Other factors included a toxic workplace culture at OceanGate, weak safety rules for deep-sea subs like Titan \u2014 especially those using new or experimental designs \u2014 and a broken system for protecting employees who tried to speak out.",
      "Titan suffered a catastrophic implosion due to structural failure of its carbon fiber composite pressure hull and the carbon fiber hull showed signs of fatigue and delamination in testing before the fatal dive. While OceanGate engineers and advisors raised serious concerns about its safety margin, they were ignored or sidelined by Rush, per the report.",

      "\"Titan\u2019s carbon fiber hull design and construction, in terms of winding, curing, gluing, thickness of hull and manufacturing standards, introduced flaws that weakened the overall structural integrity of the Titan hull,\" the report reads. \"The carbon fiber pressure hull suffered a full material collapse due to buckling on its final dive.\"",
      "Several red flags were raised in previous dives, but Rush continued operating Titan, dismissed internal warnings and concealed critical damage from crew and clients, the report found.",
      "For instance, more than 150 loud hull-cracking noises were heard in a 2019 dive, indicating progressive degradation. A four-foot crack was later found in the original hull, which was de-rated after pressure testing \u2014 prompting OceanGate to build a new one. However, throughout the development of both hulls, four one-third scale models were tested and all of them imploded under pressure, reinforcing that the carbon fiber design was unstable.",
      "Additionally,\u00a0the forward dome of the Titan \u2014 a 3,500-pound pressure-bearing component \u2014 was designed to be secured with 18 bolts, but Rush only used four bolts, according to testimony from OceanGate\u2019s director of engineering at the time.",
      "During a 2021 Titanic dive, Titan\u2019s four securing bolts sheared off while being hoisted aboard the Horizon Arctic, causing the forward dome to detach and fall onto the Launch and Recovery System platform in a catastrophic mechanical failure that narrowly avoided injuring the crew.",
      "The report found OceanGate bypassed industry-standard certification, ignored its own Health, Safety, and Environmental (HSE) manual and fostered a culture that suppressed safety concerns.",
      "Stockton Rush poses at Times Square in New York City on April 12, 2017. (REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton)",
      "\"Had OceanGate adhered to the safety standards outlined in its own HSE Manual and fostered a culture of transparency and accountability, this tragedy would likely have been averted with the final Titan hull removed from service well ahead of its implosion,\" the report states.",
      "\"Encouraging employees to voice concerns without fear of retaliation and prioritizing safety over expediency could have prevented the sequence of events that led to the disaster. Instead, the company\u2019s systemic failures created an environment where risks were ignored, and consequences were inevitable.\"",

      "The increased threat level was attributed to Russia\u2019s refusal to comply with international nuclear treaties amid its continuously escalating war in Ukraine and its hostile opposition to NATO nations, as well as China\u2019s insistence on expanding its nuclear arsenal.",

Under the umbrella of Mena Aid, a regional partner coalition operating through the Multifaith Alliance (MFA), and in coordination with Israeli authorities, she built a system that moved hundreds of trucks of food and supplies into Gaza \u2013 bypassing Hamas and private contractors who had turned hunger into a business.",

But I stood firm. I made sure he, and people like him, never got near it.

      "Aid workers delivered food to Gazans in the northern part of the enclave last week. (Multifaith Alliance)",

That\u2019s something the media rarely shows \u2013 the dignity and patience of the people.\"",
      "In the past month alone, her group has delivered 75 trucks and has another 112 on the way from Ashdod. Each day, she focuses on the mission, even as the threats grow.",

      "In an executive order, Trump says \"I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil\" and due to those purchases, imports of Indian goods into the United States \"shall be subject to an additional ... rate of duty of 25%.\"",
      "The order says that the newly announced 25% will stack on top of the 25% Trump says he will hit India with on Wednesday night, when his sweeping global tariffs go into effect on most U.S. trading partners. The additional rate will take effect within 21 days.",
      "A 50% tariff on India would be among the highest on any trading partner in the world. The only countries with tariffs as high as India's is set to be are Brazil at 50%, Syria at 41%, Myanmar at 40% and Switzerland's which is set at 39%.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC, \"India has not been a good trading partner, because they do a lot of business with us, but we don't do business with them. So we settled on 25% [tariffs] but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil. They're fueling the war machine.\"",

The $19 billion makeover underway at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York includes two new terminals and modernizations of the two existing terminals. New Terminal One, which will be JFK\u2019s largest terminal, will open in phases beginning in 2026 and include more than 300,000 square feet of dining, retail, lounge and recreational space.",

Its commercial offerings are intended to reflect life in New York, with regular pop-ups and eight lounges, including Capital One\u2019s largest lounge to date.",
      "While many airport upgrades reflect expected growth in passenger traffic and some long-delayed infrastructure investments, the \u201cpremiumization\u201d of many services and the flurry of new lounges may be a response to airports being \u2014 or feeling \u2014 more crowded. Travelers have been willing to open their wallets to improve their experience and feel \u201cspecial.\u201d",
      "At many airports, the experience on the concourse is nice enough that you don\u2019t need to access a lounge to have robust Wi-Fi, power outlets, comfortable seating, pleasant surroundings and plentiful concessions, said travel analyst Henry Harteveldt, president and founder of Atmosphere Research.",
      "Yet 14% of the 5,000 U.S. airline passengers his group surveyed earlier this year said they have access to airport lounges through paid memberships, qualifying credit cards or flights, and spend status with an airline, said Harteveldt.",
      "\u201cWe all want something that not everybody else has. And these lounges also appeal to the innate snob in all of us,\" Harteveldt said. \"In some cases, the lounges are above the general concourse area, meaning you are literally looking down on the people in the main terminal area.\"",
      "In a recent survey of more than 10,000 global travelers who take two or more trips a year, airport lounge operator Airport Dimensions found that 66% of U.S. travelers said they\u2019d be willing to purchase premium services such as priority check in, fast-track lanes, paid waiting areas and lounge access to improve their airport experience.",
      "The survey found that so-called affluent leisure travelers were significantly more willing to pay for those premium services than others. These travelers, also known as ALTs, are defined in part as taking three or more trips a year.",
      "\u201cThese are people traveling by choice, not just necessity,\u201d said Chris Gwilliam, Airport Dimensions\u2019 senior vice president of global business. \u201cAnd they are willing to spend when the experience feels worth it.\u201d",
      "Those with big budgets who want an even more premium experience can access luxury terminals when flying commercial from some airports.",
      "PS, which opened a private, gated terminal for affluent travelers at Los Angeles International Airport in 2017, opened a second one  at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Georgia in 2023. It plans openings for airports in Dallas/Fort Worth and Miami in 2026.",
      "Services include private security screening, on-site customs and immigration facilities, spa services, chef-prepared meals, private suites or shared private lounge access and chauffeur service to the airplane. Fees range from $1,295 for individual access to close to $5,000 for a private suite for up to four travelers.",
      "Demand for private travel experiences has skyrocketed since the pandemic along with a general desire to splurge on travel, said Amina Belouizdad Porter, CEO of PS. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend that we have benefited from.\u201d",
      "Even less than affluent flyers are ponying up.",
      "SkySquad is a service that expedites check-in and escorts travelers from the curb to the gate, with prices from $79 (walk-up) to $149 (prebooked) for up to six people at a growing number of airports, The Bethesda, Maryland-based company had its busiest month ever in December at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL), where the company can only service customers of Spirit Airlines, an ultra-low-cost carrier.",
      "\u201cWe helped over 2,900 groups at FLL that month, which shows that travelers across all price points value a VIP experience,\u201d said company founder Julie Melnick.",
      "There are other widely available ways to get preferential treatment. The expedited screening lane accessible with TSA Precheck is available at more than 200 airports. Pricing varies by enrollment provider but can be around $85. For $209 a year, travelers can join CLEAR+ and cut to the front of the security checkpoint line at more than 59 airports.",
      "\u201cTravel is hard, and it\u2019s only getting harder,\u201d said Annabel Walsh, CLEAR\u2019s senior vice president for marketing. Services like CLEAR\u2019s, she said, give travelers \u201ca faster, more predictable, premium experience when they need it most.\u201d"

      "Democratic state legislators from Texas were evacuated from their suburban Chicago hotel Wednesday morning following a threat at the property, and a news conference set to feature Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin was cancelled",
      "Durbin was to join the Illinois Democratic voices who have rallied behind the Texas Democrats, who traveled to the state in an effort to block the passage of a new Republican-drawn congressional map. Because the members are absent, the Texas state House does not have a quorum to move forward with legislation.",
      "The public announcement system inside the hotel issued an evacuation directive around 7:15 a.m. local time, and lawmakers and staff rushed outside, according to one of the people inside.",
      "\u201cThis morning, a threat was made against the safety of the members of the Texas House Democratic Caucus,\u201d three Texas state House Democrats said in a statement. \u201cWe are safe, we are secure, and we are undeterred and unintimidated. We are grateful for Governor Pritzker, local, and state law enforcement for their quick action to ensure our safety.\u201d",
      "About 400 people in all were evacuated, according to the St. Charles Police Department. The Kane County bomb squad was asked to assist and following a search, police said no device was found. The investigation continues, according to police.",
      "The Democratic legislators left Texas for Chicago, Boston and Albany, New York, on Sunday, after the Texas state legislature began a special session aimed at, among other things, drawing a new congressional map giving Republicans a path to a 5-seat gain in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Republicans are protecting a narrow 3-seat majority in the chamber ahead of the midterms."

      "The facility, which opened in July, is erected on an airstrip in the heart of the Florida Everglades inside the Big Cypress National Preserve in Ochopee, Florida. The facility was opened amid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal migrants and arrests that have led to overcrowding in Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.",
      "Environmental groups filed a June lawsuit to halt the facility\u2019s operations, claiming it was built without mandatory ecological reviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act. The suit also claims the center was built without public notice or comment and in compliance with other state and federal statutes, including the Endangered Species Act.",
      "The Everglades is a marshy habitat for endangered and threatened species like the Florida panther, the Florida bonneted bat, the Everglade Snail kite, the wood stork, and other species, according to the suit.",
      "The construction of the controversial facility also sparked protests in June by environmental activists and Native Americans advocating for their ancestral homelands."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said he was doubling tariffs on India from 25% to 50%.",
      "In an executive order, Trump says \"I find that the Government of India is currently directly or indirectly importing Russian Federation oil\" and due to those purchases, imports of Indian goods into the United States \"shall be subject to an additional ... rate of duty of 25%.\"",
      "The order says that the newly announced 25% will stack on top of the 25% Trump says he will hit India with on Wednesday night, when his sweeping global tariffs go into effect on most U.S. trading partners. The additional rate will take effect within 21 days.",
      "A 50% tariff on India would be among the highest on any trading partner in the world. The only countries with tariffs as high as India's is set to be are Brazil at 50%, Syria at 41%, Myanmar at 40% and Switzerland's which is set at 39%.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump told CNBC, \"India has not been a good trading partner, because they do a lot of business with us, but we don't do business with them. So we settled on 25% [tariffs] but I think I'm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they're buying Russian oil. They're fueling the war machine.\"",
      "India has previously said that it bought Russian oil with U.S. support.",
      "On Wednesday, India responded to Trump's newest tariffs, saying in a statement that \"these actions are unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\" The country's Ministry of External Affairs added that \"India will take all actions necessary to protect its national interests.\"",
      "At the time of the announcement, U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff was in Russia and met with President Vladimir Putin according to images released by state TV.",
      "Trump has also been unhappy with companies recently pivoting their supply chains from China, which for a time he had 145% tariffs on, to other countries like India.",
      "In a May social media post, Trump said \"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone\u2019s that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else.\"",
      "India was the tenth-largest source of goods imports into the United States in 2024, according to Commerce Dept. data. Consumers and businesses imported more than $87 billion worth of products.",
      "Some of the top imports from India include glass, metals, chemicals, plastic, rubber, machinery and mechanical equipment and farm goods.",
      "Apple is set to announce an investment in the U.S. later Wednesday. Most of Apple's most popular products are currently exempt from tariffs while the Commerce Dept. conducts a so-called Section 232 investigation. The investigation is seeking to determine the national security impact of importing those products and their parts.",
      "Despite the exemptions, Apple took an $800 million hit in the last quarter and predicted it will take another $1.5 billion hit in the next three months.",
      "Apple CEO Tim Cook will appear with Trump at the White House today for that announcement, an official told NBC News.",
      "Last quarter, India produced 44% of U.S. smartphone imports, more than any other country, including China, according to data from the research firm Canalys reported by Bloomberg. That includes iPhones sold in the U.S., the majority of which Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in May will have India as their country of origin starting this quarter.",
      "The shift in Trump's relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been swift. Modi was the fourth foreign leader to visit Trump in the White House in his second term.",
      "After Trump began his global trade war in April, for weeks White House advisers often mentioned that a trade agreement with India could be the first such agreement reached. The first trade agreement ended up going to the United Kingdom."

      "LONDON \u2014 British regulators criticized on Wednesday both sides in a dispute over the future of a charity founded by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, for allowing the issue to be played out in public and damaging the organization\u2019s reputation.",
      "The Charity Commission for England and Wales went on to say that it found no evidence of widespread bullying or misogyny at Sentebale, which provides support for young people living with HIV in Botswana and Lesotho.",
      "The commission opened a review of Sentebale\u2019s governance in April after the two princes stepped down as patrons and a group of trustees, saying the relationship between the board and its chair, Sophie Chandauka, was beyond repair. Chandauka later accused Harry of orchestrating a campaign of bullying and harassment to try to force her out.",
      "Disagreements over the organization\u2019s future surfaced in 2023 after the then-board of trustees sought to roll out a new fundraising strategy in the United States, the commission said. The dispute between Chandauka, other trustees and Harry was first reported to the commission in February 2025.",
      "Those tensions became public in March, when Harry announced he was stepping down as patron to support the trustees who had resigned. In his role as patron, the prince used his star power to promote and raise funds for Sentebale.",
      "\u201cSentebale\u2019s problems played out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity\u2019s reputation, risk overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardizing the charity\u2019s ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to serve,\u201d commission CEO David Holdsworth said in a statement released Wednesday.",
      "Harry\u2019s spokesman attacked the commission\u2019s decision.",
      "The report \u201cfalls troublingly short in many regards, primarily the fact that the consequences of the current chair\u2019s actions will not be borne by her \u2014 but by the children who rely on Sentebale\u2019s support,\u201d Harry\u2019s spokesman said in a statement.",
      "Harry will now look at alternative ways to help young people in Botswana and Lesotho, the spokesman said.",
      "Chandauka welcomed the report, saying it confirmed the governance issues she raised earlier this year.",
      "\u201cThe unexpected adverse media campaign that was launched by those who resigned on 24 March 2025 has caused incalculable damage and offers a glimpse of the unacceptable behaviors displayed in private,\u201d she said in a statement.",

      "Democrats in America's two biggest blue states are hatching plans to respond in kind to a mid-decade move by Texas to draw a friendlier House map for Republicans.",
      "Retaliation threats have come from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who lead states where Democrats control large legislative majorities. Two can play at this game, they say, vowing to similarly eliminate GOP-held seats in their states.",
      "But that's easier said than done.",
      "Democrats have legal hurdles to clear in California and New York, which have restricted partisan gerrymandering, which liberal advocates pushed in previous years in the name of good government. Texas has no such limits, so GOP Gov. Greg Abbott has called a special session to draw a new map.",
      "California eyes a 'triggered' map for 2026",
      "California has an independent redistricting commission \u2014 a bipartisan panel tasked with drawing up fair maps for the Legislature to approve \u2014 to avoid partisan influence. Newsom is seeking to get around that on a temporary and targeted basis \u2014 but only if Texas enacts its GOP-favored map, which is aimed at giving Republicans up to five more seats in the U.S. House.",
      "Newsom hopes to work with the Democratic-dominated Legislature starting this month to set up a special election for a statewide ballot measure on Nov. 4. It would offer a newly drawn map if Texas moves forward, a source close to Newsom told NBC News.",
      "The ballot measure would do two things: First, it would affirm support for California\u2019s independent commission and call for fair redistricting nationwide. Second, it would include a trigger that says a pre-drawn new House map expected to boost Democrats would take effect if Texas implemented a new map.",
      "\u201cWhat we will say is for the \u201926, \u201928 and 2030 elections, these congressional maps on the ballot that voters are approving will be in place. ... The maps themselves will most likely be on the ballot,\u201d said the source close to Newsom, who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the plan publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cAfter the 2030 election, the redistricting commission does its job again, and we\u2019ll redraw starting in 2032.\u201d",
      "Newsom said that the maps are \u201cbeing processed\u201d and that they will be \u201cprovided in a transparent way to the public,\u201d adding that under the plan, California voters would make the \u201cultimate determination.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to roll over. And we\u2019re going to fight fire with fire,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe also will punch above our weight in terms of the impact of what we\u2019re doing. And I think that should be absorbed by those in the Texas delegation. Whatever they are doing will be neutered here in the state of California.\u201d",
      "Paul Mitchell, a California-based redistricting consultant who has advised Democrats, said any new House map would be constrained by the Voting Rights Act, as well as the governor's office and the Legislature, which would need to greenlight it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like having an emergency \u2018break glass\u2019 rather than an emergency \u2018burn down the house\u2019 measure,\u201d Mitchell said, adding that voters support the independent commission and believe it should be replicated nationwide, in an ideal world.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re angry about what Texas is doing. They want to fight back,\u201d he said. \u201cVoters can understand our long-term goal is this path of better democracy. If we do something, it\u2019s only because Texas did it. If Texas steps down today, then all this hubbub of redistricting in California goes away.\u201d",
      "How many Republican-held House seats could Democrats flip by drawing a new and friendlier map in California?",
      "\u201cThe threshold is three, four or five seats,\u201d Mitchell said, adding that a tangential goal would be to fortify Democrats in existing competitive seats and not do a \u201cdummy-mander\u201d that might expose other Democratic lawmakers to problems.",
      "New York may have to wait until 2028",
      "In New York, changing the redistricting process must move forward as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment \u2014 a lengthy and arduous exercise that probably wouldn't lead to new congressional maps until the 2028 election cycle, even if Texas acts before the upcoming midterms.",
      "\u201cI wish I could just call a special election and change it. I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat,\u201d Hochul said recently on MSNBC\u2019s \"All In with Chris Hayes.\" \u201cBut we have a constitutional amendment process that\u2019s required first. I\u2019m willing to do that. I\u2019m working hard with our legislative leaders to pass legislation immediately \u2014 as soon as they return in January \u2014 pass it in this current session of the Legislature, go to the next one, which is required, so it won\u2019t be until 2027 we can get it on the ballot. But what would that mean \u2014 is that in 2028, we could have different lines.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s because the state's redistricting has been controlled for more than a decade by its own independent redistricting commission. New York voters passed a constitutional amendment changing the redistricting process back in 2014 to create the commission; previously, the Legislature controlled the entire process for legislative and congressional maps.",
      "The new proposed amendment would return the duties of redrawing congressional districts to the Legislature \u2014 but only if another state engaged in mid-decade redistricting first. Because it\u2019s a proposed constitutional amendment, it would have to pass the Legislature in Albany in two consecutive sessions \u2014 this year and again in 2026 \u2014 and then still be approved by voters in a ballot measure in the subsequent year.",
      "That means that whatever new maps that would be created wouldn\u2019t be in effect until the 2028 elections at the earliest.",
      "\u201cOtherwise, we have to wait until 2032,\u201d Hochul said, referring to the decennial census process. \u201cAnd heaven help our country to find out what\u2019ll happen with that length of time.\u201d",
      "Democratic legislators in Albany acknowledged that the payoff would be delayed, but they said advancing the measure is still crucial, as long as Texas Republicans continue to advance their own.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still worth it,\u201d state Sen. Pat Fahy, a Democrat, told NBC News on the sidelines of the National Conference of State Legislatures annual meeting in Boston on Tuesday.",
      "Fahy said it was \u201creally unfortunate\u201d that New York Democrats felt forced to change years of precedent. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to do it, because so much is at stake,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about Congress, and it is about control, and it\u2019s unfortunate, but we have to do what we have to do.\u201d",
      "Responding to questions about the obstacles and delays, state Senate Deputy Majority Leader Michael Gianaris, who introduced the bill in his chamber, said in an email, \u201cWhat Texas is attempting is a perversion of our democracy and cannot be allowed to stand without a response.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis battle will not be over in 2026 and it behooves us to ensure New York is in the game if other states will be enacting off-cycle redistricting,\u201d he said."

      "Portland International Airport\u2019s (PDX) new main terminal opened in late 2024 with a speakeasy, regular visits from therapy llamas and a soaring 9-acre wood-beamed ceiling that inspired a rap song. The $19 billion makeover underway at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York includes two new terminals and modernizations of the two existing terminals. New Terminal One, which will be JFK\u2019s largest terminal, will open in phases beginning in 2026 and include more than 300,000 square feet of dining, retail, lounge and recreational space.",

Its commercial offerings are intended to reflect life in New York, with regular pop-ups and eight lounges, including Capital One\u2019s largest lounge to date.",
      "While many airport upgrades reflect expected growth in passenger traffic and some long-delayed infrastructure investments, the \u201cpremiumization\u201d of many services and the flurry of new lounges may be a response to airports being \u2014 or feeling \u2014 more crowded. Travelers have been willing to open their wallets to improve their experience and feel \u201cspecial.\u201d",
      "At many airports, the experience on the concourse is nice enough that you don\u2019t need to access a lounge to have robust Wi-Fi, power outlets, comfortable seating, pleasant surroundings and plentiful concessions, said travel analyst Henry Harteveldt, president and founder of Atmosphere Research.",
      "Yet 14% of the 5,000 U.S. airline passengers his group surveyed earlier this year said they have access to airport lounges through paid memberships, qualifying credit cards or flights, and spend status with an airline, said Harteveldt.",
      "\u201cWe all want something that not everybody else has. And these lounges also appeal to the innate snob in all of us,\" Harteveldt said. \"In some cases, the lounges are above the general concourse area, meaning you are literally looking down on the people in the main terminal area.\"",
      "In a recent survey of more than 10,000 global travelers who take two or more trips a year, airport lounge operator Airport Dimensions found that 66% of U.S. travelers said they\u2019d be willing to purchase premium services such as priority check in, fast-track lanes, paid waiting areas and lounge access to improve their airport experience.",
      "The survey found that so-called affluent leisure travelers were significantly more willing to pay for those premium services than others. These travelers, also known as ALTs, are defined in part as taking three or more trips a year.",
      "\u201cThese are people traveling by choice, not just necessity,\u201d said Chris Gwilliam, Airport Dimensions\u2019 senior vice president of global business. \u201cAnd they are willing to spend when the experience feels worth it.\u201d",
      "Those with big budgets who want an even more premium experience can access luxury terminals when flying commercial from some airports.",
      "PS, which opened a private, gated terminal for affluent travelers at Los Angeles International Airport in 2017, opened a second one  at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Georgia in 2023. It plans openings for airports in Dallas/Fort Worth and Miami in 2026.",
      "Services include private security screening, on-site customs and immigration facilities, spa services, chef-prepared meals, private suites or shared private lounge access and chauffeur service to the airplane. Fees range from $1,295 for individual access to close to $5,000 for a private suite for up to four travelers.",
      "Demand for private travel experiences has skyrocketed since the pandemic along with a general desire to splurge on travel, said Amina Belouizdad Porter, CEO of PS. \u201cIt\u2019s a trend that we have benefited from.\u201d",
      "Even less than affluent flyers are ponying up.",
      "SkySquad is a service that expedites check-in and escorts travelers from the curb to the gate, with prices from $79 (walk-up) to $149 (prebooked) for up to six people at a growing number of airports, The Bethesda, Maryland-based company had its busiest month ever in December at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL), where the company can only service customers of Spirit Airlines, an ultra-low-cost carrier.",
      "\u201cWe helped over 2,900 groups at FLL that month, which shows that travelers across all price points value a VIP experience,\u201d said company founder Julie Melnick.",
      "There are other widely available ways to get preferential treatment. The expedited screening lane accessible with TSA Precheck is available at more than 200 airports.

Plus, I find that enamel-coated cast-iron pots work best for soups and stews, since they simmer faster and more evenly.

      "\u201cOnions are naturally antimicrobial while rich in sulfur and antioxidants so there is truth in onion being potentially helpful as an ingredient in hair products,\u201d says Dr. Anna Chacon, a board-certified dermatologist in Miami, Florida. Because of this, there are a number of shampoos on the market that list onion extract as one of their primary ingredients.",
      "Below, we spoke to experts about the potential benefits associated with onion shampoo, whether you can use it if you have color-treated hair and more \u2014 plus, gathered a few highly rated options for you to shop.",
      "What is onion shampoo?",
      "Onion shampoo is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 shampoo that has onion as a main ingredient. Though it may sound funky, the experts we spoke to agree that onion extract can help hair health. \u201cOnion contains sulfur, which is a key building block for keratin, the protein that makes up your hair,\u201d says Dr. Ross Kopelman, a hair transplant surgeon at Kopelman Hair Restoration. \u201cIt also has antimicrobial properties that can support a healthier scalp environment. Some studies suggest it may increase blood flow to the scalp and reduce inflammation, which are both important for hair health.\u201d",
      "Most commonly, hair products with this vegetable are aimed at helping with hair thinning and encouraging growth. One clinical trial even found that when onion extract was applied topically, it helped people with alopecia areata (an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss) with regrowth. \u201cWhile we need more research, I\u2019ve seen some patients benefit when using onion-based treatments as part of a broader hair care routine,\u201d says Kopelman.",
      "The perks may sound great, but worried that onion shampoo will leave you smelling like the deli counter? Don\u2019t be. While onion extract may be a primary ingredient, the shampoos available that use it also have other beneficial (and pleasant-smelling) ingredients, such as lavender or rosemary.",
      "Can anyone use onion shampoo?",
      "In general, over-the-counter shampoos with onion extract are gentle and sulfate-free, so they should be safe for just about everyone to use. That said, if you have color-treated hair, you may want to think twice. \u201cOnions are acidic, so using them on color-treated hair can disrupt the delicate PH balance needed to prolong the look of freshly colored hair,\u201d says Chacon. \u201cAvoiding the shaft of the treated hair and concentrating at the scalp is an option but be sure to patch test to ensure you don\u2019t have any scalp sensitivity.\u201d",
      "Chacon also recommends that those with sensitive skin proceed with caution. \u201cThe smell could also be a hindrance here as well as the effect onions have on the eyes and the close proximity of the scalp to the eyes,\u201d says Chacon. \u201cInstead, I would opt for rosemary oil \u2014 which is an alternative natural ingredient that has all of the antifungal, growth promoting effects but with a pleasant scent.\u201d",
      "Finally, if you are allergic to anything in the allium family (like onions or garlic), it\u2019s best to skip this type of shampoo. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few cases of contact dermatitis from poorly formulated onion shampoos,\u201d says Kopelman. \u201cAlso, if you have eczema or active scalp inflammation, it\u2019s best to consult with a specialist before adding anything new to your regimen.\u201d",

      "Using her sleuthing skills and inherited psychic abilities, Wednesday devotes her days at the academy to trying to solve a murder.",
      "In the Season 1 finale, Wednesday's suspicions are confirmed. Her classmate and love interest, Tyler (Hunter Doohan), is really a short-tempered murderous Hyde monster, and he's been behind a series of violent attacks.",
      "But Tyler wasn't acting alone. The Hyde's master turns out to be botany teacher Marilyn Thornhill, whose real name in the show is Laurel Gates (Christina Ricci).",
      "At the end of the season, Laurel's longstanding revenge plot to eliminate all outcasts is unveiled. Laurel is a descendant of  Joseph Crackstone, who attempted to wipe out all outcasts in Jericho, where Nevermore is located. Following her familial pursuit, Laurel used the Hyde to kill off as many outcasts as she could, while simultaneously collecting body parts to resurrect Crackstone.",
      "Because Wednesday is a descendant of Goody Addams, who played a significant role in Crackstone's death, the final step of Laurel's plan was to obtain Wednesday's blood.",
      "Once she has her blood, Laurel brings back Crackstone. Then, using their powers as outcasts, all of Nevermore backs Wednesday to ultimately defeat Laurel, Crackstone and the Hyde.",
      "Though the Crackstone case wraps up in the finale, Wednesday's life remains complicated. In the final scene of Season 1, Wednesday receives her first cell phone and immediately get threatening messages from an unknown contact, with a final text reading, \u201cI\u2019m watching you.\u201d",

      "Instead, Wednesday avoids involving Enid in her murder investigation \u2014 though the werewolf is almost too occupied with a love triangle between Ajax (Georgie Farmer) and Bruno (Noah B. Taylor) to notice.",
      "Accompanied by a new accomplice, Agnes DeMille (Evie Templeton), whom she first suspects is her stalker, Wednesday takes her investigation to Willow Hill, a psychiatric ward. That's where Laurel is held and Tyler is being treated.",

      "How Does \u2018Wednesday\u2019 Season 2, Part 1 End?",

      "Upon seeing Laurel, Tyler transforms into the Hyde and nearly kills his master before letting her go. Laurel later tells Dr. Fairburn that he wouldn't have killed her because a Hyde killing a master secures its doom.",

      "As a patient at the psych ward, Fester is on the lookout for a person named Lois, per Wednesday\u2019s instructions. But after Laurel spots Fester and notifies the staff of his connection to the Addams family, he's locked up in Willow Hill's prison.",
      "Using the blueprints Agnes had found, Wednesday crafts a plan to break in to Willow Hill for answers. She puts Enid, who begs to be involved in the scheme, on lookout duty.",

      "In a stairwell, they find the word LOIS painted on the wall, only to realize LOIS isn't a name but an acronym: Longterm Outcast Integration Study. As they wander further, they find a room of prison cells each holding outcasts.",

      "Judi says she hired Dr. Fairburn to be the face of the institute while she continued the work of her father, Augustus Stonehurst. He attempted to extract the powers of the outcasts and make them accessible to \u201cnormies,\u201d or people without powers.",
      "Judi is continuing his legacy, saying she was also born a normie and now has an army of crows at her beck and call. When Fester tries to electrocute her, his powers can't reach her but they do turn off the building's electric system and unlock all outcasts' cells. The outcasts then attack Judi, allowing Wednesday and Fester to escape.",
      "Amid the chaos, Wednesday guides one of the outcasts to safety while Laurel escapes her own chains and frees Tyler. But Laurel's plan backfires and the Hyde impales her with his claws, seemingly killing her.",
      "Attempting to bring a patient to safety in her office, Dr. Fairburn is fatally attacked by a zombie, who also kills the patient.",
      "As Wednesday travels the dark hallways of the psych ward, the Hyde finds her. Suddenly Wednesday is thrown out of a second story window.",
      "The final moments of Part 1 see Wednesday laying bloodied and unconscious in the rain, surrounded by police, as the Hyde escapes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always dreamed of looking death in the face. But in my final moments all I hear is my mother\u2019s words ringing in my ears,\" Wednesday says in a voiceover. \"Maybe I have made everything worse. Much worse.\""

      "In the U.S., 90% of patients who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest do not survive.",
      "Also known as a heart attack, acute myocardial infarction refers to when the heart or parts of the heart are not getting enough blood flow, usually due to a blockage in an artery. A heart attack can lead to a sudden cardiac arrest.",
      "Coronary artery disease is a type of heart disease that leads to reduced blood flow to the heart. A common cause is fats, cholesterol and other substances building up in the arteries and along their walls. It takes many years to develop.",
      "Parkinson's is a degenerative brain condition that causes balance problems, shaking, difficulty moving and more. Symptoms worsen over time. In addition to affecting motor skills, it can harm the autonomic nervous system, which regulates involuntary bodily functions, like breathing, digestion and heart rate.",

    "story": [
      "Beloved National Hockey League mascot Buoy may rule the rink, but in bear country, he's skating on thin ice.",
      "In a video posted to X, the Seattle Kraken mascot joined forward John Hayden on a fishing adventure. The two are dressed in fishing gear and standing in a river when a brown bear emerges from the trees and approaches the water\u2019s edge.",
      "The brush with nature happened while the troll and Hayden were taking part in a youth hockey summer camp program in Anchorage, Alaska, according to a post shared by the ice hockey team on X.",
      "\"TROLL NARROWLY ESCAPES BEAR ENCOUNTER,\" the post's caption reads. \"*No trolls or bears were hurt in the making, always respect wildlife in their natural habitat.\"",
      "The dramatic 51-second clip begins with Buoy standing beside Hayden, who tells the camera there was a close encounter with a bear during the trip.",
      "The footage cuts back to earlier in the trip, showing Hayden using a fishing reel when someone off-camera warns, \u201cWe got a bear.\u201d Over Hayden's shoulder, the bear can be seen stepping into the water.",
      "\"Oh my God,\" someone says. \"We've got to move down.\"",
      "Hayden hands off his fishing reel to a crew member, and the group cautiously begins moving to put distance between themselves and the bear.",
      "The camera follows Buoy and Hayden as they calmly wade farther into the water \u2014 just as the bear lets out a ferocious growl. Seconds later, the bear breaks into a sprint, charging at Buoy before suddenly backing off.",
      "\u201cI want to blame it on Buoy. They were pretty interested in his whole look,\u201d Hayden says later in the video about the encounter. \u201cWe got out of it OK, but it was a close call.\u201d",
      "The comments section on the video post had no shortage of jokes over the run-in.",
      "\"If you see Buoy and a bear in the wild, HELP THE BEAR!\" the official account for the Los Angeles Rams mascot, Rampage, quipped.",
      "\"Typical Boston fan in the wild,\" another joked.",
      "\"BUOY WAS STANDING ON BUSINESS,\" chimed in another. \"HE WAS NOT INTIMIDATED BY THE BEAR.\"",
      "How to tell the difference between brown and black bears?",
      "Alaska is home to three species of bears: black bears, polar bears and brown bears (which include the grizzly bear subspecies), according to the National Park Service (NPS).",
      "The brown bear in the video is easy to distinguish from a polar bear by coat color. However, telling a brown bear from a black bear is trickier since both can have brown coats. Their key differences lie in their size and physical features. Brown bears and grizzly bears have a noticeable muscular hump between their shoulders, longer claws and smaller ears, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.",
      "You might have heard the adage \"Brown, lie down. Black fight back.\" In the case of a brown bear encounter, NPS advises remaining calm \u2014 as Buoy and Hayden do in the video \u2014 and, if necessary, lying on the ground and playing dead. Black bears, however, should be approached differently if they become aggressive. NPS advises making yourself look larger, shouting, and fighting back with what\u2019s available to you in the area."

      "It\u2019s almost time to return to Nevermore Academy.",
      "It\u2019s been nearly two years since we last saw Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) arrive with no patience for small talk and a knack for uncovering secrets no one asked her to find.",
      "\u201cWednesday,\u201d an Addams family spin-off, is a supernatural coming-of-age mystery series executive produced by Tim Burton.",
      "The show follows Wednesday Addams, the deadpan, macabre daughter of Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Gomez Addams (Luis Guzm\u00e1n). After being expelled from her \u201cnormie\u201d high school for an incident involving piranhas and the water polo team, she\u2019s sent to Nevermore Academy, a boarding school for supernatural \u201coutcasts.\u201d",
      "There, she crosses paths with her pastel-clad werewolf roommate Enid (Emma Myers), aloof psychic Xavier (Percy Hynes White), and barista-slash-sheriff\u2019s son Tyler (Hunter Doohan). Wednesday quickly discovers she has emerging psychic powers \u2026 and that something monstrous is stalking both the school and the nearby town of Jericho.",
      "Between fencing class, forced therapy and her own deeply rooted trust issues, Wednesday launches her own investigation. But what starts as a classic whodunit, soon unravels into a story about prophecy, resurrection, and a plot centuries in the making.",
      "Here's what to remember from Season 1 ahead of the show's Season 2 return Aug. 6.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s visions reveal a deadly prophecy",
      "Wednesday\u2019s visions begin after a classmate named Rowan (Calum Ross) tries to kill her in the woods, convinced she\u2019s destined to destroy Nevermore. His proof? A prophetic drawing from his mother, a powerful seer, that depicts Wednesday surrounded by flames as the school burns. Before he can follow through, Rowan is killed by a monstrous creature.",
      "The next day, he shows up at school \u2026 alive. Or so it seems. Wednesday soon discovers that Principal Weems (Gwendoline Christie), a shapeshifter, impersonated Rowan to cover up his death and avoid panic. As more attacks surface in Jericho, Wednesday learns the creature is a Hyde: a once-human monster triggered by trauma and controlled by a hidden master.",
      "Her psychic visions, triggered by touch, begin connecting her to a long-dead ancestor named Goody Addams \u2014 and a prophecy that suggests the destruction of Nevermore may start with her.",
      "The Hyde's Identity Is Revealed",
      "As the killings continue, Wednesday becomes convinced the monster is someone at Nevermore. Her suspicions land on Xavier, especially after discovering sketches of the creature in his studio. But after a tense date with Tyler, she kisses him \u2014 and the contact triggers a vision that reveals the truth: he is the Hyde.",
      "It\u2019s a painful discovery. Tyler had gained her trust, but he had been hiding who he was the entire time. And worse, someone else is commanding him.",
      "Laurel Gates Is Alive",
      "That someone is Laurel Gates, sister of the late Garrett Gates \u2014 a former Nevermore student whose death still lingers in the town\u2019s history. Laurel faked her death years ago and returned under a new name: Miss Thornhill (Christina Ricci), the friendly botany teacher and Nevermore\u2019s only \u201cnormie\u201d staff member.",
      "Laurel is the Hyde\u2019s master and orchestrates the murder of several key characters, including Coroner Reggie (Nitin Ganatra), Mayor Walker (Tommie Earl Jenkins), and Principal Weems. She manipulates Tyler and uses Wednesday\u2019s blood to resurrect Joseph Crackstone (William Houston), a Pilgrim-era zealot who once vowed to wipe out all outcasts. In the finale, she succeeds \u2026 briefly.",
      "Nevermore\u2019s Fall",
      "In the season finale, all hell breaks loose. Crackstone returns from the dead and stabs Wednesday, nearly killing her. But she is saved by Goody Addams\u2019 spirit and a protective necklace passed down by her mother.",
      "Meanwhile, Enid finally transforms into a werewolf for the first time and takes down Tyler. Bianca Barclay (Joy Sunday), once her rival, helps Wednesday destroy Crackstone once and for all. And Eugene (Moosa Mostafa), one of Wednesday\u2019s few genuine friends, wakes from a coma and arrives just in time to unleash his bees on Laurel.",
      "With the villains defeated, Nevermore closes for the semester. But the danger isn\u2019t gone. In the final scene, Wednesday receives a text from an anonymous number with photos of her and a chilling message: \u201cI\u2019m watching you.\u201d"

      "In \u201cThe Summer I Turned Pretty\u201d Season 3, the parents of Belly (Lola Tung), Steven (Sean Kaufman), Conrad (Christopher Briney), Jeremiah (Gavin Casalegno) and Taylor (Rain Spencer) deal with the universal theme of empty-nesting as the beloved summer crew go to college and beyond.",
      "Laurel Park (Jackie Chung), Belly and Steven Conklin's mom, continues to grieve the loss of best friend Susannah Fisher (Rachel Blanchard), who died in Season 2. Meanwhile Susannah\u2019s husband, Adam Fisher (Tom Everett Scott), struggles to step up for his two sons, Conrad and Jeremiah Fisher. Season 3 also introduces viewers to Taylor\u2019s mom, Lucinda Jewel (Kristen Connolly).",

Now upperclassmen in college with around four years of dating under their belt, the young lovebirds get engaged after Steven\u2019s car accident, which for Belly, puts their blowout fight over Jeremiah sleeping with someone else into a new perspective.",

      "\"With her kids gone, she has an opportunity to look around and see what's out there, and see what her life can be and look for new relationships,\" she adds. \"There's a lot of potential for Laurel.\"",
      "When it comes to parenting, she says in Season 2, \"Laurel wasn't always the best communicator.\" That was Susannah's strong suit. Chung says Laurel strives to step up to that task after Susannah's death.",
      "\"Laurel is trying really hard to communicate with her kids and Susannah's kids, and just trying to be the best parent she can be,\" she says. \"She doesn't always succeed, and she butts heads with her kids sometimes, but you know, it's all out of love.\"",
      "After Belly and Jeremiah announce their engagement over dinner in Episode 3, Laurel immediately criticizes the decision and storms out, shutting the meal down before it even begins.",
      "Chung says Laurel's overall goal is to \"set them up for success as individuals in their lives and (help them make) good decisions for themselves.\"",

      "Adam was also at that fateful dinner in Episode 3. In fact, the engagement announcement came about after he made an underhanded remark about Jeremiah being a \"super senior.\" Belly, wanting to prove that she and Jeremiah are taking their future plans seriously, then reveals they are getting married.",
      "Like Laurel, he calls Jeremiah \u201cirresponsible\" and helps shut down the dinner before appetizers hit the table.",
      "Adam has never exactly been father of the year. When Susannah got sick, he was MIA. After she passed, he stayed emotionally checked out, and in Season 2, he refused to help save the family beach house until Laurel pressured him into doing it.",
      "\u201cPeople say that Adam actually stepped up... but it was really Laurel who kind of forced his hand,\u201d Scott tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut I love that scene because you see a little crack in Adam. He does get to kind of show that he\u2019s hurting and he\u2019s missing Susannah.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re sort of parent daughter relationship is switched, like Taylor feels more like the parent a bit, which is an interesting dynamic that\u2019s funny and presents its own challenges,\u201d Spencer tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cBeing a young adult (is) like, \u2018How much do I help my mom, versus listen to my heart and what I want to do and leave the nest?\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "When Taylor comes home for summer break, Lucinda greets her with a freshly cleaned house, a breakup playlist and plans to binge watch \u201cGilmore Girls.\u201d Taylor divulges her boy drama, and in classic TV mom fashion, Lucinda schemes. She calls Steven, pretending to need bookkeeping help, but the plan backfires. Steven finds out Lucinda's salon is bleeding cash and might not last the month.",
      "By the end of the episode, Lucinda crumbles, crying in front of Taylor. Her response seemingly sets the stage for their arc in Season 3: \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out together.\u201d",
      "A Loss No One Can Forget",
      "While Susannah Fisher may be gone, her presence is felt everywhere.",
      "From the first scene of Season 3, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s still the emotional center of the show. Her death fractured the core group and sent each parent, and kid, on their own winding path through grief, growth and messy healing.",
      "\u201cShe was Laurel\u2019s biggest cheerleader and an instigator,\u201d Chung says. \u201cThe one who throws a party, who says, \u2018Come on, Laurel, let\u2019s dance.\u2019\u201d",
      "Her absence is felt in the quiet moments \u2014 Belly reaching for someone to guide her, Laurel learning how to open up and Adam trying to fill her shoes as a single parent. The memorial garden dedication in her name in Episode 3 brings the whole group back together, and it\u2019s her legacy that both unites and complicates them.",
      "Plus, there's a chance we'll continue to see more of Susannah in Season 3. The official X account for \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" shared photos of Rachel Blanchard on set, though it was unclear if she filmed scenes for the third season."

      "Speaking to People in a recent interview, the 57-year-old actor explained that he relocated from Los Angeles soon after the final season of the beloved sitcom wrapped in 2020. Since then, he has been living with his wife, Holly Burrell, and their two teenage daughters, Frances and Greta, in Salt Lake City, which he described as \u201cspectacular.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have any regrets,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s been lovely and a great place to raise the kids.\u201d",
      "The Emmy winner, who now stars in the podcast \u201cThe Good Life,\u201d noted that while he\u2019s eager to return to performing, his work on the scripted series allows him to lean into a lifestyle with an open door to nature \u2014 a plot twist that\u2019s surprising even for him, given that he wasn\u2019t always interested in the outdoors.",
      "\u201cMy parents weren\u2019t really those kinds of people,\u201d he explained of his childhood. \u201cSo at first, when we moved here, it almost felt like cosplay, like we were pretending to be people who were outdoorsy, and now we really, truly love it.\u201d",
      "The actor, who has been married to his wife for 25 years, says the strength of their partnership likely benefits from a commonly suggested rule of thumb for relationships: \u201cDon\u2019t go to bed angry.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe force ourselves to talk about stuff,\u201d he shared. \u201cBoth of us make sure that if something\u2019s wrong, by the end of the night, we have at least had some discussion about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cNeither one of us are silent treatment people,\u201d he added. \"And I think that\u2019s a real benefit, because I think that can be really hard on a relationship, when you don\u2019t talk about things.\u201d",
      "Burrell and his wife adopted both of their daughters, starting with Frances in 2010 and then Greta in 2012. Soon after adopting Frances, the actor spoke to E! News and reflected on his \u201cModern Family\u201d character Phil Dunphy and his influence on his own real-life parenting style.",
      "\u201cI do love how much he tries, you know what I mean?\u201d Burrell said at the time. \u201cI hope I can try as hard as Phil. Maybe not quite as hard as Phil, but I hope I can try.\u201d"

      "On Wednesday, people in Hiroshima commemorated the 80th anniversary of the devastating attack, as nuclear fears mount globally amid unresolved military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "In a one-minute silent tribute, the city remembered the widescale death and destruction caused by the 10,000-pound bomb, which created a huge mushroom cloud that rose to more than 60,000 feet.",
      "\u201cIt is our duty to convey the reality of the atomic bombings not only to the people of Japan but also to the people of the world,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in a speech.",
      "Initially meant to strike a T-shaped bridge, the bomb veered instead toward an exhibition hall with a distinctive dome, which after the explosion was the only building still standing within a 1-mile radius.",
      "The blast unleashed a whirlwind of fire and force, incinerating thousands of people. Then came the radioactive black rain, which fell over the city, silently poisoning countless more.",
      "Teruko Yahata was 8 years old at the time.",
      "Yahata, who is now in her 80s, says she still has a scar from when she was hurled by the blast. Fearing another bomb, she huddled under a blanket with her family.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really understand what it meant to die,\u201d Yahata said, \u201cbut the warmth I felt at us dying together \u2026 I still remember to this day.\u201d",
      "Three days after bombing Hiroshima, the U.S. unleashed a second atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki that killed another 40,000 people immediately.",
      "The unprecedented bombings hastened Imperial Japan\u2019s surrender and the end of World War II, most historians say, though at the price of nearly a quarter-million lives.",
      "From the ashes, Hiroshima was rebuilt into a busy city of more than a million people, drawing tourists from around the world.",
      "Near the hypocenter, where the bomb detonated about 2,000 feet above, is a peace memorial park and museum that includes the iconic atomic dome. Using virtual reality headsets, visitors can immerse themselves in the bombing and its brutal aftermath while touring the park.",
      "Yet, the bombing still feels visceral to Hiroshima survivors, who are called hibakusha, or \u201cbomb affected persons.\u201d Now more than 86 years old on average, they have spent most of their lives struggling with illness, depression and discrimination.",
      "Kunihiko Iida, whose father was killed in the war and whose mother and older sister died shortly after the bombing, is now 83, defying predictions that he would not live to the age of 20.",

      "The increase in spending on nuclear weapons contrasts with public attitudes about them. In a June survey of Americans by the Pew Research Center, 69% of respondents said the development of nuclear weapons had made the world less safe, compared with 10% who said it had made the world safer.",
      "Nearly 70% of Japan\u2019s atomic bomb survivors believe nuclear weapons could be used again, according to a poll this year by Japanese news agency Kyodo News.",
      "Hiroshima survivor Setsuko Thurlow, 93, lost 10 members of her family in the bombing. She said she remembered seeing a procession of people fleeing to the hillside who \u201clooked like ghosts.\u201d",

      "The commission opened a review of Sentebale\u2019s governance in April after the two princes stepped down as patrons and a group of trustees, saying the relationship between the board and its chair, Sophie Chandauka, was beyond repair. Chandauka later accused Harry of orchestrating a campaign of bullying and harassment to try to force her out.",
      "Disagreements over the organization\u2019s future surfaced in 2023 after the then-board of trustees sought to roll out a new fundraising strategy in the United States, the commission said. The dispute between Chandauka, other trustees and Harry was first reported to the commission in February 2025.",
      "Those tensions became public in March, when Harry announced he was stepping down as patron to support the trustees who had resigned. In his role as patron, the prince used his star power to promote and raise funds for Sentebale.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to push to \"occupy all of the Gaza Strip\" as ceasefire talks with Hamas founder and the hunger crisis in the besieged Palestinian enclave spirals.",
      "A bid by Netanyahu to occupy all of Gaza would follow similar calls from members of his far-right government upon whom his fragile coalition relies, and could mark a significant shift in policy since Israel withdrew from the territory in 2005.",
      "Officials from Netanyahu's office said in a statement shared with NBC News on Monday night that the Israeli leader had decided to \"occupy all of the Gaza Strip, including areas where hostages may be held.\"",
      "The statement was shared in Hebrew and the term used can be translated to mean both \"occupy\" and \"conquer.\" Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on the intended definition, but Israeli media, including The Times of Israel, reported that Netanyahu intended to \"fully occupy\" the enclave.",
      "Israeli media reported that Netanyahu would hold a limited security meeting Tuesday to discuss the future of Israel's campaign in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu had said Monday he planned to convene the security Cabinet this week to \"instruct\" the Israeli military on how to achieve the three war objectives laid out at the start of Israel's offensive in Gaza: defeating Hamas, seeing the release of hostages who remain held in the enclave and removing the threat of possible future attacks. Asked to confirm if the meeting would take place Tuesday, his office did not respond directly and referred NBC News to his comments Monday.",
      "While the Hamas-led attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, that left 1,200 dead and saw 250 taken hostages garnered worldwide sympathy for Israel, the country's actions in the territory have since sparked widespread international outrage.",
      "The United States remains the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, with American spending on Israel's military operations reaching more than $17.9 billion from Oct. 7 last year to Sept. 30, according to Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project.",
      "There has been growing global alarm over Israel\u2019s actions in the enclave amid a hunger crisis caused by the offensive and strict restrictions on the entry of aid, marked by mounting deaths from starvation.",
      "The \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201c is unfolding in the Gaza Strip under Israel\u2019s assault, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger said last week. Meanwhile, most of its residents have been driven from their homes and more than 60,900 killed, including thousands of children, according to local health officials.",
      "Nearly 190 people in Gaza, including at least 94 children, have died from malnutrition since the war began, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza.",
      "There is mounting opposition to the war among Israelis. Many have long despaired over the fate of of the estimated 20 living hostages remaining in Gaza, and recent protests have expressed outrage over the children dying from malnutrition.",
      "Fears for the hostages were also fueled after Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad released imagery in recent days showing visibly gaunt Israeli hostages Evyatar David and Rom Braslavski.",
      "Earlier this month, a group representing hundreds of retired Israeli security officials that calls itself the Commanders for Israel\u2019s Security\u2019s leadership addressed a letter to President Donald Trump calling on him to pressure Israel to end the war.",
      "In the letter, which was confirmed to NBC News, the group said it was its professional judgment that Hamas no longer posed a strategic threat \u2014 and that it was time to \u201cend the war, return the hostages\u201d and \u201cstop the suffering.\u201d",
      "While the reoccupation of Gaza is largely unpopular with the Israeli public, it is supported on the far right.",
      "Over the weekend, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza to and to encourage Palestinians to leave the enclave.",
      "Ben-Gvir drew condemnation not only for his comments, but also for leading a group of worshippers in prayer at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount, violating a decades-old agreement allowing Jews to visit to Jerusalem\u2019s most sensitive holy site but not to worship there.",
      "Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for Israel to \"conquer\" Gaza, and called for rebuilding of Israeli settlements there alongside other right-wing ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "Israel captured the Gaza Strip, then occupied by Egypt, after the 1967 war, but withdrew settlers \u2014 some of them forcefully \u2014 in 2005. In 2006, residents elected the Islamist militant and political group Hamas in legislative elections, precipitating clashes with the more secular Palestinian faction of Fatah.

      "\u201cNow, we think that we have to shift this negotiation to all or nothing. Everybody comes home,\u201d Witkoff says later in the recording of the meeting with hostage families, which was also reported on by The New York Times.",
      "Daniel Lifshitz said Witkoff had said the U.S. was looking to \u201cshift from partial deal to a full-scale deal,\u201d but did not expand on exactly how that would happen.",
      "\u201cHe spoke about shifting because there is nothing else to do now,\u201d Lifshitz told NBC News on Monday.  He said Witkoff spoke with hostage families for nearly three hours.",

      "At the start of the year, India seemed to be one of the countries most likely to win Trump\u2019s favor, given its growing role as an Asian counterweight to China and Trump\u2019s close relationship with its leader, Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "But U.S. relations with India have instead come under strain over trade and other issues. Trump has threatened Apple and other companies that manufacture in India; moved closer to its biggest rival, Pakistan; and mocked India\u2019s \u201cdead\u201d economy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s threatening to undo, or at least hit pause on, what has been two decades of steadily improving relations between India and the U.S.,\u201d said Dhruva Jaishankar, executive director of the Observer Research Foundation America, a nonprofit group in Washington.",
      "On Monday, citing India\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d purchases of Russian oil, Trump said he would \u201csubstantially\u201d increase the U.S. tariff on Indian imports, which is already one of the highest among Asian countries at 25%. Along with China, India is a top purchaser of Russian crude oil sanctioned by Western governments after Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "In a sharp response, India, a major U.S. security partner, said such criticism was \u201cunjustified and unreasonable\u201d and that it bought Russian oil with U.S. support.",
      "\u201cIndia began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict,\u201d the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe United States at that time actively encouraged such imports by India for strengthening global energy markets stability.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "U.S.-India tensions are mounting domestic political pressure on Modi, with opponents accusing him of failing to stand up to his \u201cdear friend\u201d Trump.",
      "\u201cThe country is now bearing the cost of Narendra Modi\u2019s \u2018friendship,\u2019\u201d the opposition Congress party said last week.",
      "\u2018I don\u2019t want you building in India\u2019",
      "It was a different picture in February, when Modi was among the first world leaders to visit the White House after Trump returned to office. Mirroring Trump, he said he too would \u201cmake India great again.\u201d",
      "The bonhomie did not last long. Since then, Trump has needled India over a number of issues, including billions in investment by American companies as they shift manufacturing from China.",
      "Last quarter, India produced 44% of U.S. smartphone imports, more than any other country, including China, according to data from the research firm Canalys. That includes iPhones sold in the U.S., the majority of which Apple chief executive Tim Cook says will have India as their country of origin starting this quarter.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want you building in India,\u201d Trump said he told Cook in May, urging him to produce phones in the U.S. instead, despite the difficulties.",
      "Cozying up to India\u2019s foe",
      "A terrorist attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 26 people in April is another source of friction in U.S.-India relations.",
      "India responded by bombing neighboring Pakistan, which it has long accused of harboring terrorists, resulting in a four-day conflict that threatened to explode into a broader war fueled by decades of tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries.",
      "Trump irked India by repeatedly claiming that he had personally brokered a ceasefire. While Islamabad thanked Trump for mediating, India rejected claims of U.S. involvement, including in a call between Modi and Trump.",
      "\u201cIndia has not endorsed Trump\u2019s claim,\u201d said Amitendu Palit, a former Indian finance ministry official and a senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore.",
      "\u201cThat has not gone down very well with Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "Within weeks, Trump hosted Pakistan\u2019s powerful army chief at the White House in an unprecedented meeting. He has also imposed a lower tariff rate on Pakistan of 19% and said the U.S. had reached a deal with Pakistan on exploring its oil reserves.",
      "Squeezed over Russia",
      "As Trump has expressed growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, he has turned his attention to India\u2019s relationship with Moscow.",
      "For years, New Delhi has benefited from its \u201cnonaligned\u201d foreign policy, which allowed India to strengthen U.S. ties while continuing its long-standing relationship with Russia, one of its main suppliers of energy and military equipment.",
      "When Russian oil was hit with Western-led sanctions over Ukraine, India \u2014 the third-largest energy consumer in the world after China and the U.S. \u2014 seized the opportunity to buy it at a discount, which even U.S. officials said helped stabilize global oil prices.",
      "\u201cThey bought Russian oil because we wanted somebody to buy Russian oil,\u201d Eric Garcetti, the U.S. ambassador to India under President Joe Biden, said at a conference last year. \u201cIt was actually the design of the policy, because as a commodity we didn\u2019t want oil prices going up.\u201d",
      "The U.S. position on India\u2019s oil purchases appears to have reversed under Trump, who said in a social media post last week that India and Russia \u201ccan take their dead economies down together.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are now at a stage where the American ability to control Russia and its allies is beginning to impact India,\u201d Palit said.",
      "Jaishankar said that while Trump\u2019s actions won\u2019t push India out of America\u2019s orbit, they could drive India to strengthen ties with other countries such as China. During a meeting of their foreign ministers in Beijing last month, India and China agreed to resume direct flights between their countries for the first time in five years.",
      "Despite the recent setbacks in their relationship, India will continue to engage with the U.S. as a key strategic and technological partner, said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cBut I think it\u2019s a wake-up call of sorts,\u201d he said."

      "A lion that was being tracked by Oxford University researchers in western Zimbabwe has been killed by a trophy hunter, in what one wildlife campaigner called a \u2018harrowing echo\u2019 of Cecil the Lion\u2019s death in 2015.",
      "Blondie, a tourist favorite, was hunted down after being lured and baited out of Gwayi Conservancy, near Hwange National Park, according to the Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting (CBTH), an advocacy organization based in the U.K.",
      "While lion hunting is not illegal in Zimbabwe, Blondie\u2019s killing was because he was under the country\u2019s minimum age of 6, according to Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves, the organization\u2019s founder.",
      "\u201cBlondie was a father, a leader, a national treasure, not a plaything for a rich Westerner with a gun,\u201d Gon\u00e7alves said. \u201cGovernments must act now.\u201d",
      "The beloved feline was killed in late June but his death only began to garner international attention in the last week.",

      "Africa Geographic\u2019s CEO, Simon Epsley, said the organization was \u201cdismayed and angered\u201d at the killing.",
      "\u201cThat Blondie\u2019s prominent collar did not prevent him from being offered to a hunting client confirms the stark reality that no lion is safe from trophy hunting guns,\u201d he said.",
      "Collars are used to track the animals, limit wildlife-human conflict and support conservation.",
      "Zimbabwean law allows a maximum of 100 lions above the age of 6 to be hunted each year in the country, where safaris and big game hunting are important sources of income.",
      "A spokesperson for the Zimbabwe Parks Agency, the government hunting regulator, denied that Blondie\u2019s killing had broken the law because he was older than 6.",
      "\u201cThis allegation that these people are saying the lion was less than 6 years? We don\u2019t know that. Was there any DNA which was taken to prove that the lion was less than 6 years? The answer is definitely no,\u201d Tinashe Farawo told NBC News.",
      "This claim was backed up by Michael Blignaut, co-owner of Victoria Falls Safari Service, the company allegedly behind the killing of Blondie.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately at this time I cannot comment,\u201d he told NBC News via the WhatsApp messaging service. \u201cI wanna assure you the hunt was done ethically and it was legal.\u201d",
      "The identity of the hunter, who presumptively paid thousands of dollars to kill the lion, has not been released.",
      "But Farawo denied that anything illegal happened, and said these sorts of hunts paid for conservation efforts.",
      "Born Free, another U.K.-based advocacy group, has expressed concern for Blondie\u2019s pride, saying the fate of its three female partners and a number of cubs was \u201cseriously in doubt.\u201d",
      "In 2015, Minnesota dentist Walter James Palmer sparked outrage when he admittedly killed Cecil the Lion after paying $50,000 for the experience.",
      "At the time, Palmer said he had the correct permits, worked with local guides, and had no reason to question the legitimacy of the hunt until after it was over.",
      "Zimbabwean authorities charged Theo Bronchorst, a professional hunter who allegedly took Palmer on the hunt, but later dropped them. Cecil was also being tracked by researchers at the University of Oxford\u2019s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.",
      "After the worldwide outrage caused by Cecil\u2019s killing, Zimbabwean authorities vowed to crack down on trophy hunting  \u2014 but pressure groups say it hasn\u2019t worked.",

      "\u201cThe very fact that they lure lions out of national parks suggests that there are no lions remaining in the hunting areas for them to hunt, reflecting the massive damage to lion populations that trophy hunting is doing,\u201d Jones said."

Trump has made no public promise of weapons or economic support for Ukraine.",

It also comes days before the expiration of Trump\u2019s deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face additional tariffs.",

      "Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversees the case against Bolsonaro before the top court, said in his decision that the 70-year-old former president had violated precautionary measures imposed on him by posting content on the social media channels of his three lawmaker sons.",
      "The trial of the far-right leader is receiving renewed attention after U.S. President Donald Trump directly tied a 50% tariff on imported Brazilian goods to his ally\u2019s judicial situation. Trump has called the proceedings a \u201c witch hunt,\u201d triggering nationalist reactions from leaders of all branches of power in Brazil, including President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",

      "Following news of the arrest order, a staffer with Brazil\u2019s federal police told The Associated Press that federal agents had seized cell phones at Bolsonaro\u2019s residence in the capital of Brasilia, as ordered by de Moraes in his decision. The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity due to their lack of authorization to speak about the matter publicly.",
      "Bolsonaro is expected to remain in Brasilia for his house arrest as he is not allowed to travel. He also has a house in Rio de Janeiro, where he held his electoral base as a lawmaker for three decades. The former army captain is the fourth former president of Brazil to be arrested since the end of the country\u2019s military rule from 1964 to 1985, which Bolsonaro supported.",
      "\u2018Flagrant disrespect\u2019",
      "The move from the Brazilian justice comes a day after tens of thousands of Bolsonaro supporters took the streets in the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio, pleading for Brazil\u2019s congress to pardon him and hundreds of others who are either under trial or jailed for their roles in the destruction of government buildings in Brasilia on Jan. 8, 2023.",
      "On Sunday, Bolsonaro addressed supporters in Rio through the phone of one of his sons, which de Moraes\u2019 described as illegal.",

      "Lawyers for the former Brazilian president did not make comments after the decision. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro claimed on X that Brazil \u201cis officially in a dictatorship\u201d after his father\u2019s house arrest.",
      "\u201cThe persecution of de Moraes against Bolsonaro has no limits!\u201d the senator wrote.",
      "De Moraes added in his ruling that Jair Bolsonaro, who governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022, has spread messages with \u201ca clear content of encouragement and instigation to attacks against the Supreme Court and a blatant support for foreign intervention in the Brazilian Judiciary\u201d \u2014 likely a veiled reference to Trump\u2019s support for Bolsonaro.",
      "De Moraes also said that Bolsonaro \u201caddressed protesters gathered in Copacabana, in Rio\u201d on Sunday so his supporters could \u201ctry to coerce the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Last week, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions on de Moraes over alleged suppression of freedom of expression and the ongoing trial of Bolsonaro.",
      "Possible trouble ahead",
      "Creomar de Souza, a political analyst of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy, a political consultancy firm based in Brasilia, said Bolsonaro\u2019s house arrest opens a new moment for the country\u2019s opposition, which could gather steam in fighting against Lula\u2019s reelection bid next year.",
      "Now, de Souza said, \u201cthe 2026 election looks like turmoil\u201d and the political debate in Brazil will likely be split between two key struggles.",
      "\u201cOne is the effort of Bolsonaro supporters to keep strong on the right, no matter if it is pushing for amnesty in congress or putting themselves physically out there,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cThe second is how the Lula administration will try to show that the country has a government.\u201d",

      "That causes harm at every stage of its lifecycle: from the extraction of fossil fuels and production to its use by humans and eventual disposal into the environment, the British publication said.",
      "\u201cPlastics are a grave, growing, and under-recognised danger to human and planetary health,\u201d it said. \u201cPlastics cause disease and death from infancy to old age\u201d and are \u201ccontributing to climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.\u201d",

      "Yu was part of the Chinese team that took bronze in the women\u2019s 4x200-meter freestyle relay, with the United States winning silver and Australia winning gold. Though she did not compete in the final, she received a medal because she swam in the qualifying race.",
      "\u201cI was really excited to join the relay. It felt great,\u201d Yu told reporters Thursday. \u201cThe World Championships are fun, and I hope to swim faster.\u201d",
      "The Chinese prodigy began swimming around age 6 just to beat the heat in her home province of Hebei. She said she never thought about becoming a professional athlete until a coach approached her at a swimming pool one day.",
      "\u201cAt the time, I thought: why not give training a try?\u201d Yu told Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency, in May.",
      "Yu, who is also the youngest person to medal at a major international competition since 1936, swims so fast that she qualified for the World Aquatics Championships even though the minimum age requirement is usually 14.",
      "She came close to medaling in three other events in Singapore, missing the podium by 0.06 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter medley Monday, 0.31 seconds in the women\u2019s 200-meter butterfly Thursday and 0.50 seconds in the women\u2019s 400-meter individual medley on Sunday.",
      "At the Chinese national championships in May, Yu finished the 200-meter individual medley with a time of 2:10.63, winning a silver medal and setting a world record in the event for any 12-year-old, male or female.",
      "Hailed as the world\u2019s greatest swimmer her age, Yu has been compared to phenoms such as Canada\u2019s Summer McIntosh, who won four golds in Singapore including the 400-meter medley. Though Yu came in fourth, she is already swimming that event about 15 seconds faster than McIntosh was at the same age.",
      "Her stunning performance before she\u2019s even a teenager has many wondering how she might shape competitive swimming in the years to come.",
      "But some Chinese sports fans and commentators have urged the public not to overhype the preteen rising star.",
      "Yu\u2019s sudden fame may expose her to \u201cdisproportionate\u201d pressure that could keep her from achieving her full potential, the state-backed digital news outlet Shanghai Observer said in an editorial Thursday.",
      "\u201cWe must let this 12-year-old grow her splash slowly into a wave,\u201d it said, adding that there is \u201cno need to rush into hero worship.\u201d",
      "The warning hinted at a shift in how China promotes its elite athletes in the wake of persistent doping allegations and what has been criticized as a \u201ctoxic\u201d fan culture.",
      "Success at the highest levels of sport has been central to China\u2019s construction of national identity, with the government focused on  dominating medal tables at the Olympics and other events.",
      "But the push for gold medals also puts a lot of stress on the countries\u2019 star athletes, as does the intensity of public scrutiny.",
      "Organized sports fandom first emerged around 2016 when Chinese social media users, jaded by sex scandals that had tarnished the wholesome image of pop stars they previously adored, began following Olympic athletes instead, said Zhang Bin, a veteran sports commentator in China.",
      "The new fans brought \u201csophisticated strategies\u201d from the entertainment industry, setting off \u201cfandom wars\u201d among different groups that tried to outdo each other in supporting their athletes, Zhang said.",
      "China\u2019s extreme sports fan culture, which can include fan mobs, cyberbullying of athletes and heckling behavior at sports events, was especially visible around the Paris Olympics last year.",
      "When gold-medal-winning diver Quan Hongchan returned to her hometown, visitors flocked to her home for days. Some livestreamed with their phones while others flew drones, and travel agencies even started offering tours of her village.",
      "Pan Zhanle, an Olympic champion swimmer, was praised for disbanding his official fan group after his success at the Paris Games overwhelmed him with a surge of new followers.",
      "The Chinese government has been cracking down, with its cyberspace watchdog saying in April that it had shut down over 3,700 social media accounts with illegal or noncompliant content aimed at Chinese athletes.",
      "But sometimes the frenzy goes beyond the internet. Chinese table tennis player Fan Zhendong, an Olympic gold medalist, said he was traumatized when a stranger sneaked into his hotel room in 2023.",
      "\u201cI never thought, as an athlete, I would have to go through something like this,\u201d he told Phoenix TV last week, adding that organized online abuse had caused him \u201csevere\u201d mental stress that contributed to several unexpected losses.",
      "Since sports prodigies naturally attract followers, fan groups could also be a concern for Yu in the future, said Zhang, who was at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore.",
      "China is often overprotective of its athletes, but it \u201cmay not be a good thing if Yu is living in isolation like protected giant pandas,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cFor athletes, learning to interact with the media is a necessary part of their development,\u201d Zhang added.",
      "Jessie Zhou, 23, a graduate student in Hong Kong who closely follows table tennis star Fan, said it was a \u201cgood call\u201d for Chinese media to cover Yu in a \u201crestrained tone\u201d while extreme sports fandom remains unresolved.",
      "\u201cJust let the kid stay focused on training,\u201d Zhou said."

      "A woman has been charged with child neglect in New Zealand after a 2-year-old girl was found inside a suitcase in a bus' luggage compartment Sunday, police said.",
      "The bus driver made the discovery during a scheduled stop in Kaiwaka, a Northland Region town, New Zealand Police Detective Inspector Simon Harrison said in a statement.",
      "The suspect asked to access the compartment during the stop, said Harrison, acting crime manager for the Auckland-adjacent district of Waitemat\u0101.",
      "\"The driver became concerned when he noticed the bag moving,\" he said. \"When the driver opened the suitcase, they discovered the two-year-old girl.\"",
      "The toddler was taken to a hospital for an \"extensive medical assessment\" and was \"reported to be very hot, but otherwise appeared physically unharmed,\" Harrison said.",
      "The suspect, a 27-year-old woman whose name was not released, was arrested and charged with \"ill-treatment/neglect\" of a child, he said. Further charges are not being ruled out, he added.",
      "She is due in court Monday, Harrison said.",
      "It is not clear why the toddler was in a suitcase. Entrada Travel Group, which operates New Zealand's national bus line, InterCity, acknowledged that the incident involved one of its buses.",
      "The bus line says online that children up to 2 years old travel free if they do so on a guardian's lap. Children 3 and older may travel with guardians, but that requires a child ticket, usually sold at a deeply discounted rate.",
      "\"We are aware of an incident involving a passenger on one of our services,\" Entrada Travel Group said by email. \"Police were called to respond and are investigating the matter. No one was harmed during the incident, and the service resumed.\"",
      "It said it could not comment further amid the ongoing investigation.",
      "Harrison praised the bus driver for being aware and taking action.",
      "\"We would like to acknowledge and commend the bus driver, who noticed something wasn\u2019t right and took immediate action, preventing what could have been a far worse outcome,\" he said.",
      "Kaiwaka is about 60 miles north of Auckland along the country's central artery, State Highway 1."
