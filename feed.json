      "Hundreds of people in Lebanon have paid tribute to iconic composer, pianist and playwright Ziad Rahbani, who died over the weekend",
      "BEIRUT -- Hundreds of people in Lebanon paid tribute Monday to iconic composer, pianist and playwright Ziad Rahbani, who died over the weekend. His mother, Fayrouz, one of the Arab world's most esteemed singers, made a rare public appearance.",
      "Rahbani, also known as a political provocateur, died Saturday at age 69. The cause of death was not immediately known.",
      "His passing shocked much of the Arab world, which appreciated his satire, unapologetic political critique and avante-garde, jazz-inspired compositions that mirrored the chaos and contradictions of Lebanon throughout its civil war from 1975 until 1990. He also composed some of his mother's most famous songs.",
      "The Rahbani family was a cornerstone in Lebanon's golden era of music theater that today is steeped in idealism and nostalgia in a troubled country.",
      "Top Lebanese political officials and artists paid tribute after the death was announced. Rahbani, a leftist Greek Orthodox, often mocked Lebanon\u2019s sectarian divisions in his work.",
      "Hundreds of people holding roses and photos gathered by Khoury Hospital near Beirut's busy Hamra district, solemnly singing some of his most famous songs and applauding as a vehicle carrying his body left its garage.",
      "Reem Haidar, who grew up during the civil war, said Rahbani\u2019s songs and their messages were what she and others associated with at a time when there was \u201cno nation to belong to.\u201d",

      "Fayrouz, 90, had spent many years away from the public eye. Wearing black sunglasses and a black veil, she greeted visitors who came to pay respects. She had not been seen publicly since photos surfaced of her meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, who visited her residence in 2020 to award her France's highest medal of honor.",
      "In recent years, Rahbani also appeared less in the public eye, yet his influence never waned. Younger generations rediscovered his plays online and sampled his music in protest movements. He continued to compose and write, speaking often of his frustration with Lebanon\u2019s political stagnation and decaying public life.",
      "Rahbani is survived by his mother and his sister Reema and brother Hali.",

      "He won a following in the 1950s and \u201960s lampooning marriage, politics, racism.",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Tom Lehrer, the popular song satirist who lampooned marriage, politics, racism and the Cold War, then largely abandoned his music career to return to teaching math at Harvard and other universities, has died. He was 97.",
      "Longtime friend David Herder said Lehrer died Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He did not specify a cause of death.",
      "Lehrer had remained on the math faculty of the University of California at Santa Cruz well into his late 70s. In 2020, he even turned away from his own copyright, granting the public permission to use his lyrics in any format without any fee in return.",
      "A Harvard prodigy (he had earned a math degree from the institution at age 18), Lehrer soon turned his very sharp mind to old traditions and current events. His songs included \"Poisoning Pigeons in the Park,\" \"The Old Dope Peddler\" (set to a tune reminiscent of \"The Old Lamplighter\"), \"Be Prepared\" (in which he mocked the Boy Scouts) and \"The Vatican Rag,\" in which Lehrer, an atheist, poked at the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church. (Sample lyrics: \u201cGet down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries. Bow your head with great respect, and genuflect, genuflect, genuflect.\u201d)",
      "Accompanying himself on piano, he performed the songs in a colorful style reminiscent of such musical heroes as Gilbert and Sullivan and Stephen Sondheim, the latter a lifelong friend. Lehrer was often likened to such contemporaries as Allen Sherman and Stan Freberg for his comic riffs on culture and politics and he was cited by Randy Newman and \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic among others as an influence.",
      "He mocked the forms of music he didn't like (modern folk songs, rock 'n' roll and modern jazz), laughed at the threat of nuclear annihilation and denounced discrimination.",
      "But he attacked in such an erudite, even polite, manner that almost no one objected.",
      "\"Tom Lehrer is the most brilliant song satirist ever recorded,\" musicologist Barry Hansen once said. Hansen co-produced the 2000 boxed set of Lehrer's songs, \"The Remains of Tom Lehrer,\" and had featured Lehrer's music for decades on his syndicated \"Dr. Demento\" radio show.",
      "Lehrer's body of work was actually quite small, amounting to about three dozen songs.",
      "\"When I got a funny idea for a song, I wrote it. And if I didn't, I didn't,\" Lehrer told The Associated Press in 2000 during a rare interview. \"I wasn't like a real writer who would sit down and put a piece of paper in the typewriter. And when I quit writing, I just quit. ... It wasn't like I had writer's block.\"",
      "He'd gotten into performing accidentally when he began to compose songs in the early 1950s to amuse his friends. Soon he was performing them at coffeehouses around Cambridge, while he remained at Harvard to teach and obtain a master's degree in math.",
      "He cut his first record in 1953, \"Songs by Tom Lehrer,\" which included \"I Wanna Go Back to Dixie,\" lampooning the attitudes of the Old South, and the \"Fight Fiercely, Harvard,\" suggesting how a prissy Harvard blueblood might sing a football fight song.",
      "After a two-year stint in the Army, Lehrer began to perform concerts of his material in venues around the world. In 1959, he released another LP called \"More of Tom Lehrer\" and a live recording called \"An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer,\" nominated for a Grammy for best comedy performance (musical) in 1960.",
      "But around the same time, he largely quit touring and returned to teaching math, though he did some writing and performing on the side.",
      "Lehrer said he was never comfortable appearing in public.",
      "\"I enjoyed it up to a point,\" he told The AP in 2000. \"But to me, going out and performing the concert every night when it was all available on record would be like a novelist going out and reading his novel every night.\"",

(He didn't need to tell his listeners that it was a bastion of segregation at the time.) \"Pollution\" takes a look at the then-new concept that perhaps rivers and lakes should be cleaned up.",

      "His songs were revived in the 1980 musical revue \"Tomfoolery\" and he made a rare public appearance in London in 1998 at a celebration honoring that musical's producer, Cameron Mackintosh.",

      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d is topping the domestic box office charts in its first weekend in theaters",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Marvel\u2019s first family has finally found box office gold. \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps,\u201d the first film about the superheroes made under the guidance of Kevin Feige and the Walt Disney Co., earned $118 million in its first weekend in 4,125 North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "That makes it the fourth biggest opening of the year, behind \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d and \u201cSuperman,\u201d and the biggest Marvel opening since \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d grossed $211 million out of the gate last summer. Internationally, \u201cFantastic Four\u201d made $100 million from 52 territories, adding up to a $218 million worldwide debut. The numbers were within the range the studio was expecting.",
      "The film arrived in the wake of another big superhero reboot, James Gunn's \u201cSuperman,\u201d which opened three weekends ago and has already crossed $500 million globally. That film, from the other main player in comic book films, DC Studios, took second place with $24.9 million domestically.",
      "The box office success of \u201cFirst Steps\u201d and \u201cSuperman\u201d means \u201cthe whole notion of superhero fatigue, which has been talked about a lot, can I think be put to rest. I always say it\u2019s bad movie fatigue, not superhero fatigue,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore.",
      "\u201cFirst Steps\u201d is the latest attempt at bringing the superhuman family to the big screen, following lackluster performances for other versions. The film, based on the original Marvel comics, is set during the 1960s in a retro-futuristic world led by the Fantastic Four, a family of astronauts-turned-superhuman from exposure to cosmic rays during a space mission.",
      "The family is made up of Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), who can stretch his body to incredible lengths; Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), who can render herself invisible; Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn), who transforms into a fiery human torch; and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), who possesses tremendous superhuman strength with his stone-like flesh.",
      "The movie takes place four years after the family gained powers, during which Reed\u2019s inventions have transformed technology, and Sue\u2019s diplomacy has led to global peace.",
      "Both audiences and critics responded positively to the film, which currently has an 88% on Rotten Tomatoes and promising exit poll responses from opening weekend ticket buyers. An estimated 46% of audiences chose to see it on premium screens, including IMAX and other large formats.",
      "The once towering Marvel is working to rebuild audience enthusiasm for its films and characters. Its two previous offerings this year did not reach the cosmic box office heights of \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\" which made over $1.3 billion, or those of the \u201cAvengers\u201d-era. But critically, the films have been on an upswing since the poorly reviewed \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u201d which ultimately grossed $415 million worldwide. \u201cThunderbolts,\" which jumpstarted the summer movie season, was better received critically but financially is capping out at just over $382 million globally.",
      "Like Deadpool and Wolverine, the Fantastic Four characters had been under the banner of 20th Century Fox for years. The studio produced two critically loathed, but decently profitable attempts in the mid-2000s with future Captain America Chris Evans as the Human Torch. In 2015, it tried again (unsuccessfully) with Michael B. Jordan and Miles Teller. They got another chance after Disney's $71 billion acquisition of Fox\u2019s entertainment assets in 2019.",
      "The \u201cFantastic Four's\u201d opening weekend results were a little less than some rival studio projections, Dergarabedian said. Nonetheless, the film is expected to carry movie theater earnings well into August.",
      "Holdovers dominated the top 10, but one other newcomer managed to make the chart. The dark romantic comedy \u201cOh, Hi!\u201d earned $1.1 million from 866 screens.",
      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d landed in third place in its fourth weekend with $13 million, followed by \u201cF1\u201d with $6.2 million. The Brad Pitt racing movie also passed $500 million globally. \u201cSmurfs\u201d rounded out the top five with $5.4 million in its second weekend.",

      "The Belfast trio, scheduled to play on Sziget's closing day on Aug. 11, is known for anarchic energy, satirical lyrics and use of symbolism associated with the Irish republican movement, which seeks to unite Northern Ireland, currently part of the U.K., with the Republic of Ireland.",
      "The group has faced criticism for lyrics laden with expletives and drug references and for political statements seeming to glorify militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.",
      "Kneecap has accused critics of trying to silence the band because of its support for the Palestinian cause throughout Israel's war in Gaza and say they don\u2019t support Hezbollah and Hamas nor condone violence.",
      "Hungary's immigration authority, the National Directorate-General for Aliens Policing, published decrees on Thursday declaring Kneecap members Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in, J.J. \u00d3 Dochartaigh and Liam \u00d3g \u00d3hAnnaidh would be banned from Hungary's territory for three years since their \u201centry and stay constitute a serious threat to national security.\u201d",

      "Hundreds of figures from Hungary's music and cultural community also have signed a petition calling for Kneecap's performance to be cancelled.",

      "\u201cGeorge bore this devastating and debilitating illness with exceptional strength and dignity,\u201d the statement from Golden Earring reads in part. \u201cWe bid farewell to a great musician and composer, whose work extended beyond Golden Earring. George was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, but above all, a friend.\u201d",
      "A native of The Hague, Kooymans was in his mid-teens when he helped found what became Golden Earring in the early 1960s: The band's name was inspired by an instrumental of the time, \u201cGolden Earrings.\u201d He was also a core member of the group's best known lineup, which featured drummer Cesar Zuiderwijk, singer-guitarist Barry Hay and bassist-keyboardist Rinus Gerritsen and stayed together from 1970 until Koosyman's departure.",
      "With more than 20 top 10 singles in their native country, Golden Earring had more success at home than overseas.

      "Hulk Hogan\u2019s back had weakened, a failed early attempt at slamming all 525 pounds of Andre the Giant left the \u201cImmortal One\" unsteady as the World Wrestling Federation champion once more needed to rally to beat another of wrestling\u2019s baddest bad guys.",
      "Andre wrapped his tree-trunk arms around the champ and tried to wring the final breaths out of Hogan with a bear hug so tight that more than 90,000 fans in Detroit almost witnessed the final day of Hulkamania.",
      "But, wait!",
      "This was Hulk Hogan.",
      "Wrestling\u2019s biggest star had more late comebacks than fellow 1980s sports stars John Elway or Michael Jordan combined. Hogan had some gas left in the tank, some extra bite in those 24-inch pythons, and hammered away at Andre. One right hand, then another one, and another! Wrestling fans roared as they knew the bad news that was coming for Andre. Hogan fought back \u2014 much as he did against those 1980s baddies out of the Cold War or Iran \u2014 and finally body-slammed Andre the Giant. Hogan hit the hopes and delivered his famous leg drop on Andre\u2019s chest to get the three count.",
      "Hulk Hogan won again at WrestleMania.",
      "He always won, of course. It\u2019s what the story called for and there was no reason for WWF owner and pro wrestler puppeteer Vince McMahon to ever deviate from the plan of Hulkamania running wild.",
      "Why would he?",
      "Hogan had the hulking size, the charisma and catchphrases \u2014 \u201cWhat\u2019cha gonna do when Hulkamania runs wild on you?\u201d \u2014 that led the industry out of gyms and regional arenas and into NFL stadiums, like that 1987 night when Hogan beat Andre at the Pontiac Silverdome in WrestleMania III.",
      "\u201cThere he is,\u201d announcer Gorilla Monsoon said, as Hogan played to the crowd, \u201cthe greatest professional athlete in the world today.\u201d",
      "Whether you break out an eye roll or crank up Hogan\u2019s \u201c Real American \u201d anthem to that statement depends, of course, on one\u2019s ability to suspend disbelief. There is no denying, though, just how real Hogan\u2019s impact was on professional wrestling and pop culture in the 1980s. He stood toe-to-toe with Rocky Balboa. He fought side-by-side with Mr. T. He hosted \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and flexed on the cover of Sports Illustrated.",
      "\u201cHe did what he set out to do,\u201d WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter said Friday by phone. \u201cHe became the most recognized, not only professional wrestler and sports entertainer in the world, he\u2019s probably top-five of anybody you\u2019d recognize when you saw him.\u201d",
      "WWE has long claimed the paid attendance of WrestleMania III was 93,173, a number some historians claim is as artificially inflated as the chemically-enhanced biceps of that era. What can\u2019t be disputed, when the two had their match in 1988, live on national television, more than 33 million fans tuned in to NBC, still far and away the record for largest viewing audience in American televised wrestling.",
      "Making money and moving merch. That was the real power of Hulkamania.",
      "Hogan, who died Thursday in Florida at age 71, left behind more than three decades of memorable matches that captured the spirit of those little Hulkamaniacs to the ones that loved to hate him in the 1990s as \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan in the New World Order.",
      "Here are some of his best moments.",
      "Hogan wasn\u2019t some upstart when he returned to the WWF (now WWE) in late 1983. He tested the waters of Hulkamania in the old American Wrestling Association and made his famous appearance as Thunderlips in \u201cRocky III,\u201d when was beckoned back to WWE and became an instant contender to face the champion, the hated Iron Sheik. Hogan broke out of the dreaded camel clutch and pinned the Sheik to become the new champion on Jan. 23, 1984, at Madison Square Garden \u2014 the building paid tribute to Hogan on Thursday night \u2014 and set the course for Hulkamania.",

If the company said Andre the Giant had never been slammed, and had never been pinned over a 15-year undefeated streak, then it was believed to be true (neither were, of course).",
      "Yet, the faux hype set the stage for the match that changed wrestling forever.",
      "\u201cAndre the Giant was a momentum-shifting moment where he passed his torch,\u201d Hogan said in a 2009 interview with the AP. \u201cHe was like the icing on the cake. Once he blessed me, it was up to me to mold that business and carry it through.\u201d",
      "By 1996, Hogan\u2019s good-guy, beats-the-odds character had grown stale as he made the shift from WWE to Ted Turner\u2019s World Championship Wrestling. Hogan even started to get booed as wrestling fans clamored for a new direction, a new star on top.",
      "They got one. \u201cHollywood\u201d Hulk Hogan.",
      "For weeks, two former WWE stars had \u201cinvaded\u201d WCW and claimed they were taking over the company. That led to a six-man tag-team match where the two outsiders, Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, promised a third man to help with their cause. No one showed to help the two until the end, when Hogan walked out in his red-and-yellow attire, and stunned the crowd when he put the leg drop on Randy Savage. Hogan was third man. He ditched his traditional colors for black-and-white, sunglasses, dark facial hair and embraced the \u201cHollywood\u201d heel persona.",
      "Much as he did a decade earlier, Hogan led WCW to new heights and the company would defeat WWE in the TV ratings for 83 straight weeks in what would be known as the \u201cMonday Night Wars.\u201d Hogan lost as much as he won without his Hulkamania powers. He still moved the needle where it mattered most and made WCW must-see TV every Monday night.",
      "With WCW out of business and bought by McMahon, Hogan kept a low profile until he made a comeback with WWE in 2002. He returned with Hall and Nash as the NWO but at this point, WWE fans wanted their old Hulkster back.",
      "Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson was WWE\u2019s baby-faced crowd favorite when he met the villainous Hogan at WrestleMania in an \u201cIcon vs. Icon\u201d match in WrestleMania in 2002. One problem, the Toronto crowd decided to back Hogan.",
      "\u201cWhen we hit the ring, 70,000 loyal people didn\u2019t want to hate Hulk Hogan,\u201d Hogan said in 2009. \u201cEverybody kind of started to panic and I just said, \u2019Brother, stick with me and I\u2019ll get you through this.\u201d\u2019",
      "After the match, the cheers for Hogan called for a last-second change of plans, with his former NWO allies running down to attack him. The Rock helped Hogan fight off the NWO and the two men posed together to riotous cheers.",
      "\u201cAs I raised his hand and said he\u2019s the greatest wrestler in the world, they had to turn me back red and yellow immediately,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of interesting, that was going to be the nail in my coffin. It turned out to be the fountain of youth for me.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- MrBeast's new CEO hit Wall Street Wednesday as YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson's media empire looks to develop long-term brand partnerships and, in turn, unlock more funding for its charitable content.",
      "Venture capitalist Jeff Housenbold took over MrBeast leadership last summer with a mandate to professionalize an ever-growing entertainment company. YouTube's most popular creator had reached record audience levels far outpacing its startup days, while vowing to reassess its internal culture amid multiple controversies. But, despite joining Nasdaq's closing bell ceremony on Wednesday, Housenbold said their strategic plan does not currently include a public offering \u2014 or any active funding rounds.",
      "\u201cDo I want to make banger content? Yeah. That\u2019s cool,\" Housenbold told The Associated Press. \"But what can we do with that banger content? Generate profits, make a sustainable business that gives us greater ability to impact people\u2019s lives around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re marching quickly to profitability, so we don\u2019t have to raise additional capital,\u201d he added.",
      "Instead, MrBeast is focused on securing multi-year exclusive advertising deals as opposed to single-video brand partnerships. With 416 million subscribers and legions of impressionable young fans, Housenbold argued that MrBeast is uniquely positioned to deliver more bang for companies' marketing bucks by pointing that \u201cfirehouse of attention\u201d at them.",
      "Along the way, Housenbold said he is encouraging Donaldson to tout the channel's charitable works \u2014 which often feature quantifiable stunts such as building wells, removing ocean plastic or covering cataract surgery costs. The company, in his view, \u201ccan do good while doing well.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more people who like us \u2019cause we do good, the more people watch our videos,\" he said. \u201cThe more people watch our videos, the more we\u2019re able to drive in fees from our advertising partners... the more we can invest in more content to do more good in the world.\u201d",
      "New projects such as the Amazon Prime reality show and a James Patterson novel from HarperCollins aim to diversify the genders and ages of his audience. Housenbold said that base has historically consisted mostly of 8-to-25-year-olds and men.",
      "But Housenbold acknowledged missteps in last year's production of \u201cBeast Games,\" which prompted allegations of \u201cunsafe\u201d conditions from some contestants who said an unorganized set led to injuries, irregular food provision and lacking access to medication. While describing most of those reports as \u201cinaccurate,\u201d Housenbold said they were \u201cbetter prepared\u201d for the second season's recently wrapped shoot.",

      "Since its initial release in 1973, \u201cBuckingham Nicks\u201d has never been reissued and is not currently available on streaming platforms. The remastered version arrives Sept. 19 via Rhino Records' high-fidelity series and was sourced from the original analog master tapes. The album will also receive a CD and digital release for the first time, and the opening track, \u201cCrying in the Night,\u201d was available to stream Wednesday.",
      "Buckingham and Nicks were in their early to mid-20s during the making of their album. \u201cIt was a very natural thing, from the beginning,\u201d Nicks says in the re-release's liner notes, written by music journalist David Fricke.",
      "Despite their relative inexperience, \u201cit stands up in a way you would hope it would, by these two kids who were pretty young to be doing that work,\u201d Buckingham says, according to the announcement release.",
      "The reissue announcement was foreshadowed by cryptic Instagram posts last week. Both Nicks and Buckingham shared handwritten lyrics to their official social media accounts.",
      "\u201cAnd if you go forward\u2026\u201d Nicks posted, a line from their song \u201cFrozen Love,\u201d which appears on \u201cBuckingham Nicks.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll meet you there,\u201d Buckingham shared, completing the lyric.",

He claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds. Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",

      "Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain\u2019s greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died",
      "LONDON -- Cleo Laine, whose husky contralto was one of the most distinctive voices in jazz and who was regarded by many as Britain's greatest contribution to the quintessentially American music, has died. She was 97.",
      "The Stables, a charity and venue Laine founded with her late jazz musician husband John Dankworth, said Friday it was \u201cgreatly saddened\u201d by the news that \u201cone of its founders and Life President, Dame Cleo Laine has passed away.\"",
      "Monica Ferguson, artistic director of The Stables, said Laine \"will be greatly missed, but her unique talent will always be remembered.\u201d",
      "Laine's career spanned the Atlantic and crossed genres: She sang the songs of Kurt Weill, Arnold Schoenberg and Robert Schumann; she acted on stage and on film, and even played God in a production of Benjamin Britten's \"Noye's Fludde.\"",
      "Laine's life and art were intimately bound up with band leader Dankworth, who gave her a job and her stage name in 1951, and married her seven years later. Both were still performing after their 80th birthdays. Dankworth died in 2010 at 82.",
      "In 1997, Laine became the first British jazz artist to be made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight.",
      "\"It is British jazz that should have received the accolade for its service to me,\" she said when the honor was announced. \"It has given me a wonderful life, a successful career and an opportunity to travel the globe doing what I love to do.\"",
      "Laine was born Clementina Dinah Campbell in 1927. Her father, Alexander Campbell, was a Jamaican who loved opera and earned money during the Depression as a street singer. Despite hard times, her British mother, Minnie, made sure that her daughter had piano, voice and dance lessons.",
      "She began performing at local events at age 3, and at age 12 she got a role as a movie extra in \"The Thief of Bagdad.\" Leaving school at 14, Laine went to work as a hairdresser and faced repeated rejection in her efforts to get a job as a singer.",
      "A decade later, in 1951, she tried out for the Johnny Dankworth Seven, and succeeded. \"Clementina Campbell\" was judged too long for a marquee, so she became Cleo Laine.",
      "\"John said that when he heard me, I didn't sound like anyone else who was singing at the time,\" Laine once said. \"I guess the reason I didn't get the other jobs is that they were looking for a singer who did sound like somebody else.\"",
      "Laine had a remarkable range, from tenor to contralto, and a sound often described as \"smoky.\"",
      "Dankworth, in an interview with the Irish Independent, recalled Laine's audition.",
      "\"They were all sitting there with stony faces, so I asked the Scottish trumpet player Jimmy Deuchar, who was looking very glum and was the hardest nut of all, whether he thought she had something. 'Something?' he said, 'She's got everything!'\"",
      "Offered 6 pounds a week, Laine demanded \u2014 and got \u2014 7 pounds.",
      "\"They used to call me 'Scruff', although I don't think I was scruffy. It was just that having come from the sticks, I didn't know how to put things together as well as the other singers of the day,\" she told the Irish Independent. \"And anyway, I didn't have the money, because they weren't paying me enough.\"",
      "Recognition came swiftly. Laine was runner-up in Melody Maker's \"girl singer\" category in 1952, and topped the list in 1956 and 1957.",
      "She married Dankworth \u2014 and quit his band \u2014 in 1958, a year after her divorce from her first husband, George Langridge. As Dankworth's band prospered, Laine began to feel underused.",

      "Her stage career began in 1958 when she was invited to join the cast of a West Indian play, \"Flesh to a Tiger,\" at the Royal Court Theatre, and was surprised to find herself in the lead role. She won a Moscow Arts Theatre Award for her performance.",

      "A United Nations report highlights rising food insecurity in Africa, with over 1 billion people unable to afford a healthy diet in 2024",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Food insecurity is rising in many parts of Africa, with the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet surpassing 1 billion \u2014 some two-thirds of the continent's population \u2014 in 2024, according to a United Nations report published Monday.",
      "The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in Africa is more than double the global average of 28%, whereas figures from Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and Oceania don\u2019t reach that mark, the report said.",
      "The annual report, produced by five U.N. agencies, analyzes trends in efforts to achieve the goal of zero hunger around the world by 2030. Those agencies include the World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Program.",
      "An estimated 8.2% of the global population may have faced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023 and 8.7% in 2022, a positive trend that \u201ccontrasts with the steady rise in hunger in most subregions of Africa\u201d and in western Asia, or parts of the Middle East and South Asia, the report said.",
      "The prevalence of undernourishment, a key measure of progress, surpassed 20% in Africa and rose to 12.7% in western Asia, it said.",
      "The report is the latest to suggest that eliminating food insecurity universally remains a serious challenge. Africa remains the most vulnerable continent.",
      "According to the current projection, 512 million people in the world may be chronically undernourished in 2030, with nearly 60% of them to be found in Africa, the report said.",
      "\u201cWe must urgently reverse this trajectory,\u201d said M\u00e1ximo Torero, chief economist with the FAO.",
      "A major mark of distress is the number of Africans unable to afford a healthy diet. While the global figure fell from 2.76 billion in 2019 to 2.6 billion in 2024, the number increased in Africa from 864 million to just over 1 billion during the same period.",
      "That means the vast majority of Africans are unable to eat well on the continent of 1.5 billion people.",
      "The U.N. warned in a report in October that conflicts, economic instability and climate shocks \u2014 in addition to reduced funding for emergency food and agriculture assistance \u2014 were driving alarming levels of acute food insecurity in 22 \u201chunger hot spots.\u201d",

      "A former Ukrainian prisoner of war has embraced life with urgency since his release in April",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Since his release from a Russian prison in April, Stanislav Tarnavskyi has been in a hurry to build the life in Ukraine he dreamed about during three years of captivity.",
      "The 25-year-old has proposed to his girlfriend, bought an apartment and adopted a golden retriever. And that was just what he accomplished one week in July.",
      "But as busy as he is rekindling old relationships and creating new ones, Tarnavskyi cannot shake the trauma he and thousands of other Ukrainian soldiers experienced as prisoners of war. The U.N. says many endured beatings, starvation and humiliation at the hands of their captors \u2014 experiences that will leave lifelong scars.",
      "Tarnavskyi, who was captured during the battle for Mariupol in April of 2022, regularly has nightmares about the prisons where he was held.",
      "\u201cI see the officers who watched over us. I dream they want to harm me, catch me,\u201d he said. When he wakes up, his heart pounds, anxiety surges \u2014 until he realizes he is in the outskirts of Kyiv, where he was forced to move because Russia occupied his hometown of Berdiansk.",
      "As the three-year war drags on, Tarnavskyi is one of more than 5,000 former POWs back in Ukraine rehabilitating with the help of regular counseling. Regardless of any physical injuries that may require attention, psychologists say it is vital to monitor former POWs for years after their release; the cost of war, they say, echoes for generations.",
      "In a photography studio high above Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, sunlight floods the white walls. After a shoot that lasted several hours Tarnavskyi said the brightness was hurting his eyes, which are still sensitive from years spent in a dark cell.",
      "But his mood couldn't be dimmed. The girlfriend who waited for his return had just consented to his surprise proposal.",
      "\u201cI love you very much, I am very glad that you waited for me,\" Tarnavskyi said, holding a thick bouquet of pink roses and a ring. \"You have always been my support, and I hope you will remain so for the rest of my life. Will you marry me?\u201d",
      "Tarnavskyi said it was the thought of Tetiana Baieva \u2014 whom he met in 2021 \u2014 that helped stop him from taking his own life three times during captivity.",
      "Still, he finds it hard to talk with Baieva about his time in prison. He doesn't want to be pitied.",
      "Soon after he returned home, he was paranoid, feeling watched \u2014 a reaction to constant surveillance in prison. \u201cIf you stepped out of line, they\u2019d (Russians) come and beat you. I still get flashbacks when I see (surveillance) cameras. If I see one, I get nervous,\u201d he said.",
      "But with each passing week, he is feeling better, progress Tarnavskyi credits to the work he is doing with a psychologist.",
      "Any small stimulus \u2014 a smell, a breeze, a color \u2014 can trigger traumatic memories for POWs, says Kseniia Voznitsyna, the director of Ukraine's Lisova Polyana mental health center for veterans on the outskirts of Kyiv.",
      "Yet contrary to stereotypes, ex-POWs aren\u2019t more aggressive. \u201cThey tend to isolate themselves, avoid large gatherings, and struggle with trust,\u201d said Voznitsyna.",
      "\u201cThey say time heals \u2014 five or 10 years, maybe \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t,\" she added. \"It just feels less intense.\u201d",

      "\u201cI love music. Music unites,\u201d he said, touching the tattoo of a treble clef behind his ear \u2014 inked after his return. Even in captivity, he sang quietly to himself, composing songs in his mind about love, home and war. Now he dreams of turning that passion into a career as an artist.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve become stronger now,\u201d Zalizko said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of death, not afraid of losing an arm or a leg, not afraid of dying instantly. I fear nothing anymore.\u201d",

      "Michigan has become a leader in safe drinking water after the Flint crisis, but mobile home parks remain a rough spot",
      "After the Flint water crisis, Michigan became a national leader on safe drinking water, requiring the removal of lead pipes and the reduction of harmful \u201cforever chemicals\u201d years before the federal government acted.",
      "But the state has a blind spot when it comes to the hundreds of thousands of people who live in its mobile home parks.",
      "Regulators say they have little power to enforce the rules in the state's estimated 100 or more unlicensed parks when owners fail to provide safe water. The problem is compounded by private equity firms that have been buying up parks over the past two decades and now control about 1 in every 6 parks in Michigan \u2014 among the highest rates in the country, according to the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a group that advocates against such purchases.",
      "Officials say it can be a struggle to even contact those park owners, let alone get them to comply with regulations.",
      "\u201cWith private equity moving into this space, the goal these companies seem to have is to return the absolute highest return they can to investors even if that means providing inadequate service or engaging in exploitative practices, or unsafe practices for the residents,\u201d said state Sen. John Cherry, a Democrat who sponsored legislation to strengthen enforcement in the communities.",
      "But the state doesn't attempt to track unlicensed parks. And an industry spokesperson said Michigan officials \u2014 particularly law enforcement \u2014 have the power to do more if they choose.",
      "At North Morris Estates where Theo Gantos lives outside Flint, conditions got so bad that the state refused to renew the park\u2019s license to operate.",
      "Water often flowed weakly from the tap because the wells that service the park didn\u2019t produce enough, Gantos said. Sometimes the water was discolored. It could stain laundry and destroy appliances. He installed a multistage filter system just to be able to use it.",
      "Eventually, local law enforcement investigated. In March, the owner pleaded guilty to a criminal charge for operating without a license, agreeing to pay a fine and sell the park.",
      "That might not have happened if Gantos had not been so pugnacious. He spent years battling Homes of America, an affiliate of private equity group Alden Global Capital that local prosecutors said owns North Morris. That included filing a public records request for emails on officials\u2019 handling of problems at his park, pushing regulators to enforce rules and speaking out to media over what he calls blight conditions.",
      "\u201cThese guys, they don\u2019t care,\u201d Gantos said about complying with the rules.",
      "Representatives of North Morris and Homes of America, including an attorney who appeared for the park in legal proceedings, did not respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "The Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs, called LARA, has the authority to inspect and investigate complaints at licensed mobile home parks. But it\u2019s typically fallen to law enforcement to pursue criminal charges against unlicensed parks.",
      "The North Morris conviction for operating without a license is likely the first such under the state\u2019s mobile home law that has been on the books since 1987, the county prosecutor said.",

      "\u201cThis whole notion that, \u2018There\u2019s nothing we can do about this.\u2019 Clearly there is, or that prosecution wouldn\u2019t have taken place,\u201d Lindley said. \u201cNot having the authority to go after communities that don\u2019t have a license is completely different from choosing not to go after those. And what we\u2019ve seen so far with both the state and local units of government is they\u2019ve elected not to.\u201d",
      "Mobile home parks without a license are \u201cessentially operating unregulated,\u201d Cherry said. One of the state\u2019s few options is to shut down a park, a rarely used last resort that can mean throwing people out of their homes.",
      "Mobile home parks have long been an important affordable housing option. But that affordability is fading.",
      "A study by Lending Tree, a lending marketplace, found new mobile home sale prices rose more than 50% nationally from 2018 to 2023 \u2014 new single-family home price averages, by contrast, rose 38% over that period.",
      "Last year, LARA supported legislation that would have given the department more power to penalize unlicensed parks, force parks to provide owner contact information and limit rent increases. That failed.",
      "This year, Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin has proposed a narrower law that would give state drinking water officials more power to make sure water in all mobile home parks is drinkable. Right now, they only have direct authority over parks that provide their own water. But it\u2019s common for parks to take city water from a pipe connecting to the nearby town.",
      "That water is usually safe when it reaches the park, but if the park\u2019s water pipes crack or fail, water protections won\u2019t apply on the private property. That keeps officials from stepping in and forcing change except in limited situations when there\u2019s a public health threat. It can leave residents unsure where to turn when the owner refuses to fix problems.",
      "\u201cWe take those issues very seriously,\u201d said Eric Oswald, director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy\u2019s drinking water and environmental health division. He said they try to work with licensing officials to ensure water is safe, though \u201cthe problem is, I\u2019m not resourced for that.\u201d",
      "The Michigan Manufactured Housing Association opposed last year\u2019s legislation, arguing it would make mobile homes less affordable. The group says it supports extending water protections to within parks, as called for in this year\u2019s legislation. It passed the state Senate in late June and is now in the GOP-controlled House.",

      "The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV",
      "LONDON -- The European Medicines Agency has recommended authorizing a twice-yearly injectable drug aimed at preventing HIV, which scientists say could help end the virus' transmission.",
      "In a statement on Friday, the EU drug regulator said its evaluations of lenacapavir, sold as Yeytuo in Europe by Gilead Sciences, showed the drug is \u201chighly effective\u201d and \u201cconsidered to be of major public health interest.\u201d Once the regulator's guidance is accepted by the European Commission, the authorization is valid in all 27 EU member countries as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein.",
      "Last year, studies suggested that lenacapavir, already used to treat people with HIV, was nearly 100% effective in stopping transmission in both women and men.",
      "Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the U.N. AIDS agency, has said the drug \u201ccould change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic\u201d if it is made available to everyone who needs it.",
      "In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized lenacapavir to prevent HIV. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization recommended countries offer the drug as an additional option to people at risk of the virus.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly. Other medication aimed at preventing HIV include daily pills that people can take and another injectable drug called cabotegravir, which is given every two months. Lenacapavir\u2019s six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more visits to health clinics or stigma from taking daily pills.",
      "Critics have raised concerns, however, that lenacapavir may not be made widely enough available to stop global outbreaks of HIV. Drugmaker Gilead has said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean.",

      "Millions of people living in mobile home parks don't enjoy the same drinking water protections that Americans are accustomed to",
      "The worst water Colt Smith has seen in 14 years with Utah\u2019s Division of Drinking Water was at a mobile home park, where residents had been drinking it for years before state officials discovered the contamination.",
      "The well water carried cancer-causing arsenic as much as 10 times the federal limit. Smith had to put the rural park under a do-not-drink order that lasted nearly 10 years.",
      "\u201cThe Health Department refers it to us like ... \u2018Why aren\u2019t you guys regulating it?\u2019 We had no idea it existed,\u201d he said.",
      "More than 50 years after the Safe Drinking Water Act was passed to ensure that Americans\u2019 water is free from harmful bacteria, lead and other dangerous substances, millions of people living in mobile home parks can\u2019t always count on those basic protections.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found that nearly 70% of mobile home parks running their own water systems violated safe drinking water rules in the past five years, a higher rate than utilities that supply water for cities and towns, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. And the problems are likely even bigger because the EPA database doesn\u2019t catch all parks.",
      "Even where parks get water from an outside source \u2014 such as a city \u2014 the clean water coming in can become contaminated if it passes through problematic infrastructure before reaching residents' taps. Because the EPA doesn\u2019t generally require this water to be tested and regulated, the problems may go unseen.",
      "Utah is one of the few states to step in with their own rules, according to an AP survey of state policies.",
      "\u201cIf you look back at the history of the Safe Drinking Water Act, like in the \u201970s when they were starting, it was, \u2018Well, as long as the source \u2026 is protected, then by the time it gets to the tap, it\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 And that\u2019s just not how it works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "In one Colorado mobile home park, raw sewage backed up into a bathtub. In a Michigan park, the taps often ran dry and the water resembled tea; in Iowa, it looked like coffee \u2014 scaring residents off drinking it and ruining laundry they could hardly afford to replace. In California, boxes of bottled water crowd a family's kitchen over fears of arsenic.",
      "Almost 17 million people in the U.S. live in mobile homes. Some are comfortable Sun Belt retirees. Many others have modest incomes and see mobile homes as a rare opportunity for home ownership.",
      "To understand how water in the parks can be so troubled, it\u2019s useful to remember that residents often own their homes but rent the land they sit on. Despite the name, it's difficult and expensive to move a mobile home. That means they\u2019re \u201chalfway homeowners,\u201d said Esther Sullivan, a professor of sociology at the University of Colorado in Denver who lived in several mobile home parks as she researched a book. Residents often put up with \u201creally egregious\u201d property maintenance by landlords because all their money is tied up in their home, she said.",
      "Pamela Maxey, 51, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, said she had forgotten what it was like to have reliable, clean water until she traveled to her state Capitol last year to advocate for better mobile home park protections and stayed in a hotel. By then, she had spent eight years in a park where sewage backed up into homes and the flow of tap water was sometimes weak or discolored.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into the bathroom to take a shower that I realized, \u2018I don\u2019t have to jump in here and squint my eyes closed the entire time and make sure water doesn\u2019t get in my mouth because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in it,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI went to brush my teeth, and I just turned the faucet on and I brushed my teeth from the water coming from the faucet. I haven\u2019t been able to do that for over a year.\u201d",
      "Victoria Silva, a premed student in Fort Collins, Colorado, estimates the water in Harmony Village Mobile Home Park where Silva lives went out or lost pressure 20 to 30 times over roughly three years there.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much water they need until the water is out for five minutes when they need to flush, when they need to rinse something off their hands, when they need to make some pasta,\u201d Silva said.",
      "The park's owner says a licensed professional ensures water is maintained and tested, and outages are minimized.",
      "The U.S. has some 50,000 water utilities, most serving small towns and rural areas. Many struggle to find expert staff and funding, and they violate clean water rules more often than the handful of large utilities that serve cities. But even among the hard-pressed small utilities, mobile home parks stand out.",
      "The AP analysis found that more than half these parks failed to perform a required test for at least one contaminant, or failed to properly report the results, in the past five years. And they are far more likely to be repeat offenders of safe drinking water rules overall.",
      "But that's only part of the story. The true rates of mobile home park violations aren\u2019t knowable because the EPA doesn\u2019t track them well. The agency\u2019s tap water violation database depends on information from states that often don\u2019t properly categorize mobile home parks.",
      "When Smith first searched Utah\u2019s database in response to an AP request for data from all 50 states, he found only four small water systems identified as belonging to mobile home parks. With some keyword searches, he identified 33 more.",
      "Other parks aren\u2019t in the databases at all and may be completely unregulated.",

      "\u201cIt was literally us driving around and going, \u2018Wait a minute, there\u2019s a bunch of mobile home parks!\u2019\u201d said Amy Miller, who previously served as EPA\u2019s head of enforcement for the Pacific Southwest region.",
      "The water in these other parks had been off their radar. At some, testing found high levels of cancer-causing arsenic in the water that had been provided to residents for years.",
      "It\u2019s impossible to know how many unnoticed parks are out there. Most states aren\u2019t actively looking for them and say they find very few. In Colorado, after the state passed a new law to require water testing at all mobile home parks, officials uncovered 79 parks with their source of water unknown. That\u2019s about a tenth of the total parks in the state.",
      "Many parks are decades old with aging pipes that can cause chronic water problems, even if the water that supplies the park is clean when it enters the system.",
      "Jake Freeman, the engineering director at Central States Water Resources, a Missouri-based private utility company that specializes in taking over small water systems in 11 states, said substandard and poorly installed pipes are more common to see in mobile home parks.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s hard to find the piping in the mobile home parks because if there\u2019s any kind of obstruction, they just go around it,\u201d he said. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like spaghetti laying in the ground.\u201d",
      "After a major winter storm devastated Texas in 2021, Freeman said, the company found pipes at parks it had taken over that \u201cwere barely buried. Some of them weren\u2019t buried.\u201d",
      "When pipes break and leak, the pressure drops and contaminants can enter water lines. In addition, parks sometimes have stagnant water \u2014 where pipes dead-end or water sits unused \u2014 that increases the risk of bacterial growth.",
      "Rebecca Sadosky is public water supply chief in North Carolina, where mobile home communities make up close to 40% of all water systems. She said owners don\u2019t always realize when they buy a park that they could also be running a mini utility.",
      "\u201cI think they don\u2019t know that they\u2019re getting into the water business,\u201d she said.",
      "Utah is a rare state that enforces safe drinking water standards even within mobile home parks that get their water from another provider, according to AP\u2019s survey of states. A small number of other states like New Hampshire have taken some steps to address water safety in these parks, but in most states frustrated residents may have no one to turn to for help beyond the park owner.",
      "In Colorado, when Silva asked officials who enforces safe drinking water rules, \u201cI just couldn\u2019t get clear answers.\u201d",
      "Steve Via, director of federal regulations at the American Water Works Association utility group, argued against regulating mobile home parks that get their water from a municipality, saying that would further stretch an already taxed oversight system. And if those parks are regulated, what\u2019s to stop the rules from extending to the privately owned pipes in big apartment buildings \u2014 the line has to be drawn somewhere, he said.",
      "Via said residents of parks where an owner refuses to fix water problems have options, including going to their local health departments, suing or complaining publicly.",
      "Silva is among the advocates who fought for years to change Colorado\u2019s rules before they succeeded in passing a law in 2023 that requires water testing in every mobile home park. It gives health officials the ability to go beyond federal law to address taste, color and smell that can make people afraid to drink their water, even when it\u2019s not a health risk. The state is now a leader in protecting mobile home park tap water.",
      "Smith, the Utah environmental scientist, said stopping the contaminated water flowing into the mobile home park and connecting it to a safe supply felt like a career highlight.",
      "He said Utah's culture of making do with scarce water contributed to a willingness for stronger testing and regulations than the federal government requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of the communal nature of like, everybody should have access to clean water,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to transcend political ideologies; it seems to transcend religious ideologies.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The fertility rate in the U.S. dropped to an all-time low in 2024 with less than 1.6 kids per woman, new federal data released Thursday shows.",
      "The U.S. was once among only a few developed countries with a rate that ensured each generation had enough children to replace itself \u2014 about 2.1 kids per woman. But it has been sliding in America for close to two decades as more women are waiting longer to have children or never taking that step at all.",
      "The new statistic is on par with fertility rates in western European countries, according to World Bank data.",
      "Alarmed by recent drops, the Trump administration has taken steps to increase falling birth rates, like issuing an executive order meant to expand access to and reduce costs of in vitro fertilization and backing the idea of \u201cbaby bonuses\u201d that might encourage more couples to have kids.",
      "But there's no reason to be alarmed, according to Leslie Root, a University of Colorado Boulder researcher focused on fertility and population policy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing this as part of an ongoing process of fertility delay. We know that the U.S. population is still growing, and we still have a natural increase \u2014 more births than deaths,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the statistic for the total fertility rate with updated birth data for 2024.",
      "In the early 1960s, the U.S. total fertility rate was around 3.5, but plummeted to 1.7 by 1976 after the Baby Boom ended. It gradually rose to 2.1 in 2007 before falling again, aside from a 2014 uptick. The rate in 2023 was 1.621, and inched down in 2024 to 1.599, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",

      "What happened? CDC officials said it was due to recalculations stemming from a change in the U.S. Census population estimates used to compute the birth rate.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un dismissed the U.S.'s intent to resume diplomacy on North Korea\u2019s denuclearization, as she urged Washington to accept her country as a nuclear weapons state and find a new approach to restart talks.",
      "Kim Yo Jong's statement suggested North Korea would only return to talks if the U.S. rewards it for a partial surrender of its nuclear capability. Some experts say U.S. President Donald Trump could still pursue talks with North Korea to make a diplomatic achievement.",
      "Trump has recently bragged of his personal ties with Kim Jong Un and expressed hopes of restarting nuclear diplomacy between them. Their high-stakes diplomacy in 2018-19 that occurred during Trump's first term unraveled after Trump rejected Kim\u2019s calls for extensive sanctions relief in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearization step. Kim has since executed weapons tests to modernize and expand his nuclear arsenal.",
      "In a statement carried by state media, Kim Yo Jong said she doesn\u2019t deny the personal relationship between her brother and Trump \u201cis not bad.\u201d But she said if their personal relations are to serve the purpose of North Korea\u2019s denuclearization, North Korea would view it as \u201cnothing but a mockery.\u201d",
      "She said North Korea's nuclear capability has sharply increased since the first round of the Kim-Trump diplomacy and that any attempt to deny North Korea as a nuclear weapons state would be rejected.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. fails to accept the changed reality and persists in the failed past, the DPRK- U.S. meeting will remain as a \u2018hope\u2019 of the U.S. side,\u201d Kim Yo Jong said, referring to her country by its official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea.",

      "Kim Yo Jong said she was responding to reported comments by a U.S. official that Trump is open to talks on denuclearization. She likely was referring to a Saturday article by Yonhap news agency that cited an unidentified White House official as saying Trump \u201cremains open to engaging with Leader Kim to achieve a fully denuclearized North Korea.\u201d",

      "Other experts have earlier said that North Korea \u2014 now preoccupied with its expanding cooperation with Russia \u2014 sees no urgent need to resume diplomacy with the U.S. and South Korea. On Monday, Kim Yo Jong rebuffed overtures by South Korea\u2019s new liberal government, saying its \u201cblind trust\u201d in the country\u2019s alliance with the U.S. and hostility toward North Korea make it no different from its conservative predecessor.",

      "During his first term in 2019, Trump posted of his Turnberry property, \u201cVery proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Also, furthers U.K. relationship!\u201d Starmer is not a golfer, but toggling between Trump's Scottish courses shows the outsized influence the president puts on properties bearing his name \u2014 and on golf's ability to shape geopolitics.",
      "However, even as Trump may want to focus on showing off his golf properties, Starmer will try to center the conversation on more urgent global matters. He plans to urge Trump to press Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and attempt to end what Downing St. called \u201cthe unspeakable suffering and starvation\u201d in the territory, while pushing for a ceasefire in Israel\u2019s war with Hamas.",
      "Britain, along with France and Germany, has criticized Israel for \u201cwithholding essential humanitarian assistance\u201d as hunger spread in Gaza. Over the weekend, Starmer said Britain will take part in efforts led by Jordan to airdrop aid after Israel temporarily eased restrictions.",
      "But British Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged Monday that only the U.S. has \u201cthe leverage\u201d to make a real difference in the conflict.",
      "Still, asked about the crisis in Gaza on Sunday night, Trump was largely dismissive \u2014 focused more on how he\u2019s not personally gotten credit for previous attempts to provide food aid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s terrible. You really at least want to have somebody say, \u2018Thank you,\u2019\u201d Trump said.",
      "The president added, \u201cIt makes you feel a little bad when you do that\" without what he considered proper acknowledgement.",
      "Starmer is under pressure from his Labour Party lawmakers to follow France in recognizing a Palestinian state, a move both Israel and the U.S. have condemned. The British leader says the U.K. supports statehood for the Palestinians but that it must be \u201cpart of a wider plan\u201d for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.",
      "Also on Monday's agenda, according to Starmer\u2019s office, are efforts to promote a possible peace deal to end fighting in Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine \u2014 particularly efforts at forcing Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table in the next 50 days.",
      "Trump in the past sharply criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for also failing to express enough public gratitude toward U.S. support for his country, taking a similar tack he's now adopting when it comes to aid for Gaza. The president, though, has shifted away from that tone and more sharply criticized Putin and Russia in recent weeks.",

Starmer and his country have taken a far softer approach. He's gone out of his way to work with Trump, flattering the president repeatedly during a February visit to the White House, and teaming up to announce a joint trade framework on tariffs for some key products in May.",
      "Starmer and Trump then signed a trade agreement during the G7 summit in Canada that freed the U.K.'s aerospace sector from U.S. tariffs and used quotas to reduce them on auto-related industries from 25% to 10% while increasing the amount of U.S. beef it pledged to import.",
      "Discussions with Starmer follow a Trump meeting Sunday with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at his Turnberry course. They announced a trade framework that will put 15% tariffs on most goods from both countries, though many major details remain pending.",
      "The president has for months railed against yawning U.S. trade deficits around the globe and sees tariffs as a way to try and close them in a hurry. But the U.S. ran an $11.4 billion trade surplus with Britain last year, meaning it exported more to the U.K. than it imported. Census Bureau figures this year indicate that the surplus could grow.",
      "There are still lingering U.S.-Britain trade issues that need fine-tuning. The deal framework from May said British steel would enter the U.S. duty-free, but it continues to face a 25% levy.",

      "Kim Yo Jong\u2019s comments imply that North Korea \u2014 now preoccupied with its expanding cooperation with Russia \u2014 sees no need to resume diplomacy with South Korea and the U.S. anytime soon. Experts say she likely hopes to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington.",
      "\u201cWe clarify once again the official stand that no matter what policy is adopted and whatever proposal is made in Seoul, we have no interest in it and there is neither a reason to meet nor an issue to be discussed,\u201d Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by state media.",

      "Lee's government has halted anti-Pyongyang frontline loudspeaker broadcasts, taken steps to ban activists from flying balloons with propaganda leaflets across the border and repatriated North Koreans who were drifted south in wooden boats months earlier.",
      "North Korea has shunned talks with South Korea and the U.S. since leader Kim Jong Un\u2019s high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over international sanctions. North Korea has since focused on building more powerful nuclear weapons targeting its rivals and declared a hostile \u201ctwo-state\u201d system on the Korean Peninsula to terminate relations with South Korea.",
      "Kim Yo Jong called Lee's steps \u201csincere efforts\u201d to develop ties, but said the new government still plots to \u201cstand in confrontation\u201d with North Korea. She mentioned the upcoming summertime South Korea-U.S. military drills, which North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal.",
      "Lee said it's important to restore trust between the Koreas as he met Unification Minister Chung Dong-young and asked about his thought on the latest North Korean statement. Chung, whose job makes him the top South Korean official on North Korea, later told reporters that he intends to propose to Lee that South Korea and the U.S. \u201cadjust\u201d their military exercises.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Lights flicker, doors hang off their hinges and holes in the walls expose pipes in the apartment building where Hesham, an Egyptian migrant worker, lives in Dubai, an emirate better known for its flashy skyscrapers and penthouses.",

      "But now the government has ordered the 44-year-old salesman out of even that cramped space, which costs him $270 a month. He's one of the many low-paid foreign laborers caught up in a widespread crackdown by authorities in Dubai over illegal subletting.",
      "That includes rooms lined with bunk beds that offer no privacy but are as cheap as a few dollars a night, as well as partitioned apartments like Hesham's, where plywood boards, drywall and plastic shower curtains can turn a flat into a makeshift dormitory for 10 or 20 people.",
      "After a blaze at a high-rise in June, Dubai officials launched the campaign over concerns that partitioned apartments represent a major fire risk. Some of those evicted have been left scrambling to stay off the streets, where begging is illegal. Others fear they could be next, uncertain when or where inspectors might show up.",
      "\u201cNow we don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll do,\u201d said Hesham, who's staying put until his landlord evicts him.

It didn't address where those unable to afford legal housing would live in a city-state that\u2019s synonymous with luxury yet outlaws labor unions and guarantees no minimum wage.",
      "Dubai has seen a boom since the pandemic that shows no signs of stopping. Its population of 3.9 million is projected to grow to 5.8 million by 2040 as more people move into the commercial hub from abroad.",
      "Much of Dubai\u2019s real estate market caters to wealthy foreign professionals living there long-term. That leaves few affordable options for the majority of workers \u2014 migrants on temporary, low-wage contracts, often earning just several hundred dollars a month. Nearly a fifth of homes in Dubai were worth more than $1 million as of last year, property firm Knight Frank said. Developers are racing to build more high-end housing.",
      "That continued growth has meant rising rents across the board. Short-term rentals are expected to cost 18% more by the end of this year compared to 2024, according to online rental company Colife. Most migrant workers the AP spoke to said they make just $300 to $550 a month.",
      "In lower-income areas, they said, a partitioned apartment space generally rents for $220 to $270 a month, while a single bunk in an undivided room costs half as much. Both can cost less if shared, or more depending on size and location. At any rate, they are far cheaper than the average one-bedroom rental, which real estate firm Engel & V\u00f6lkers said runs about $1,400 a month.",

      "The United States and Argentina have announced plans to allow Argentine tourists to travel to the U.S. without a visa",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The United States and Argentina on Monday announced that they are working on a plan to allow Argentine tourists to again travel to the U.S. without a visa.",
      "It will likely take two to three years before visa-free travel becomes a reality for Argentine passport holders, but the signing of a preliminary agreement Monday marked a show of support by the Trump administration for President Javier Milei, its staunchest ally in South America and a darling of conservatives around the world.",
      "The move coincided with a visit by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to Buenos Aires for closed-door meetings with President Milei and his officials. Noem signed the statement of intent alongside Security Minister Patricia Bullrich in Milei's office.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security praised Milei in a statement for reshaping Argentina's foreign policy in line with the U.S.",
      "\u201cUnder President Javier Milei\u2019s leadership, Argentina is becoming an even stronger friend to the United States \u2014 more committed than ever to border security for both of our nations,\u201d the statement quoted Noem as saying, adding that this first step toward Argentina's entry into the Visa Wavier Program \u201chighlights our strong partnership with Argentina and our mutual desire to promote lawful travel while deterring threats.\"",
      "The department cited Argentina as having the lowest visa overstay rate in the U.S. of any Latin American country.",
      "The removal of rigorous U.S. visa restrictions \u2014 particularly at a time when President Donald Trump is tightening restrictions for foreign nationals \u2014 would mark a symbolic victory for Milei, a self-described \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d who rose to power as a far-right outsider mimicking Trump's war-on-woke rhetoric and skillful use of social media.",
      "When he became the first world leader to visit Trump after the U.S. election, Milei pranced around Mar-a-Lago like an excited school boy.",
      "At the Conservative Political Action Committee convention in Washington last February, he gifted billionaire Elon Musk a bureaucracy-slashing chainsaw to support his DOGE campaign to eliminate government waste.",
      "When not riding the far-right, pro-Trump speaking circuit, Milei is focused on straightening out South America\u2019s second-largest economy after years of economic turmoil under left-wing populist rule. Through tough budget cuts and mass layoffs, Milei has succeeded in driving down Argentina's notorious double-digit inflation.",
      "The last time Argentines didn\u2019t require a visa to enter the U.S. was in the 1990s when another free-market devotee, President Carlos Menem, was in power. Menem\u2019s neo-liberal reforms and pegging of the peso 1-to-1 to the U.S. dollar destroyed Argentina\u2019s industry, exacerbating poverty in what a century ago was one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries.",
      "In the economic crisis that followed, the U.S. reimposed visa restrictions in 2002 as young Argentines looking to flee misery lined up at European embassies and stated to migrate illegally to the U.S.",
      "The Argentine presidency described the signing on Monday as a \u201cclear demonstration of the excellent relationship\u201d between Milei and Trump.",

      "The Federal Reserve is expected to leave its short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday for the fifth straight meeting, a move that will likely underscore the deep divide between how Chair Jerome Powell and President Donald Trump see the economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve is expected to leave its short-term interest rate unchanged on Wednesday for the fifth straight meeting, a move that will likely underscore the deep divide between how Chair Jerome Powell and his chief critic, President Donald Trump, see the economy.",
      "The Fed itself, to be sure, is increasingly divided over its next steps, and many economists expect that two members of the Fed's governing board \u2014 both appointed by Trump \u2014 could dissent on Wednesday in favor of cutting rates. If so, that would be the first time two governors vote against the chair since 1993.",
      "Even so, the gap between the views of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee, chaired by Powell, and the White House is unusually large. In several areas, Trump's views sharply contrast with that of the Fed's leadership, setting up likely clashes for years to come, even after Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "For example, Trump says that because the U.S. economy is doing well, the Fed should cut rates, as if the U.S. is a blue-chip company that should pay less to borrow than a risky start-up.",
      "But Fed officials \u2014 and nearly all economists \u2014 see it the other way: A solid economy means rates should be relatively high, to prevent overheating and a burst of inflation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d argue that our interest rates are higher because our economy\u2019s doing fairly well, not in spite of it,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities.",
      "Trump argues that the Fed in general and Powell in particular are costing U.S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars in interest payments by not reducing borrowing costs. Yet Fed officials don't think it's their job to reduce rates the government pays on Treasury notes and bonds.",
      "Most economists worry that if they did, they would risk failing at one of the key jobs Congress gave them: fighting inflation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s using monetary policy to ease pressure on fiscal policymakers, and that way points to higher inflation and bigger problems down the road,\" said William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and former senior Fed staffer.",
      "If financial markets see that the Fed is focused on keeping borrowing costs low to help the government \u2014 rather than focusing on its congressionally-mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment \u2014 Wall Street investors, worried about future inflation, will likely demand higher interest rates to hold Treasury bonds, economists say, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.",
      "For his part, Trump says there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and so the Fed should reduce its short-term rate, currently at about 4.3%, which was ramped up in 2022 and 2023 to fight rising prices. The Fed\u2019s rate often \u2014 but not always \u2014 influences longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards.",
      "Inflation has fallen sharply and as a result Fed officials have signaled they will cut rates by as much as a half-percentage point this year. Yet it has picked up a bit in the last two months and many of those policymakers, including Powell, still want to make sure that tariffs aren't going to lift inflation much higher before they make a move.",
      "Inflation accelerated to 2.7% in June from 2.4% in May, the government said earlier this month, above the Fed's 2% target. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose to 2.9% from 2.8%.",
      "Last week, Trump and several White House officials ramped up their attacks on Powell over rates. They also criticized the ballooning costs of the Fed's renovation of two of its buildings, raising questions over whether the president was looking to fire Powell for cause rather than policy differences.",

      "Yet beyond just the timing of the first cut, there is still a huge gulf between what Trump wants and what the Fed will even consider doing: Fed officials in June penciled in just two reductions this year and one in 2026. They forecast that their key rate will still be 3.6% at the end of next year. Trump is pushing them to cut it to just 1%.",
      "\u201cThat's not going to happen with anything like the current people on the committee,\u201d English said.",

      "HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong conglomerate that had agreed to sell its two ports at the Panama Canal said Monday it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, a move that could please Beijing but bring more U.S. scrutiny to the geopolitically fraught deal.",

    "story": [
      "Morocco\u2019s argan forests are thinning under the strain of climate change, overharvesting and booming demand for luxury cosmetics",
      "SMIMOU, Morocco -- Argan oil runs through your fingers like liquid gold \u2014 hydrating, luscious, and restorative. Prized worldwide as a miracle cosmetic, it\u2019s more than that in Morocco. It\u2019s a lifeline for rural women and a byproduct of a forest slowly buckling under the weight of growing demand.",
      "To make it, women crouch over stone mills and grind down kernels. One kilogram \u2014 roughly two days of work \u2014 earns them around $3, enough for a modest foothold in an economy where opportunities are scarce. It also links them to generations past.",
      "\u201cWe were born and raised here. These traditions come from nature, what our parents and grandparents have taught us and what we\u2019ve inherited,\u201d cooperative worker Fatma Mnir said.",
      "Long a staple in local markets, argan oil today is in luxury hair and skin care products lining drugstore aisles worldwide. But its runaway popularity is threatening argan forests, with overharvesting piled on top of drought straining trees once seen as resilient in the harshest of conditions.",
      "Hafida El Hantati, owner of one of the cooperatives that harvests the fruit and presses it for oil, said the stakes go beyond the trees, threatening cherished traditions.",
      "\u201cWe must take care of this tree and protect it because if we lose it, we will lose everything that defines us and what we have now,\u201d she said at the Ajddigue cooperative outside the coastal town of Essaouira.",
      "For centuries, argan trees have supported life in the arid hills between the Atlantic Ocean and the Atlas Mountains, feeding people and animals, holding soil in place and helping keep the desert from spreading.",
      "The spiny trees can survive in areas with less than an inch of annual rain and heat up to 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit). They endure drought with roots that stretch as far as 115 feet (35 meters) underground. Goats climb trees, chomp their fruit, and eventually disperse seeds as part of the forest's regeneration cycle.",
      "Moroccans stir the oil into nut butters and drizzle it over tagines. Rich in vitamin E, it's lathered onto dry hair and skin to plump, moisturize and stave off damage. Some use it to calm eczema or heal chicken pox.",
      "But the forest has thinned. Trees bear fewer fruit, their branches gnarled from thirst. In many places, cultivated land has replaced them as fields of citrus and tomatoes, many grown for export, have expanded.",
      "Communities once managed forests collectively, setting rules for grazing and harvesting. Now the system is fraying, with theft routinely reported.",
      "But a forest that covered about 5,405 square miles (14,000 square kilometers) at the turn of the century has shrunk by 40%. Scientists warn that argan trees are not invincible.",
      "\u201cBecause argan trees acted as a green curtain protecting a large part of southern Morocco against the encroaching Sahara, their slow disappearance has become considered as an ecological disaster,\u201d said Zoubida Charrouf, a chemist who researches argan at Universit\u00e9 Mohammed V in Rabat.",
      "Shifting climate is a part of the problem. Fruit and flowers sprout earlier each year as rising temperatures push the seasons out of sync.",
      "Goats that help spread seeds can be destructive, too, especially if they feed on seedlings before they mature. Overgrazing has become worse as herders and fruit collectors fleeing drier regions encroach on plots long allocated to specific families.",
      "The forests also face threats from camels bred and raised by the region's wealthy. Camels stretch their necks into trees and chomp entire branches, leaving lasting damage, Charrouf said.",
      "Today, women peel, crack and press argan for oil at hundreds of cooperatives. Much makes its way through middlemen to be sold in products by companies and subsidiaries of L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Unilever, and Est\u00e9e Lauder.",
      "But workers say they earn little while watching profits flow elsewhere. Cooperatives say much of the pressure stems from climbing prices. A 1-liter bottle sells for 600 Moroccan dirhams ($60), up from 25 dirhams ($2.50) three decades ago. Products infused with argan sell for even more abroad. Cosmetics companies call argan the most expensive vegetal oil on the market.",
      "The coronavirus pandemic upended global demand and prices and many cooperatives closed. Cooperative leaders say new competitors have flooded the market just as drought has diminished how much oil can be squeezed from each fruit.",
      "Cooperatives were set up to provide women a base pay and share profits each month. But Union of Women\u2019s Argan Cooperatives President Jamila Id Bourrous said few make more than Morocco\u2019s minimum monthly wage.",
      "\u201cThe people who sell the final product are the ones making the money,\" she said.",

      "On a hill overlooking the Atlantic, a government water truck weaves between rows of trees, pausing to hose saplings that have just started to sprout.",
      "The trees are a project that Morocco began in 2018, planting 39 square miles (100 square kilometers) on private lands abutting the forests. To conserve water and improve soil fertility, argan trees alternate rows with capers, a technique known as intercropping.",
      "The idea is to expand forest cover and show that argan, if properly managed, can be a viable source of income. Officials hope it will ease pressure on the overharvested commons and convince others to reinvest in the land. The trees were expected to begin producing this year but haven't during a drought.",
      "Another issue is the supply chain.",
      "\u201cBetween the woman in the village and the final buyer, there are four intermediaries. Each takes a cut. The cooperatives can\u2019t afford to store, so they sell cheap to someone who pays upfront,\u201d Id Bourrous, the union president, said.",
      "The government has attempted to build storage centers to help producers hold onto their goods longer and negotiate better deals. So far, cooperatives say it hasn\u2019t worked, but a new version is expected in 2026 with fewer barriers to access.",
      "Despite problems, there's money to be made.",
      "During harvest season, women walk into the forest with sacks, scanning the ground for fallen fruit. To El Hantati, the forest, once thick and humming with life, feels quieter now. Only the winds and creaking trees are audible as goats climb branches in search of remaining fruits and leaves.",

      "U.S. and Chinese officials are meeting in Stockholm to discuss trade tariffs.",
      "WASHINGTON -- When top U.S. and Chinese officials meet in Stockholm, they are almost certain to agree to at least leaving tariffs at the current levels while working toward a meeting between their presidents later this year for a more lasting trade deal between the world's two largest economies, analysts say.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are set to hold talks Monday for the third time this year \u2014 this round in the Swedish capital, nearly four months after President Donald Trump upset global trade with his sweeping tariff proposal, including an import tax that shot up to 145% on Chinese goods.",
      "\u201cWe have the confines of a deal with China,\u201d Trump said Friday before leaving for Scotland.",
      "Bessent told MSNBC on Wednesday that the two countries after talks in Geneva and London have reached a \u201cstatus quo,\u201d with the U.S. taxing imported goods from China at 30% and China responding with a 10% tariff, on top of tariffs prior to the start of Trump's second term.",
      "\u201cNow we can move on to discussing other matters in terms of bringing the economic relationship into balance,\u201d Bessent said. He was referring to the U.S. running a $295.5 billion trade deficit last year. The U.S. seeks an agreement that would enable it to export more to China and shift the Chinese economy more toward domestic consumer spending.",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington said Beijing hopes \u201cthere will be more consensus and cooperation and less misperception\u201d coming out of the talks.",
      "With an eye on a possible leaders' summit, Stockholm could provide some answers as to the timeline and viability of that particular goal ahead of a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "\u201cThe meeting will be important in starting to set the stage for a fall meeting between Trump and Xi,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade negotiator and now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cBeijing will likely insist on detailed preparations before they agree to a leaders\u2019 meeting.\u201d",
      "In Stockholm, the two sides are likely to focus on commercial announcements to be made at a leaders\u2019 summit as well as agreements to address \u201cmajor irritants,\u201d such as China's industrial overcapacity and its lack of control over chemicals used to make fentanyl, also to be announced when Xi and Trump should meet, Cutler said.",
      "Sean Stein, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, said Stockholm could be the first real opportunity for the two governments to address structural reform issues including market access in China for U.S. companies.",
      "What businesses will be seeking coming out of Stockholm would largely be \u201cthe atmosphere\u201d \u2014 how the two sides characterize the discussions. They will also look for clues about a possible leaders\u2019 summit because any real deal will hinge on the two presidents meeting each other, he said.",
      "In Stockholm, Beijing will likely demand the removal of the 20% fentanyl-related tariff that Trump imposed earlier this year, said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based Stimson Center.",
      "This round of the U.S.-China trade dispute began with fentanyl, when Trump in February imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, citing that China failed to curb the outflow of the chemicals used to make the drug. The following month, Trump added another 10% tax for the same reason. Beijing retaliated with extra duties on some U.S. goods, including coal, liquefied natural gas, and farm products such as beef, chicken, pork and soy.",
      "In Geneva, both sides climbed down from three-digit tariffs rolled out following Trump's \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs in April, but the U.S. kept the 20% \u201cfentanyl\u201d tariffs, in addition to the 10% baseline rate \u2014 to which China responded by keeping the same 10% rate on U.S. products. These across-the-board duties were unchanged when the two sides met in London a month later to negotiate over non-tariff measures such as export controls on critical products.",
      "The Chinese government has long protested that American politicians blame China for the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. but argued the root problem lies with the U.S. itself. Washington says Beijing is not doing enough to regulate precursor chemicals that flow out of China into the hands of drug dealers.",
      "In July, China placed two fentanyl ingredients under enhanced control, a move seen as in response to U.S. pressure and signaling goodwill.",

This would likely face political pushback in Washington.",

      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng were meeting at the offices of Sweden\u2019s prime minister for two days of talks that Bessent has said will likely lead to an extension of current tariff levels. But other possible outcomes will be scrutinized.",
      "Analysts say the talks could set the stage for a possible meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year.",
      "The U.S.-China trade talks are the third this year, nearly four months after Trump upended global trade with his sweeping tariff proposals, including an import tax that shot up to 145% on Chinese goods. China retaliated with tariffs reaching 125% against U.S. goods, sending global financial markets into a temporary tailspin.",
      "The Stockholm meeting, following similar talks in Geneva and London, is set to extend a 90-day pause on those tariffs. During the pause, U.S. tariffs have been lowered to 30% on Chinese goods, and China set a 10% tariff on U.S. products.",

      "Experts say long-term progress in the U.S.-China trade relationship will hinge on structural changes. Those include increased manufacturing in the United States, which is part of Trump\u2019s ambition. On the Chinese side, that could involve a reduction of excess Chinese production in many industries, including electric vehicles and steel, and increased Chinese consumer spending to ease imbalances in China\u2019s export-driven economy.",

      "GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Ed Policy began his tenure as the Green Bay Packers\u2019 president/CEO by paying tribute to his predecessor.",
      "Policy officially took over for Mark Murphy on Friday as the NFL\u2019s only publicly owned franchise held its annual shareholders meeting. During Murphy\u2019s 17 seasons on the job, the Packers made 13 playoff appearances, with the 2010 team winning a Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cI assure you that going forward I\u2019m going to lean heavily on your example and your pearls of wisdom as I move the organization into the future,\u201d Policy said.",
      "Murphy is stepping down because he reached the franchise\u2019s mandatory retirement age of 70 earlier this month. Murphy said he felt he could continue meeting the demands of this position but added that he agrees with the Packers\u2019 retirement policy.",
      "\u201cIn my career \u2013 business and with the league and others \u2013 you see examples where maybe people stay on a little too long, so I think this serves the Packers well,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Policy, 54, didn\u2019t focus much on his own plans during the shareholders meeting, which instead pretty much served as a testimonial for Murphy.",
      "There were plenty of shouts of \u201cThank you, Mark,\u201d among the 6,529 shareholders in the Lambeau Field stands. On a hot afternoon, many shareholders tried to cool themselves off by waving fans that featured Murphy\u2019s face. A tribute video included messages from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and former commissioner Paul Tagliabue among others.",
      "Murphy signed autographs and greeted fans after the Packers\u2019 Friday morning practice and again after the shareholders meeting.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bittersweet,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m a very appreciative and I also feel honored, too, that the fans have been so supportive of me and the organization. But (I\u2019m) really excited too for the future of the organization and for Ed in particular.\u201d",
      "The Packers say Murphy, who played defensive back for Washington from 1977-84, is believed to be the only person to earn a Super Bowl ring both as a player and as a team\u2019s chief executive. He was on Washington\u2019s 1982 championship team.",
      "His stint as Green Bay\u2019s president/CEO included the construction of Titletown, a 45-acre development adjacent to Lambeau Field that features shops, restaurants and apartments.",
      "He capped his tenure earlier this year by welcoming the NFL Draft to Green Bay, an event that drew an announced three-day total attendance of 600,000. Murphy also presided over multiple renovations to Lambeau Field, including the opening of a new home locker room this week.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been tremendous for us,\u201d wide receiver Jayden Reed said. \u201cI thanked him today, knowing this was his last day here, so I went up to him and I thanked him for everything. Without him, we wouldn\u2019t be standing in this locker room right now. He\u2019s been a tremendous help to all of us, very supportive. He gets this thing done. I appreciate him for that.\u201d",

      "The import tax that began July 14 is just the latest protectionist move by an administration that has threatened dozens of countries with tariffs, including its critical trading partner Mexico. It comes as the Mexican government tries to also negotiate its way out of a 30% general tariff scheduled to take effect Aug. 1.",

      "Southern California Edison has announced it will create a program to compensate victims of January\u2019s devastating Eaton Fire near Los Angeles",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Southern California Edison announced this week that it will create a program to compensate victims of January\u2019s devastating Eaton Fire near Los Angeles, even as the cause of the blaze that killed 19 people remains under investigation.",
      "The creation of the Wildfire Recovery Compensation Program seems to suggest that the utility is prepared to acknowledge what several lawsuits claim: that its equipmentsparked the conflagration in Altadena.",
      "\u201cEven though the details of how the Eaton Fire started are still being evaluated, SCE will offer an expedited process to pay and resolve claims fairly and promptly,\u201d Pedro Pizarro, chief executive of Edison International, the utility\u2019s parent company, said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThis allows the community to focus more on recovery instead of lengthy, expensive litigation.\u201d",
      "Officials haven\u2019t said what caused the fire that destroyed more than 9,400 homes and other structures.",
      "It is not clear how much money the utility will contribute to the program. A lawsuit filed by Los Angeles County in March claims that costs and damage estimates were expected to total hundreds of millions of dollars, with assessments ongoing.",
      "SCE said the compensation program, which will go into effect this fall, would be open to those who lost homes, rental properties or businesses. It would also cover those who suffered injuries, were harmed by smoke or had family members who were killed.",
      "Among those suing SCE is EJ Soto, whose rental home in Altadena where she grew up was destroyed by flames. She first heard about the program on the news.",
      "She said she considers the program's creation as a \u201cform of admission\u201d from the utility that its equipment caused the inferno. Soto worries that her family will receive \u201cpennies on the dollar\u201d and said the utility is trying to get out ahead of future lawsuits.",
      "\u201cAll our memories are there, places we raised our children. Money won't bring that back. They need to know that our pain is greater than that,\u201d Soto said Thursday.",

      "LA County previously won more than $64 million in a settlement with Southern California Edison over the 2018 Woolsey Fire. Investigators determined SCE's equipment sparked that blaze, and the utility also paid more than $2 billion to settle related insurance claims.",
      "Utility equipment has sparked some of the deadliest and most destructive fires in state history in recent years.",
      "LA Fire Justice, which advocates for wildfire victims, said in a statement Thursday that the SCE program\u2019s creation shows that the utility is prepared to accept responsibility. But the nonprofit said a fund by Pacific Gas & Electric following wildfires in Northern California was slow to roll out and inefficient.",
      "\u201cExperience suggests that these direct payments for victims are neither quick, nor easy, nor equitable. PG&E offered a similar program and wildfire victims ended up receiving inadequate compensation, and it didn\u2019t happen fast,\u201d said Doug Boxer, an attorney for LA Fire Justice.",
      "Investigators are also working to determine the cause of the Palisades Fire, which broke out shortly before the Eaton Fire and killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of structures in Los Angeles.",

      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help",
      "NEW YORK -- After five years of working long nights as a truck driver, Julius Mosley wanted a change. He found driving unfulfilling, and his teenage son needed him to spend more time at home.",
      "So Mosley took a job as a customer service representative at a telecommunications company near his home. The employee benefits included being able to take job-related classes for free. He decided he wanted to study leadership so he could learn about managing teams and helping people become the best versions of themselves.",
      "His company, Spectrum, paid for a 10-week front-line manager certificate program that Mosley went on to complete. Then it covered the tuition cost for a bachelor's degree in leadership and organization studies that he's currently pursuing. The company also promoted him to a management position while he took college courses online.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s completely changed the course of my life,\u201d Mosley said about the education benefit, which took care of his tuition up front instead of requiring him to pay and seek later reimbursement. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a blessing to be able to do this.\u201d",
      "As higher education costs have grown to heights many U.S. residents find unattainable or illogical, some adults are looking to their employers for help defraying the expense of college and professional credentials. Nearly half of public and private employers have a tuition reimbursement program for employees, according to the Society for Human Resource Management, or SHRM.",
      "Many employers that provide tuition assistance reimburse staff members up to $5,250 per year because that amount is tax-deductible, said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute, which offers credentials to HR professionals.",
      "Some companies offer more, including Bank of America, which provides tuition assistance of up to $7,500 annually, and Spectrum which, in addition to its prepaid tuition program, reimburses employees earning master's degrees or enrolled in classes that fall outside the scope of its prepaid program up to $10,000 per year.",
      "\"For companies who are looking to attract Generation Z and Millennials, it\u2019s a great way to bring them in because they\u2019re keenly interested in how companies are investing in them and the benefits that are available,\" said Dufrane.",
      "Because many college graduates start jobs after accumulating student loan debt, about 8% of employers also offer help with student loan repayment, according to James Atkinson, vice president of thought leadership at SHRM.",
      "If continuing education feels out of reach financially or seems incompatible with job demands, experts say there are ways to explore the possibility, either by by making the case to your employer or seeking a position at a place that provides education benefits.",
      "In traditional tuition reimbursement programs, employees lay out thousands of dollars to pay for tuition, books and fees at the start of a semester, and usually must complete the course with a passing grade before a company would kick in its contribution.",
      "That means employees would often wait four to six months before being reimbursed, which only works for more affluent workers, said Paul Marchand, chief human resources officer at Spectrum.",
      "\u201cThe person that can afford to put it on their credit card and sit with $3- or $4- or $5,000 of expenses due back to them and not be concerned about that cost, that is not our average worker,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cOur average worker is making $25, $28, $30 bucks an hour, maybe having a second job, maybe a single parent with kids, ... and they\u2019re important workers for us, and we want to help develop them and grow their careers.\u201d",
      "Spectrum launched a program that lets employees sign up for an array of certificates or college courses while paying nothing themselves. The eligible courses and where to take them came from Guild, a Denver company that works with employers on workforce development and tuition assistance.",
      "Walmart offers a similar benefit to its front-line associates, who can enroll in college or certain classes without ever seeing an invoice, according to company spokesperson Jimmy Carter. The benefit also extends to family members of the employees, he said.",
      "As recent college graduates have struggled with debts from college, some employers have added student loan repayment programs as well as tuition assistance.",

      "\u201cThe fact that I\u2019m now ahead of where I thought I would be a little over a year ago is very nice to see,\u201d she said.",
      "Not all employers offer education benefits, and when they do, they're not always widely publicized. To find out if your employer offers such benefits, ask a manager or a human resources representative.",
      "Show how a course or training directly relates to your role and how it would help you do your job more effectively, Dufrane advised. Even if there's no formal tuition reimbursement program, your employer might have a training or professional development budget.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re taking on a stretch role or entering a new industry, you can advocate for training as part of your offer. Say something like, \u2018I\u2019d like to take a course to help me get up to speed in this area.\u2019 In my experience, that shows initiative and employers often respect it,\u201d Dufrane said.",

To manage his time, he switched to working Monday through Thursday, studied on weeknights and dedicated Friday through Sunday to other schoolwork.",
      "\u201cWithout the tuition reimbursement or the organization\u2019s flexibility, there\u2019s no way that I would be able to\u201d earn advanced degrees, said Sotolongo, who is now pursuing a PhD with assistance from HRCI. \u201cIt\u2019s rewarding in every aspect.\u201d",
      "Providing flexibility shows commitment to employees, Dufrane said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be flexible around learning because people have parents they\u2019re taking care of and kids they're taking care of, and going home at night isn\u2019t always the best time to be writing a paper,\u201d she said.",
      "Fitting in schoolwork while also meeting the needs of a son, a fiancee, a full-time job and a puppy has been challenging for Mosley, but it also provided a way to model studious behavior for his son.",
      "\u201cInstead of me just telling him he needs to do his, now he\u2019s seeing me doing schoolwork, so that actually helped out with him wanting to do his work more,\" Mosley said. \"We actually take time to sit down together some days to work on our homework, so it\u2019s been a life-changing situation.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump has announced trade deals with Japan and a handful of other Asian countries that will relieve some pressure on companies and consumers from sharply higher tariffs on their exports to the United States.",
      "A deal with China is under negotiation, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying an Aug. 12 deadline might be postponed again to allow more time for talks.",
      "Steep tariffs on U.S. imports of steel and aluminum remain, however, and many other countries, including South Korea and Thailand, have yet to clinch agreements. Overall, economists say the tariffs inevitably will dent growth in Asia and the world.",
      "Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced a deal Wednesday that will impose 15% tariffs on U.S. imports from Japan, down from Trump's proposed 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.",
      "It was a huge relief for automakers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda, whose shares jumped by double digits in Tokyo. Trump also announced trade deals with the Philippines and Indonesia. After meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., Trump said the import tax on products from his country would be subject to a 19% tariff, down just 1% from the earlier threat of a 20% tariff.",
      "Indonesia also will face a 19% tariff, down from the 32% rate Trump had recently said would apply, and it committed to eliminating nearly all of its trade barriers for imports of American goods. Earlier, Trump announced that Vietnam's exports would face a 20% tariff, with double that rate for goods transshipped from China, though there has been no formal announcement.",
      "Negotiations with China are subject to an Aug. 12 deadline, but it's likely to be extended, Bessent told Fox Business on Tuesday. He said the two sides were due to hold another round of talks, this time in Sweden, early next week. Meanwhile, Trump said a trip to China may happen soon, hinting at efforts to stabilize U.S.-China trade relations.",
      "A preliminary agreement announced in June paved the way for China to lift some restrictions on its exports of rare earths, minerals critical for high technology and other manufacturing. In May, the U.S. agreed to drop Trump's 145% tariff rate on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days, while China agreed to lower its 125% rate on U.S. goods to 10%. The reprieve allowed companies more time to rush to try to beat the potentially higher tariffs, giving a boost to Chinese exports and alleviating some of the pressure on its manufacturing sector. But prolonged uncertainty over what Trump might do has left companies wary about committing to further investment in China.",

Imports from Myanmar and Laos would be taxed at 40%, Cambodia and Thailand at 36%, Serbia and Bangladesh at 35%, South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina at 30% and Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Tunisia at 25%.

      "\u201cIt was dynamic. It was tough. It wasn\u2019t a cakewalk. It wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Sanders, who arrived to his news conference wearing a cowboy hat and overalls along with sunglasses, which he took off after getting choked up. \u201cThat was a fight, but we made it.\u201d",
      "Sanders, who turns 58 next month, spoke on the eve of fall camp as he enters his third season overseeing the Buffaloes. He brought his medical team with him to discuss his diagnosis. A section of his intestine was reconstructed to function as a bladder. He won't need any radiation or chemotherapy, Kukreja said.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018C\u2019 word, when we hear that word there\u2019s normally a life sentence attached to it,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut not this time. But not this time.\u201d",
      "Sanders said he lost about 25 pounds, leading him to joke, \u201cI was like Atlanta Falcons Prime at one point.\u201d",
      "Just Sanders being Sanders \u2014 he remained upbeat throughout the entire process, his medical team said.",
      "\u201cHe never folded one time and never wavered,\u201d team trainer Lauren Askevold said. \"You couldn\u2019t ask for a better patient because he wants to get up and get going right. So it\u2019s been awesome. It\u2019s been a hectic journey, but there\u2019s a blessing very in disguise with all this.\u201d",
      "Never once did Sanders waver in his belief that he would return to the sideline.",
      "\u201cI always knew I was going to coach again. It was never in my spirit, in my heart, that God wouldn\u2019t allow me to coach again,\u201d he said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to be running down to the hospital once a week when I have all of this on my plate. I don\u2019t want that. I was like, \u2018OK, can they bring one of those machines and put them in the office?\u2019\u201d",
      "Athletic director Rick George echoed Sanders.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s so positive, and he said he\u2019d be back,\u201d George said. \u201cI had every confidence that he would be.\u201d",
      "While he dealt with the cancer diagnosis, Sanders said he had plenty of friends and family members check in on him. Among those who reached out was Pro Football Hall of Fame wide receiver Randy Moss, who took a leave of absence from ESPN in early December after having surgery for cancer.",

      "Sanders stressed over and over the importance of early detection. His cancer was discovered when he went for an annual CT scan as a precaution given his history with blood clots.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re lucky to have found it at this stage where I could say the word cure,\u201d Kukreja said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t use that word lightly as a cancer doctor.\u201d",
      "The charismatic coach returned to campus last week and announced on social media, \u201cBack and Feeling Great!\u201d He has missed football camps in Boulder this summer amid reports that he\u2019s been ill.",
      "On Sunday, the production crew of \u201cWell Off Media,\u201d which chronicles Sanders and the Buffaloes, posted a video on YouTube of the coach\u2019s first meeting with the team. In the middle of the clip, there was a scene, dated May 9, where Sanders said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready mentally, emotionally. Last night was tough, yesterday was tough, because I had to make a will. That\u2019s not easy at all, to think that you may not be here.\u201d",
      "Sanders used humor Monday to talk about drafting a will, saying it was a chance to rank his kids. Jokes aside, he added: \"You don\u2019t want to be a fool and leave and not have your business affairs in order.\u201d",
      "Sanders has dealt with other health issues. Many of them have involved his left foot since having two toes amputated in 2021 because of blood clot issues while he was coaching at Jackson State. He missed media day in 2023, his inaugural year at Colorado, after a procedure to remove a blood clot from his right leg and another to straighten toes on his left foot.",
      "In March, Sanders signed a contract extension through the 2029 season.",
      "The Buffaloes kick off the season on Aug. 29 against Georgia Tech at Folsom Field. It will be the first season in quite some time that he hasn\u2019t coached one of his sons. Quarterback Shedeur Sanders was drafted by the Cleveland Browns while Shilo, a safety, is in camp with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.",
      "Deion Sanders and the Buffaloes went 4-8 in his first season and 9-4 last season, with an appearance in the Alamo Bowl. They have big shoes to fill in replacing Shedeur Sanders and Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter.",

      "Eric Allen, known for his exceptional career as a cornerback, is being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame",
      "Among all of the impressive accomplishments that helped Eric Allen make it to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the fact that he maintained his elite level of play so he never had to move from cornerback in his 14 seasons stands out.",
      "From his first game as a rookie as part of Buddy Ryan's fierce defenses in Philadelphia in 1988 to his final game as a savvy veteran for the Oakland Raiders in 2001, Allen shut down opposing receivers as well as anybody.",
      "\u201cI take tremendous pride in that,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut to be able to be on the corner from day one to the last game of my career, being a starter and being an effective player, it means a lot. ... I\u2019m not a DB, I\u2019m a corner. I\u2019m not going to be all snobby. But it\u2019s different positions.\u201d",
      "And few played it as well as Allen and now he had gotten the ultimate recognition when he will be officially inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, on Saturday.",
      "\"I played against a lot of really good corners. I think Eric was one of the smartest I\u2019ve played against,\" said Rich Gannon, who played against Allen early in his career and was a teammate at the end with the Raiders when Allen and Charles Woodson would match up against Jerry Rice and Tim Brown in heated practice sessions.",
      "\u201cHe was really clever. He jumped certain routes, recognized certain things. He\u2019s one of those guys, if you\u2019re going to throw in his direction, you better see him. You just can\u2019t put your foot in the ground and think the receiver\u2019s got separation. He\u2019d bait you. He\u2019d act like he got beat or he was off. He had great recovery skill, good recovery speed. There just wasn\u2019t a lot of weakness in his game.\u201d",
      "Allen credits his preparation for his success that included six Pro Bowl berths, one All-Pro selection in 1989, two second-team selections and 54 interceptions.",
      "Allen grew up playing both ways and envisioned himself as being Marcus Allen, growing up in San Diego. Those running back skills paid dividends in the NFL with nine interceptions returned for touchdowns, including one in a playoff win for Philadelphia over New Orleans in the 1992 season and a league-leading four in the 1993 season alone.",
      "\"That always seemed like a requirement for the position, don\u2019t just intercept it but when you catch it, run. That\u2019s your opportunity to show your moves,\" he said. \u201cSo when you get the ball, it\u2019s your time to turn to Marcus Allen. It was a requirement. If you play the cornerback, if you catch the ball and you get to try and score.\u201d",
      "Allen\u2019s career started in Philadelphia in 1988 with his rookie season ending with a playoff loss in the famous \u201cFog Bowl\u201d game at Chicago. It ended with another famous playoff loss when the Raiders lost to New England in the \u201cTuck Rule\u201d game following the 2001 season.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI talk about that a lot too. Two things that were definitely beyond our control.\u201d",

      "Allen told linebacker William Thomas to cover the first open widow and Allen was there to jump the route if Brady waited \u2014 which is exactly what happened but Woodson forced what was called a fumble on the field only to get overturned on a replay that still haunts the Raiders from that game today.",
      "When coach Jon Gruden was traded away from Oakland a few weeks later, Allen decided it was time to retire and missed the Raiders run to the Super Bowl in 2002.",
      "\u201cI just thought that was maybe the perfect time to book end my career,\u201d he said.",
      "All that was left was the wait for the call from the Hall of Fame that came earlier this year when former Arizona State teammate Randall McDaniel delivered the news.",
      "\u201cThe people around me, my circle, it really kind of relieved for them,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI was never panicked or ever in a situation where, oh, man, I\u2019m not going to get in. I came to peace about this a long time ago, Whenever I get in will be perfect.\u201d",

      "IRVINE, Scotland -- Lottie Woad had four birdies in a six-hole stretch around the turn and posted a 5-under 67 on Saturday to maintain her two-shot lead in the Women's Scottish Open as she closes in on victory in her professional debut.",
      "Woad has such control of her game at Dundonald Links that she went 33 consecutive holes without a bogey until dropping a shot on the 15th.",
      "Her lead was down to one shot, but the 21-year-old from England responded with a short wedge she played perfectly on the 17th, leaving her an 8-foot birdie putt she converted. A closing par put her at 17-under 199.",
      "Nanna Koerstz Madsen of Denmark, who caught Woad early with an eagle on the par-5 third hole, fell behind after Woad's birdie streak. But the Dane rallied with three straight birdies and a couple of par saves for a 67.",
      "She was two shots behind, along with Sei Young Kim (66), who made a long eagle putt on the 14th and got up-and-down for birdie on the par-5 closing hole to get within two shots.",
      "Nelly Korda played bogey-free, but the American managed only two birdies on another relatively calm day by Scottish standards. Her 70 left her five shots behind Woad, who already has had a golden summer in Europe.",
      "Woad, who won the Augusta National Women's Amateur in 2024 and rose to No. 1 in the women's amateur ranking that year, won the Irish Women's Open three weeks ago on the Ladies European Tour.",
      "Then she missed the playoff by one shot in the Evian Championship. But her tie for third in the LPGA major earned her a tour card, and she decided to skip her senior year at Florida State and turn pro. And now she has a chance to win in her debut.",
      "\u201cThat's the aim, to shoot as low as possible and keep giving myself chances,\u201d Woad said. \u201cIf someone shoots lights out, fair enough. I'm excited for the opportunity. I've got the experience and I'll try to use that.\u201d",

      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- An artificial intelligence data center that would use more electricity than every home in Wyoming combined before expanding to as much as five times that size will be built soon near Cheyenne, according to the city's mayor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a game changer. It\u2019s huge,\u201d Mayor Patrick Collins said Monday.",

      "Accounting for fossil fuels, Wyoming produces about 12 times more energy than it consumes. The state exports almost three-fifths of the electricity it produces, according to the EIA.",
      "But this proposed data center is so big, it would have its own dedicated energy from gas generation and renewable sources, according to Collins and company officials.",
      "Gov. Mark Gordon praised the project's value to the state's gas industry.",
      "\u201cThis is exciting news for Wyoming and for Wyoming natural gas producers,\" Gordon said in the statement.",
      "While data centers are energy-hungry, experts say companies can help reduce their effect on the climate by powering them with renewable energy rather than fossil fuels. Even so, electricity customers might see their bills increase as utilities plan for massive data projects on the grid.",
      "The data center would be built several miles (kilometers) south of Cheyenne off U.S. 85 near the Colorado state line. State and local regulators would need to sign off on the project, but Collins was optimistic construction could begin soon.",

    "story": [
      "Fishing for krill near Antarctica has surged to a record high, nearing a seasonal catch limit that could close the fishery early",
      "MIAMI -- Trawling near Antarctica for krill \u2014 a crustacean central to the diet of whales and a critical buffer to global warming \u2014 has surged to a record and is fast approaching a never before reached seasonal catch limit that would trigger the unprecedented early closure of the remote fishery, The Associated Press has learned.",
      "The fishing boom follows the failure last year of the U.S., Russia, China and two dozen other governments to approve a new management plan that would have mandated spreading out the area in which krill can be caught and creating a California-sized reserve along the environmentally sensitive Antarctic Peninsula.",
      "In the first seven months of the 2024-25 season, krill fishing in Antarctica reached 518,568 tons, about 84% of the 620,000-ton limit that, once reached, will force the fishery to automatically close. In one hot spot, the catch through June 30 was nearly 60% higher than all of last year\u2019s haul, according to a report from the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CCAMLR, the international organization that manages the world's southernmost fishery.",
      "The report, which has not been publicly released and CCAMLR said contains confidential data, was shared with The AP by someone concerned about overfishing in Antarctica on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of the krill take is from an increasingly smaller area,\u201d said Capt. Peter Hammarstedt, campaign director for conservation group Sea Shepherd Global, which this year made its third voyage to Antarctica to document the fishery. \u201cIt\u2019s the equivalent of a hunter saying that they\u2019re only killing 1% of the U.S.\u2019 deer population but leaving out that all of the deer were shot in Rhode Island.\u201d",
      "Krill is one of the most abundant marine species in the world, with an estimated biomass of 63 million metric tons. But advances in fishing, climate change and growing demand for krill\u2019s Omega-3 rich oil \u2013 for fishmeal, pet food and human dietary supplements \u2014 have increased pressure on the krill stocks. In the 2023-24 season, a fleet of 12 industrial trawlers from mostly Norway and China caught 498,350 tons of krill \u2014 until now the largest harvest since CCAMLR began collecting catch data in 1973.",
      "AP journalists traveled to the icy waters around Antarctica in 2023 and observed how factory ships trawl in close proximity to whales whose numbers are still recovering from a century of industrial culling that nearly drove them to extinction.",
      "Underscoring the competition between humans and whales, three humpback whales were found dead or seriously injured last year in the long, cylindrical nets deployed by the vessels to vacuum up the paper-clip sized crustacean.",
      "Officials have been negotiating for years a new management plan that would balance the growing market for krill with calls for greater protection of the Antarctic Peninsula, the continent's northernmost point and an area teeming with whales and, increasingly, tourists. Currently, less than 5% of the Southern Ocean is protected \u2014 well behind CCAMLR\u2019s target and a United Nations goal to preserve 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030.",
      "But a tentative deal fell apart at last year\u2019s CCAMLR meeting over a last minute proposal by the United Kingdom and Australia for an even lower catch limit than the one agreed to during talks, AP reported last year. China, objecting to the persistent Western demands, then withdrew its support for the marine reserve and refused to renew the existing management system.",
      "\u201cThe truth was it was the UK,\u201d Matts Johansen, chief executive of Norway's Aker BioMarine, the world's largest supplier of krill-based products, said at the United Nations Oceans conference in June. \u201cJust a couple days before the vote, the UK threw another suggestion and that's when the Chinese backed off.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office rejected that characterization and said the British government continues to push for a krill management strategy that better safeguards Antarctic marine species and vulnerable ecosystems.",
      "In the absence of a deal, restrictions adopted 15 years ago to spread out the catch limit expired, allowing the krill fleet to essentially fish anywhere at any time, including in smaller habitats preferred by whales and other animals such as penguins and seals.",

Activity in one popular fishing ground, denoted Sub-Area 48.1, appears to have more than doubled so far this season compared to the entire 2023-2024 season, according to the the U.S.-based group, which supports sustainable fishing.",
      "Javier Arata, the executive director the Association of Responsible Krill harvesting companies, whose members are responsible for 95% of the krill taken from Antarctica, said the catch limit that lapsed was always intended as an interim measure.",
      "His group supports the creation of marine protected areas in Antarctica. But it rejects waiting for a conservation deal to adopt \u201cready-to-go measures\u201d raising the quota, which he said can be much higher.",

      "Scientists in Mexico are testing innovative methods they hope can be employed to locate the overwhelming number of people missing due to cartel violence",
      "ZAPOPAN, Mexico -- First the scientists dress dead swine in clothes, then they dispose of the carcasses. Some they wrap in packing tape, others they chop up. They stuff the animals into plastic bags or wrap them in blankets. They cover them in lime or burn them. Some are buried alone, others in groups.",

      "Families of the missing are usually left to look for their loved ones with little support from authorities. But now, government scientists are testing the newest satellite, geophysical and biological mapping techniques \u2014 along with the pigs \u2014 to offer clues that they hope could lead to the discovery of at least some of the bodies.",
      "The ranks of Mexico\u2019s missing exploded in the years following the launch of then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s war against drug cartels in 2006. A strategy that targeted the leaders of a handful of powerful cartels led to a splintering of organized crime and the multiplication of violence to control territory.",
      "With near complete impunity, owing to the complicity or inaction of the authorities, cartels found that making anyone they think is in their way disappear was better than leaving bodies in the street. Mexican administrations have sometimes been unwilling to recognize the problem and at other times are staggered by the scale of violence their justice system is unprepared to address.",
      "Mexico\u2019s disappeared could populate a small city. Official data in 2013 tallied 26,000 missing, but the count now surpasses 130,000 \u2014 more than any other Latin American nation. The United Nations has said there are indications that the disappearances are \u201cgeneralized or systematic.\u201d",
      "If the missing people are found \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 it is usually by their loved ones. Guided by information from witnesses, parents and siblings search for graves by walking through cartel territory, plunging a metal rod into the earth and sniffing for the scent of death.",
      "Around 6,000 clandestine graves have been found since 2007, and new discoveries are made all the time. Tens of thousands of remains have yet to be identified.",
      "Jalisco, which is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, has the largest number of people reported missing in Mexico: 15,500. In March, human bone fragments and hundreds of items of clothing were discovered at a cartel ranch in the state. Authorities denied it was the site of a mass grave.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Luis Silv\u00e1n, a coordinator of the mapping project and scientist at CentroGeo, a federal research institute focused on geospacial information, said Jalisco\u2019s disappeared are \u201cwhy we\u2019re here.\u201d",
      "The mapping project, launched in 2023, is a collaboration by Guadalajara University, Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University and the University of Oxford in England, alongside the Jalisco Search Commission, a state agency that organizes local searches with relatives.",
      "\u201cNo other country is pushing so strongly, so creatively\" to test and combine new techniques, said Derek Congram, a Canadian forensic anthropologist, whose expertise in geographic information systems inspired the Mexican project.",

Generally used by mining companies, the camera measures light reflected by substances in the soil, including nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, and shows how they vary as the pigs decompose. The colorful image it produces offers clues of what to look for in the hunt for graves.",

One set of graves is encased behind a pane of transparent acrylic, providing a window for scientists to observe the pigs\u2019 decomposition in real time.",

      "Each grave is a living \u201cmicro ecosystem,\u201d said Tunuari Ch\u00e1vez, the commission's director of context analysis.",
      "Triggered by the disappearance of 43 students in 2014, Silv\u00e1n and his colleagues started gathering information about ground-penetrating radar, electric resistivity and satellite imagery from around the world. They studied University of Tennessee research on human corpses buried at a \u201cbody farm.\u201d They looked at grave-mapping techniques used in the Balkans, Colombia and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cWhat good is science or technology if it doesn\u2019t solve problems?\u201d he said.",
      "They learned new applications of satellite analysis, then began their first experiments burying pigs and studying the substances criminals use to dispose of bodies. They found lime is easily detected, but hydrocarbons, hydrochloric acid and burned flesh are not.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s team worked to combine the science with what they knew about how the cartels operate. For example, they determined that disappearances in Jalisco commonly happened along cartel routes between Pacific ports, drug manufacturing facilities and the U.S. border, and that most of the missing are found in the same municipality where they disappeared.",
      "The experience of the families of the missing also informs the research.",
      "Some observed that graves are often found under trees whose roots grow vertically, so those digging the graves can remain in the shade. Mothers of missing loved ones invited by researchers to visit one of the pig burial sites were able to identify most of the unmarked graves by sight alone, because of the plants and soil placement, Silv\u00e1n said.",

      "H\u00e9ctor Flores has been searching for his son since 2021. He questions why so much time and effort has been invested in methods that have not led to concrete discoveries, when the families have proven track records with little official support.",
      "Although the research has not yet concluded, the Jalisco Search Commission is already using a thermal drone, a laser scanner and a multispectral camera to help families look for their missing relatives in some cases. But it is unclear whether authorities across Mexico will ever be willing to use, or able to afford, the high-tech aides.",

      "People with experimental brain implants often turn to the treatment as a last resort, hoping to improve their health when everything else has failed",
      "Carol Seeger finally escaped her debilitating depression with an experimental treatment that placed electrodes in her brain and a pacemaker-like device in her chest. But when its batteries stopped working, insurance wouldn\u2019t pay to fix the problem and she sank back into a dangerous darkness.",
      "She worried for her life, asking herself: \u201cWhy am I putting myself through this?\u201d",
      "Seeger\u2019s predicament highlights a growing problem for hundreds of people with experimental neural implants, including those for depression, quadriplegia and other conditions. Although these patients take big risks to advance science, there's no guarantee that their devices will be maintained \u2014 particularly after they finish participating in clinical trials \u2014 and no mechanism requiring companies or insurers to do so.",
      "A research project led by Gabriel L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz, a Harvard University scientist, aimed to change that by creating partnerships between players in the burgeoning implant field to overcome barriers to device access and follow-up care.",
      "But the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health grants by the Trump administration this year left the project in limbo, dimming hope for Seeger and others like her who wonder what will happen to their health and progress.",
      "Unlike medications, implanted devices often require parts, maintenance, batteries and surgeries when changes are needed. Insurance typically covers such expenses for federally approved devices considered medically necessary, but not experimental ones.",
      "A procedure to replace a battery alone can cost more than $15,000 without insurance, L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz said.",
      "While companies stand to profit from research, \u201cthere\u2019s really nothing that helps ensure that device manufacturers have to provide any of these parts or cover any kind of maintenance,\u201d said L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz.",
      "Some companies also move on to newer versions of devices or abandon the research altogether, which can leave patients in an uncertain place.",
      "Medtronic, the company that made the deep brain stimulation, or DBS, technology Seeger used, said in a statement that every study is different and that the company puts patient safety first when considering care after studies end.",
      "People consider various possibilities when they join a clinical trial.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration requires the informed consent process to include a description of \u201creasonably foreseeable risks and discomforts to the participant,\u201d a spokesperson said. However, the FDA doesn\u2019t require trial plans to include procedures for long-term device follow-up and maintenance, although the spokesperson stated that the agency has requested those in the past.",
      "While some informed consent forms say devices will be removed at a study\u2019s end, L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz said removal is ethically problematic when a device is helping a patient. Plus, he said, some trial participants told him and his colleagues that they didn\u2019t remember everything discussed during the consent process, partly because they were so focused on getting better.",
      "Brandy Ellis, a 49-year-old in Boynton Beach, Florida, said she was desperate for healing when she joined a trial testing the same treatment Seeger got, which delivers an electrical current into the brain to treat severe depression. She was willing to sign whatever forms were necessary to get help after nothing else had worked.",
      "\u201cI was facing death,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it was most definitely consent at the barrel of a gun, which is true for a lot of people who are in a terminal condition.\u201d",
      "Ellis and Seeger, 64, both turned to DBS as a last resort after trying many approved medications and treatments.",

      "She\u2019s now on her third battery. She needed surgery to replace two single-use ones, and the one she has now is rechargeable. She\u2019s lucky her insurance has covered the procedures, she said, but she worries it may not in the future.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t count on any coverage because there\u2019s nothing that says even though I\u2019ve had this and it works, that it has to be covered under my commercial or any other insurance,\u201d said Ellis, who advocates for other former trial participants.",
      "Even if companies still make replacement parts for older devices, she added, \u201cavailability and accessibility are entirely different things,\u201d given most people can\u2019t afford continued care without insurance coverage.",
      "Seeger, whose device was implanted in 2012 at Emory, said she went without a working device for around four months when the insurance coverage her wife\u2019s job at Emory provided wouldn\u2019t pay for battery replacement surgery. Neither would Medicare, which generally only covers DBS for FDA-approved uses.",
      "With her research team at Emory advocating for her, Seeger ultimately got financial help from the hospital's indigent care program and paid a few thousand dollars out of pocket.",
      "She now has a rechargeable battery, and the device has been working well. But at any point, she said, that could change.",
      "L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz hoped his work would protect people like Seeger and Ellis.",
      "\u201cWe should do whatever we can as a society to be able to help them maintain their health,\u201d he said.",
      "L\u00e1zaro-Mu\u00f1oz's project received about $987,800 from the National Institute of Mental Health in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years and was already underway when he was notified of the NIH funding cut in May. He declined to answer questions about it.",
      "Ellis said any delay in addressing the thorny issues around experimental brain devices hurts patients.",
      "Planning at the beginning of a clinical trial about how to continue treatment and maintain devices, she said, would be much better than depending on the kindness of researchers and the whims of insurers.",
      "\u201cIf this turns off, I get sick again. Like, I\u2019m not cured,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a treatment that absolutely works, but only as long as I\u2019ve got a working device.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Archaeologists in central Israel are excavating one of the world's oldest known burial sites, dating back 100,000 years",
      "SHOHAM, Israel -- Archaeologists believe they have found one of the oldest burial sites in the world at a cave in Israel, where the well-preserved remains of early humans dating back some 100,000 years were carefully arranged in pits.",
      "The findings at Tinshemet Cave in central Israel, published in an academic journal earlier this year, build on previous discoveries in northern Israel and add to a growing understanding of the origins of human burial.",
      "Of particular interest to archaeologists are objects found beside the remains that may have been used during ceremonies to honor the dead and could shed light on how our ancient ancestors thought about spirituality and the afterlife.",
      "\u201cThis is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,\" said Yossi Zaidner, one of the directors of the Tinshemet excavation and a professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem. \"It\u2019s actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.\u201d",
      "Archaeologists working at Tinshemet since 2016 have discovered the remains of five early humans that date back to around 110,000 to 100,000 years ago, according to various technologies.",
      "The skeletons were discovered in pits and carefully arranged in a fetal position, which is known as a burial position, said Zaidner. Many were found with objects, such as basalt pebbles, animal remains or fragments of ochre, a reddish pigment made from iron-rich rocks.",
      "These objects, some sourced from hundreds of kilometers (miles) away, had no known practical use for daily life, so experts believe they were part of rituals meant to honor the dead.",
      "Tinshemet Cave is a dark slash in central Israel\u2019s rolling hills filled with squeaking fruit bats. Inside and around the cave is an unassuming stone mound which Zaidner calls \u201cone of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.\u201d",
      "The Paleolithic era, also known as the Stone Age because of the onset of stone tools, lasted from as early as 3.3 million years ago until around 10,000 years ago. Tinshemet Cave is from the Middle Paleolithic era, roughly between 250,000 to 30,000 years ago.",
      "Some of the Tinshemet researchers' core findings were published in March in Nature Human Behavior. A key discovery were the remains of five early humans, including two full skeletons and three isolated skulls with other bones and teeth. Also of note were more than 500 differently sized fragments of red and orange ochre, a pigment created by heating iron-rich stones to a certain temperature \u2014 evidence that early humans had the means to create decorative objects.",
      "\u201cHere we see a really complex set of behaviors, not related to just food and surviving,\u201d Zaidner said.",
      "Using hand chisels and delicate, pen-sized pneumatic drills that resemble dental tools, archaeologists will need many more years to excavate the site. The field work, which started in 2016, is usually done over the summer months. This year, a dozen archaeology undergraduate and graduate students fanned out across the site, painstakingly documenting and removing each fragment of tool, object or bone.",
      "At the entrance to the cave, the skull of one of the early humans is slowly emerging from the rock sediment; it will be years before it is fully excavated.",

      "Tinshemet is exceptionally important to archaeologists because the local climate preserved the bones, tools, and ornaments in good condition, unlike many other parts of the world where these items were lost to time, said Christian Tryon, a professor at the University of Connecticut and a research associate at the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The skeletons and objects were so well preserved because of ash from frequent fires, likely for rituals. This large amount of ash mixed with rainfall and Israel's acidic limestone, creating optimal conditions for perseveration. One skeleton was in such good condition archaeologists could see how the fingers were interwoven, hands clasped beneath the head.",
      "Tryon said the Tinshemet findings are bolstering earlier discoveries from two similar burial sites dating back to the same period in northern Israel \u2014 Skhul Cave and Qafzeh Cave. Skhul Cave was excavated almost 100 years ago, and Qafzeh Cave mostly around 50 years ago, when archaeological practices were more haphazard.",
      "\u201cThere were so many uncertainties with those sites, but this is confirming it\u2019s a pattern we know, and they\u2019re really nailing down the dates,\u201d Tryon said.",
      "Tinshemet has helped archaeologists conclude that burial practices started to become more widespread during this time, representing a shift in how early humans treated their dead.",
      "Some archaeologists believe intentional burials started earlier. In South Africa, the Homo naledi species \u2013 an ancient cousin of Homo sapiens \u2013 may have been intentionally placing their dead in caves as early as 200,000 years ago. But many archaeologists said the findings are controversial and there is not enough evidence to support the claim of intentional burials.",
      "In ancient times, Israel was a bridge between Neanderthals from Europe and Homo sapiens from Africa. Archaeologists have identified other subgroups of early humans in the area, and believe the groups interacted and may have interbred.",
      "Experts have been studying the two full skeletons brought from Tinshemet for years, but it\u2019s still unclear if they were Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, a hybrid population or another group altogether.",
      "The mix of subgroups created opportunities for different groups of early humans to exchange knowledge or express identity, said Zaidner. It\u2019s around this time that archaeologists first see examples of early jewelry or body painting, which could be ways early humans started outwardly belonging to a certain group, drawing boundaries between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and the co-director of the Tinshemet site, said the concept of cemeteries in prehistoric life is important because it symbolizes \u201ca kind of a territory.\u201d",
      "He said that same kind of claim over land where ancestors are buried still echoes in the region. \u201cIt\u2019s a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying \u2019this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on.\u201d",

      "But one of Trump\u2019s three AI executive orders signed Wednesday \u2014 the one \u201cpreventing woke AI in the federal government\u201d \u2014 marks the first time the U.S. government has explicitly tried to shape the ideological behavior of AI.",
      "Several leading providers of the AI language models targeted by the order \u2014 products like Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot \u2014 have so far been silent on Trump's anti-woke directive, which still faces a study period before it gets into official procurement rules.",
      "While the tech industry has largely welcomed Trump's broader AI plans, the anti-woke order forces the industry to leap into a culture war battle \u2014 or try their best to quietly avoid it.",
      "\u201cIt will have massive influence in the industry right now,\u201d especially as tech companies are already capitulating to other Trump administration directives, said civil rights advocate Alejandra Montoya-Boyer, senior director of The Leadership Conference\u2019s Center for Civil Rights and Technology.",
      "The move also pushes the tech industry to abandon years of work to combat the pervasive forms of racial and gender bias that studies and real-world examples have shown to be baked into AI systems.",
      "\u201cFirst off, there's no such thing as woke AI,\u201d Montoya-Boyer said. \u201cThere\u2019s AI technology that discriminates and then there\u2019s AI technology that actually works for all people.\u201d",
      "Molding the behaviors of AI large language models is challenging because of the way they\u2019re built and the inherent randomness of what they produce. They\u2019ve been trained on most of what\u2019s on the internet, reflecting the biases of all the people who\u2019ve posted commentary, edited a Wikipedia entry or shared images online.",
      "\u201cThis will be extremely difficult for tech companies to comply with,\u201d said former Biden administration official Jim Secreto, who was deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, an architect of many of President Joe Biden's AI industry initiatives. \u201cLarge language models reflect the data they\u2019re trained on, including all the contradictions and biases in human language.\u201d",
      "Tech workers also have a say in how they're designed, from the global workforce of annotators who check their responses to the Silicon Valley engineers who craft the instructions for how they interact with people.",
      "Trump's order targets those \u201ctop-down\u201d efforts at tech companies to incorporate what it calls the \u201cdestructive\u201d ideology of diversity, equity and inclusion into AI models, including \u201cconcepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism.\u201d",
      "The directive has invited comparison to China's heavier-handed efforts to ensure that generative AI tools reflect the core values of the ruling Communist Party. Secreto said the order resembles China\u2019s playbook in \u201cusing the power of the state to stamp out what it sees as disfavored viewpoints.\"",
      "The method is different, with China relying on direct regulation by auditing AI models, approving them before they are deployed and requiring them to filter out banned content such as the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989.",
      "Trump's order doesn't call for any such filters, relying on tech companies to instead show that their technology is ideologically neutral by disclosing some of the internal policies that guide the chatbots.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is taking a softer but still coercive route by using federal contracts as leverage,\u201d Secreto said. \u201cThat creates strong pressure for companies to self-censor in order to stay in the government\u2019s good graces and keep the money flowing.\u201d",
      "The order's call for \u201ctruth-seeking\u201d AI echoes the language of the president's one-time ally and adviser Elon Musk, who has made it the mission of the Grok chatbot made by his company xAI.",

      "Teenagers are turning to AI for advice, guidance and conversation",
      "As artificial intelligence technology becomes part of daily life, adolescents are turning to chatbots for advice, guidance and conversation. The appeal is clear: Chatbots are patient, never judgmental, supportive and always available.",
      "That worries experts who say the booming AI industry is largely unregulated and that many parents have no idea about how their kids are using AI tools or the extent of personal information they are sharing with chatbots.",
      "New research shows more than 70% of American teenagers have used AI companions and more than half converse with them regularly. The study by Common Sense Media focused on \u201cAI companions,\u201d like Character. AI, Nomi and Replika, which it defines as \u201cdigital friends or characters you can text or talk with whenever you want,\u201d versus AI assistants or tools like ChatGPT, though it notes they can be used the same way.",
      "It\u2019s important that parents understand the technology. Experts suggest some things parents can do to help protect their kids:",
      "\u2014 Start a conversation, without judgment, says Michael Robb, head researcher at Common Sense Media. Approach your teen with curiosity and basic questions: \u201cHave you heard of AI companions?\u201d \u201cDo you use apps that talk to you like a friend?\u201d Listen and understand what appeals to your teen before being dismissive or saying you\u2019re worried about it.",
      "\u2014 Help teens recognize that AI companions are programmed to be agreeable and validating. Explain that\u2019s not how real relationships work and that real friends with their own points of view can help navigate difficult situations in ways that AI companions cannot.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that's really concerning is not only what's happening on screen but how much time it\u2019s taking kids away from relationships in real life,\u201d says Mitch Prinstein, chief of psychology at the American Psychological Association. \u201cWe need to teach kids that this is a form of entertainment. It's not real, and it's really important they distinguish it from reality and should not have it replace relationships in your actual life.\u201d",
      "The APA recently put out a health advisory on AI and adolescent well-being, and tips for parents.",

      "\u201cIf your teen is preferring AI interactions over real relationships or spending hours talking to AI companions, or showing that they are becoming emotionally distressed when separated from them \u2014 those are patterns that suggest AI companions might be replacing rather than complementing human connection,\u201d Robb says.",
      "\u2014 Parents can set rules about AI use, just like they do for screen time and social media. Have discussions about when and how AI tools can and cannot be used. Many AI companions are designed for adult use and can mimic romantic, intimate and role-playing scenarios.",

      "KYOTO, Japan -- Nishijinori, the intricate weaving technique for kimonos that dates back more than a thousand years in Japan\u2019s ancient capital of Kyoto, is getting a high-tech collaborator: artificial intelligence.",
      "The revered colorful weaving style associated with \u201cThe Tale of Genji\u201d of the 11th-century Heian era, has gone through its share of ups and downs. But its survival is more perilous than ever today, as demand for kimonos nose-dives among Japanese grappling with modernization.",
      "Hironori Fukuoka, the fourth-generation successor to his Nishijinori business, is determined to keep alive the art he\u2019s inherited, even if that means turning to AI.",
      "\u201cI want to leave to legacy what my father has left for me,\u201d he said in his rickety shop in the Nishijin district of Kyoto, a city with statue-filled temples and sculpted gardens that never seems to change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been pondering how the art of Nishijinori can stay relevant to the needs of today,\u201d said Fukuoka.",

      "Giant looms clatter at his shop, called Fukuoka Weaving. The patterns on the gorgeous fabric, slowly turning out from the loom, are repetitive and geometric, which makes it conducive to translating into digital data. Deciding which hand-dyed color thread goes where to make the patterns is much like the on-or-off digital signals of a computer.",
      "Such similarity is what Fukuoka focuses on in exploring how AI might work for Nishijinori, with the help of Sony Computer Science Laboratories, an independent research arm of electronics and entertainment company Sony Corp.",
      "AI only makes suggestions for the designs and doesn\u2019t do any of the actual production work. But that doesn\u2019t bother Fukuoka or the researchers.",
      "\u201cOur research stems from the idea that human life gets truly enriched only if it has both what\u2019s newly innovated and what never changes,\u201d said Jun Rekimoto, chief science officer at Sony CSL, which is also studying how AI can be used to document and relay the moves of a traditional Japanese tea ceremony.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t believe AI can do everything. Nishijinori is a massive, complicated industry and so it starts with figuring out where AI can help out,\u201d said Rekimoto, also a professor at the University of Tokyo.",
      "What has come of it is a startling but logical turn in thinking, fitting of the art adorning kimonos worn by Japan's imperial family.",
      "The AI was fed various Nishijinori patterns that already existed and instructed to come up with its own suggestions. One was a bold pattern of black and orange that seemed to evoke a tropical motif.",
      "To Fukuoka, some of AI\u2019s ideas are interesting but simply off. The difference between AI and the human effort is that the former can come up with multiple suggestions in a matter of seconds.",

But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",

But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",

Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study\u2019s lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",

      "Three men and one woman were killed in Monday night's shooting.",
      "Police have identified the man who entered a Midtown Manhattan office building wearing body armor and opened fire killing four people with a high-powered rifle, as Shane Devon Tamura.",
      "The 27-year-old recently lived in Las Vegas, where he was issued a concealed firearms permit by the Las Vegas Police Department. He was previously issued a work card by the Nevada Private Investigators Licensing Board, which has since expired, according to records reviewed by ABC News. His last known address was in a gated community in Las Vegas.",
      "Several squad cars from Las Vegas Metro Police have convened at entrances to a gated neighborhood where Tamura was believed to have lived.",
      "He completed high school in the Los Angeles area, where he was a competitive football player, according to a school official who spoke with ABC News. Caleb Clarke, a former classmate of Tamura at Santa Clarita High School, described him as a \"goofball\" and did not recall him having any mental health issues. Tamura played as a running back with Grenada Hills Charter for a portion of his high school career.",
      "New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said Tamura had a \"documented mental health history.\" He recently drove from Las Vegas to New York, and officers found additional ammunition, a revolver, a backpack, and medication inside his vehicle.",

      "HONOLULU -- Lawmakers on Maui passed legislation Thursday aimed at eliminating a large percentage of the Hawaiian island's vacation rentals to address a housing shortage exacerbated by the wildfire that destroyed most of Lahaina two years ago.",
      "It's the latest action by a top global tourist destination to push back against the infiltration of vacationers into residential neighborhoods and tourism overwhelming their communities. In May, Spain ordered Airbnb to block more than 65,000 holiday listings on its platform for having violated rules. Last month, thousands of protesters in European cities like Barcelona and Venice, Italy, marched against the ills of overtourism.",
      "The Maui County Council's housing committee voted 6-3 to pass the bill, which would close a loophole that has allowed owners of condos in apartment zones to rent their units for days or weeks at a time instead of a minimum of 180 days. The mandate would take effect in the West Maui district that includes Lahaina in 2028. The rest of the county would have until 2030 to comply.",

      "The report also predicted one-quarter of Maui County\u2019s visitor accommodations would vanish and visitor spending would sink 15%. It estimated gross domestic product would contract by 4%.",
      "The mayor said such economic analysis failed to tell a full story, noting families are torn apart when high housing costs drive out relatives and that cultural knowledge disappears when generations leave Maui.",
      "The mayor told the council the bill was one part of a broader housing strategy that would include building new housing, investing in infrastructure and stopping illegally operated vacation rentals. He said there were limits to how much new housing could be built because of constraints on water supplies and sewer infrastructure.",
      "Tourism would continue on Maui but must do so in a way \u201cthat doesn't hollow out our neighborhoods,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "The mayor's staff told council members that visitor spending would decline with the measure but most of the drop would be on lodging. Because 94% of those who own vacation rentals in apartment zones don't live on Maui, they said much of this income already flows off-island. They predicted the county budget could withstand an estimated $61 million decline in annual tax revenue resulting from the measure.",

      "A federal judge on Monday ruled Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide must continue to be reimbursed for Medicaid funding as the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider fights President Donald Trump\u2019s administration over efforts to defund the organization in his signature tax legislation.",
      "The new order replaces a previous edict handed down by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston last week. Talwani initially granted a preliminary injunction specifically blocking the government from cutting Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood members that didn\u2019t provide abortion care or didn\u2019t meet a threshold of at least $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in a given year.",
      "\u201cPatients are likely to suffer adverse health consequences where care is disrupted or unavailable,\u201d Talwani wrote in her Monday order. \u201cIn particular, restricting Members\u2019 ability to provide healthcare services threatens an increase in unintended pregnancies and attendant complications because of reduced access to effective contraceptives, and an increase in undiagnosed and untreated STIs.\u201d",
      "A provision in Trump\u2019s tax bill instructed the federal government to end Medicaid payments for one year to abortion providers that received more than $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023, even to those like Planned Parenthood that also offer medical services like contraception, pregnancy tests and STD testing.",
      "Although Planned Parenthood is not specifically named in the statute, which went into effect July 4, the organization\u2019s leaders say it was meant to affect their nearly 600 centers in 48 states. However, a major medical provider in Maine and likely others have also been hit.",
      "In her Monday order, Talwani said that the court was \u201cnot enjoining the federal government from regulating abortion and is not directing the federal government to fund elective abortions or any healthcare service not otherwise eligible for Medicaid coverage.\u201d Instead, Talwani said that her decision would block the federal government from excluding groups like Planned Parenthood from Medicaid reimbursements when they have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success in their legal challenge.",
      "In its lawsuit, Planned Parenthood had argued that they would be at risk of closing nearly 200 clinics in 24 states if they are cut off from Medicaid funds. They estimated this would result in more than 1 million patients losing care.",

      "DENVER -- Lawyers are set to deliver closing arguments Tuesday in the trial of a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife by gradually poisoning her.",
      "James Craig is charged with murder in the death of Angela Craig in suburban Denver in 2023. He is also accused of trying to fabricate evidence in the case to make it look like she killed herself and of asking a fellow jail inmate to kill the detective who led the investigation into his wife's death.",
      "Angela Craig, who had six children with James Craig, died in 2023 during her third trip to the hospital in a little over a week. Toxicology tests later determined the 43-year-old died of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient found in over-the-counter eye drops.",
      "Police previously said James Craig purchased a variety of poisons before his wife's death and put some in the protein shakes he made for her. During the trial, prosecutors alleged that he also gave her a fatal dose of cyanide as she lay in her hospital bed on March 15, 2023, as doctors tried to figure out what was ailing her. She was declared brain dead soon afterward.",
      "James Craig didn't testify and his lawyers didn't present any witnesses \u2014 and it wasn't required. Instead, in opening statements and in their questioning of prosecution witnesses, Craig's lawyers seemed to suggest that Angela Craig may have taken her own life and faulted police for focusing solely on James Craig as a suspect.",
      "In notes that police found on James Craig's phone, the dentist said Angela Craig asked him to help kill her with poison when he sought a divorce after having affairs. In the document, which was labeled \u201ctimeline,\u201d Craig said he eventually agreed to purchase and prepare poisons for her to take but not administer them. Craig said that he put cyanide in some of the antibiotic capsules she had been taking and also prepared a syringe containing cyanide.",
      "According to that timeline, Craig wrote that just before she had to go to the hospital on March 15, 2023, she must have ingested a mixture containing tetrahydrozoline, the eye drop ingredient, because she became lethargic and weak. Then, he wrote, she took the antibiotic laced with cyanide that he prepared for her.",

      "Honolulu is suing major fossil fuel companies, including ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron, over climate change impacts",
      "HONOLULU -- Honolulu is not alone in its effort to sue fossil fuel companies to hold them accountable for climate change harms, but the city's lawsuit is further along than similar litigation across the country. A hearing on Tuesday will indicate how these fights play out in court.",
      "In 2020, Hawaii's capital city sued major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, Shell and Chevron, arguing they knew for nearly half a century that fossil fuel products create greenhouse gas pollution that warms the planet and changes the climate. The companies have also profited from the consumption of oil, coal and natural gas while deceiving the public about the role of their products in causing a global climate crisis, the lawsuit says.",
      "Honolulu's lawsuit blames the companies for the sea level rise around the island of Oahu's world-famous coastline. It also warns that hurricanes, heatwaves and other extreme weather will be more frequent, along with ocean warming that will reduce fish stocks and kill coral reefs that tourists love to snorkel over.",
      "The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of damages. Attorneys and media representatives for most of the companies didn't immediately respond to emails and phone messages from The Associated Press seeking comment on the lawsuit.",
      "ConocoPhillips and Phillips 66 representatives sent emails saying they don't comment on pending litigation.",
      "A hearing is scheduled in state court on Tuesday for a defense motion that argues the lawsuit should be dismissed because the state's two-year statute of limitations expired. Honolulu's claims are based on allegations that have been publicly known for decades, the defense motion for summary judgment says.",
      "\u201cThe issue of climate change and how to tackle it has long been part of public discussion and ongoing scientific research and debate for many decades,\u201d a Shell spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThere is a vast public record of media articles, scientific journals and government reports for well over 50 years that make this clear. The suggestion that the plaintiffs were somehow unaware of climate change is simply not credible.\u201d",
      "While the case is still far from trial, it's much closer than some 30 similar lawsuits nationwide brought by other states, cities and counties. Lawyer arguments and the judge's questions on Tuesday will give a sense of how both sides will present their cases, said Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.",
      "\u201cThe first trial in any of these cases will be very significant,\" he said. \u201cIt will get a large amount of nationwide or even global attention because the oil companies have not yet had to take the stand and defend themselves in a trial.\u201d",

      "The state of Hawaii has also filed a similar suit, despite the U.S. Department of Justice in May suing Hawaii and Michigan over their plans for legal action against fossil fuel companies, claiming their climate actions conflict with federal authority and President Donald Trump's energy dominance agenda.",
      "Hawaii's attorney general's office filed a motion last week seeking to stop the Department of Justice's federal lawsuit: \u201cAllowing this case to proceed would give the United States license to wield the federal courts as a weapon against any litigation between nonfederal parties that an incumbent presidential administration dislikes.\"",
      "Honolulu's lawsuit has drawn the attention of Naomi Oreskes, a prominent Harvard University science history professor, who submitted a declaration in a motion opposing the defendants' motion for summary judgment.",
      "Oreskes drew parallels between the fossil fuel and tobacco industries. \u201cThe fossil fuel industry and its allies and surrogates created an organized campaign to foster and sustain doubt about anthropogenic global warming and prevent meaningful action,\" she wrote. \"They did this by influencing consumers and the general public.\u201d",
      "Soon before a lawsuit by a group of youths against Hawaii's transportation department was scheduled to go to trial, both sides settled the case last year, agreeing on an ambitious requirement to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions across all transportation modes no later than 2045.",

      "The trial of James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife Angela Craig by gradually poisoining her, is winding down",
      "DENVER -- DENVER (AP) \u2014 The trial of James Craig, a Colorado dentist accused of killing his wife Angela Craig by gradually poisoning her, is wrapping up. Lawyers are set to deliver closing arguments Tuesday before jurors begin deliberations.",
      "Jurors have heard from some of Angela Craig's relatives and also women James Craig had been having affairs with, all called by prosecutors. James Craig didn\u2019t testify and his lawyers didn\u2019t present any witnesses, which they\u2019re not required to.",
      "Angela Craig, 43, was a mother of six children who friends and family say was devoted to her family. She was the youngest of 10 siblings herself and a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Described as organized and dependable, she had taken over her mother\u2019s role as the genealogist for her birth family, an important role in their faith. Her older brother Mark Pray said she had been \u201chappy and positive\u201d since she was a child. But her sister Toni Kofoed testified that her sister had confided in her about struggles she was having in her marriage. However, pushing back against defense suggestions that her sister may have killed herself, Kofoed said her sister had a \u201cbroken heart\u201d but not a \u201cbroken mind.\u201d",
      "Angela Craig died in 2023 during her third trip to the hospital in a little over a week. Toxicology tests later determined she died of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient found in over-the-counter eye drops. Early on, James Craig had purchased a variety of poisons before his wife's death and had put some in the protein shakes he made for her, according to police. During the trial, prosecutors alleged that he also gave her a dose of cyanide as she lay in her hospital bed on March 15, 2023, as doctors tried to figure out what was ailing her. She was declared brain dead soon afterward and never recovered.",
      "In a notes file later found on James Craig\u2019s phone by police, he said Angela Craig had asked him to help kill her with poison when he asked for a divorce after having affairs. In the document, which was labeled \u201ctimeline,\u201d Craig said that he had eventually agreed to purchase and prepare poisons for her to take, but not administer them. Craig said that he had put cyanide in some of the antibiotic capsules she had been taking and also prepared a syringe containing cyanide.",
      "According to his timeline, Craig wrote that just before she had to go to the hospital on March 15, 2023, she must have ingested a mixture containing the tetrahydrozoline, the eye drop ingredient, because she became lethargic and weak, before then taking the antibiotic laced with cyanide that he said he prepared for her. Mark Pray, who was visiting to help the Craig family because of his sister's mysterious illness, testified that he gave Angela Craig the capsules after being instructed to do so by James Craig, who was not at home. Pray said his sister bent over and couldn't hold herself up after taking the medicine. He and his wife then took her to the hospital.",

That\u2019s when he noticed me with the grocery cart ... I just went as hard as I could and just got him on his ankles with the grocery cart from behind.\u201d",
      "Kolakowski, a 39-year-old disabled veteran, was quickly joined by another man with a shopping cart, stopping the man later identified by authorities as Gille. A third man pointed a gun toward the man, repeatedly demanding he drop the knife.",
      "He eventually put the knife down and Kolakowski said he jumped on the man, restraining him until police quickly arrived.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t hesitate at all,\u201d said Kolakowski, speaking from his home in nearby Kent City. Though he was wary of being stabbed himself, he said, \u201cI just kept going.\u201d",

      "Faith leaders across the U.S. are hoping a bipartisan bill, recently introduced in the U.S. Senate and House, might finally bring resolution to an immigration issue that has been hindering their service to their communities for more than two years.",
      "In March 2023, the Biden administration made a sudden change in how the government processes green cards in the category that includes both abused minors and religious workers. It created new backlogs that threaten the ability of thousands of pastors, nuns, imams, cantors and others to remain in the United States.",
      "The bill only tackles one small part of the issue, which sponsoring lawmakers hope will increase its chances of passing even as immigration remains one of the most polarizing issues in the country.",
      "Faith leaders say even a narrow fix will be enough to prevent damaging losses to congregations and to start planning for the future again.",
      "\u201cUnless there is a change to current practice, our community is slowly being strangled,\u201d said the Rev. Aaron Wessman, vicar general and director of formation for the Glenmary Home Missioners, a small Catholic order ministering in rural America.",
      "\u201cI will weep with joy if this legislation passes,\" he said. \"It means the world for our members who are living in the middle of uncertainty and for the people they\u2019ll be able to help.\u201d",
      "Two thirds of Glenmary\u2019s priests and brothers under 50 years old are foreign-born \u2014 mostly from Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria and Uganda \u2014 and they are affected by the current immigration snag, Wessman added.",
      "So are thousands of others who serve the variety of faiths present in the United States, from Islam to Hinduism to evangelical Christianity, providing both pastoral care and social services.",
      "No exact numbers exist, but it is estimated that there are thousands of religious workers who are now backlogged in the green card system and/or haven\u2019t been able to apply yet.",
      "Congregations bring to the United States religious workers under temporary visas called R-1, which allow them to work for up to five years. That used to be enough time for the congregations to petition for green cards under a special category called EB-4, which would allow the clergy to become permanent residents.",
      "Congress sets a quota of green cards available per year divided in categories, almost all based on types of employment or family relationships to U.S. citizens. In most categories, the demand exceeds the annual quota.",
      "Citizens of countries with especially high demand get put in separate, often longer \u201clines\u201d \u2014 for several years, the most backlogged category has been that of married Mexican children of U.S. citizens, where only applications filed more than 24 years ago are being processed.",
      "Also in a separate line were migrant children with \u201cSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status\u201d \u2014 neglected or abused minors \u2014 from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Hundreds of thousands sought humanitarian green cards or asylum after illegally crossing into the U.S. since the mid-2010s, though the Trump administration recently cracked down on the program.",
      "In March 2023, the State Department suddenly started adding the minors to the general green card queue with the clergy. That has created such a bottleneck that in April, only halfway through the current fiscal year, those green cards became unavailable.",
      "And when they will become available in the new fiscal year starting in October, they are likely to be stuck in the six-year backlog they faced earlier this year \u2014 meaning religious workers with a pending application won\u2019t get their green cards before their five-year visas expire and they must leave the country.",
      "In a report released Thursday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services blamed the EB-4 backlogs on the surge in applications by minors from Central America, and said the agency found widespread fraud in that program.",

      "Last summer, the Diocese of Paterson \u2014 serving 400,000 Catholics and 107 parishes in three New Jersey counties \u2014 and five of its affected priests sued the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.",

The government\u2019s initial response was that the Department of State was correct in making that change, according to court documents.",
      "Expecting some action on the legislative front, the parties agreed to stay the lawsuit, said Raymond Lahoud, the diocese\u2019s attorney.",
      "But because the bills weren\u2019t included in the nearly-900-page sprawling legislation that Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this month, the lawsuit is moving forward, Lahoud said.",

      "Judge Justin Beresky abruptly interrupted, saying: \u201cActually, they do.\u201d",
      "It was a moment that further highlighted the tension between Lori Vallow Daybell, who represented herself in two murder conspiracy cases in Arizona, and Beresky, who pulled no punches when the time came for him to address the court.",
      "Beresky said Vallow Daybell was not truthful when she claimed she was prevented from telling her side of the story and was unable to get a fair trial. The media attention she craved, he said, will fade into obscurity now that her trials are over.",
      "\u201cThe amount of contemplation, calculation, planning and manipulation that went into these crimes is unparalleled in my career,\u201d said Beresky, who has been a Maricopa County Superior Court judge since 2017 and has presided over other high-profile cases.",
      "Friday\u2019s sentencing ended the legal saga of Vallow Daybell, 51, who will likely spend no time in an Arizona prison because she already was serving three life sentences in Idaho for killing her two youngest children and conspiring to kill a romantic rival.",
      "In Arizona she was convicted of conspiring to kill her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, and her niece\u2019s ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux. Charles Vallow was fatally shot, while Boudreaux survived.",
      "Vallow Daybell maintained that she did nothing wrong and said the string of deaths were simply tragedies.",
      "She turned to her own religious beliefs in saying she believes she is among servants who Jesus is sending into prison to become warriors and who, ultimately, will be released to serve him.",
      "Beresky implied that she got the meaning wrong when she referenced a verse about prisoners going free.",
      "\u201cThat is a verse about people that accept Jesus can be in prison and they will go free when they die and go to heaven, but it will take an act of God for you to go free,\u201d the judge said. \u201cIn short, you should never be released from prison.\u201d",
      "Vallow Daybell's trials in Phoenix were infused with her religious beliefs, including that people in her life were possessed by evil spirits. She routinely sparred with Beresky, occasionally leaning over to consult with her advisory counsel.",

She insisted on exercising her speedy trial rights and rejected the judge\u2019s offer for later dates, yet complained about not having enough time to prepare. She also tried to get Beresky removed from the case, arguing that he was biased against her.",

The state has 38 seats in the House. Republicans now hold 25 and Democrats 12, with one seat vacant after the death of a Democrat.",

      "Every decade, the Census Bureau collects population data used to divide the 435 House seats among the 50 states based on the updated head count.",
      "It's a process known as reapportionment. States that grew relative to others might gain a seat at the expense of those whose populations stagnated or declined.",
      "States use their own procedures to draw lines for the assigned number of districts. The smallest states receive just one representative, which means the entire state is a single congressional district.",
      "Some state constitutions require independent commissions to devise the political boundaries or to advise the legislature. When legislatures take the lead, lawmakers can risk drawing lines that end up challenged in court, usually for violating the Voting Rights Act. Mapmakers can get another chance to resubmit new maps.

    "published": "Sun, 27 Jul 2025 09:53:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The singer's love for the Great American Songbook goes far beyond standards written by Gershwin or Porter.",
    "story": [
      "For most of his 50-year career, Michael Feinstein has shown his love for the great American songs by performing them. \"There was something I connected to with the harmonic invention of the songs, the melodic ideas,\" he said. \"They express fundamental emotions in a very eloquent way that people can still relate to.\"",
      "He got his start early, as a little boy In Columbus, Ohio: \"When I was five, my father said, 'Let's get a piano.' I sat down and started playing 'Do-Re-Mi' from 'The Sound of Music' with both hands. My mother came in from the kitchen and said, 'Who taught you that?' And I said, 'Nobody!' And she sent me to my room for lying!\"",
      "He was playing by ear at five years old. Of his childhood he said, \"I always felt weird. I always felt different than everybody else. I was a lonely kid. I didn't have many friends. The first classical record I bought was the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto, while my friends were all listening to Elton John and Carole King and Carly Simon.\"",
      "But his \"unpopular\" hobby soon made him a popular entertainer. For 12 years, he played in piano bars, five or six hours a night. \"It was mainly gay bars,\" he said, \"'cause those are the places where I could play show tunes without anybody complaining about it.\"",
      "He didn't go to college, but he did get an amazing education. For example, \"I learned that I had to program what I was doing as if I was programming a show, with an emotional arc. I learned what to say between the songs that I learned \u2013 patter and jokes and shtick and things that keep people engaged.\"",
      "Feinstein moved to L.A. when he was 20, where he met one of his idols: 80-year-old Ira Gershwin, George Gershwin's lyric-writing brother. Ira was so impressed by the young man's encyclopedic knowledge of Gershwin material that he gave him a job. \"I was only supposed to be there for a couple of weeks to catalog the phonograph records,\" Feinstein said. \"But I ended up spending six years as Ira's musical companion, an amanuensis, which is a nice word for stooge! It was an incredible time, the most exciting time in my life.\"",
      "In 1986, Feinstein got the invitation that changed his life: to perform in the Oak Room at New York's Algonquin Hotel. \"And from that, everything started popping,\" he said.",
      "At 29 years old, Feinstein's career was launched. Decades of glory days lay ahead \u2013 on stage, on PBS, on his 86 albums, and in his lifelong friendship with Liza Minnelli. (He's collaborating with her on her new memoir.) But he didn't just want to sing the Great American Songs; he also wanted to collect them.",
      "He's amassed a vast collection of memorabilia, recordings and scores, such as the first printing of \"Rhapsody in Blue.\"",
      "In recent years Feinstein has become increasingly dedicated to passing his love of the great songs to the next generation. He said, \"I'm carrying the weight of the responsibility to present these songs in a way that hopefully will appeal to them. Every time these songs are introduced to a younger person, it's like planting a seed, because it becomes part of them, and it goes on.\"",
      "In that spirit, Feinstein has established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Carmel, Indiana. There's a museum of songwriter artifacts \u2026 a performing arts center \u2026 and a weeklong Songbook Academy, in which 40 students from around the U.S. are selected to intensively learn about interpreting this music. \"And it's right alongside Taylor Swift or Adele or whoever else they're listening to,\" he said.",
      "For Feinstein the Great American Songbook isn't just music from before 1950: \"I think that Carole King and Billy Joel and Neil Sedaka and Elton John, they're all part of the American Songbook,\" he said. \"It's not just the 1910s and the '20s and the '30s; it is evolving.\"",
      "Michael Feinstein still performs live all over the country, including a concert of Tony Bennett classics (which you can watch on the streaming service Carnegie Hall+ on August 3) \u2013 because maybe the best way of all to keep the classics alive is to keep singing them.",

    "story": [
      "She may be Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, but you're just as likely to find her living in Paris as you might in London. \"My blood is English, but my culture is French,\" she said.",
      "There is a duality about her. She can be as heartwarming in English (\"Darkest Hour\") as she can be heartwrenching in French (\"I've Loved You So Long\"). Many of her foreign films have been showcased at the Cine Lumiere, a French art house in London. \"A little slice of Paris,\" she said.",
      "It's convenient, now that she's back in London, playing the deputy director of MI5 in the Apple TV+ series \"Slow Horses.\"",
      "A chilly, stiff upper-lip has often been a calling card for Thomas \u2013 too stiff, she admits, early on: \"I think it was Sydney Pollock \u2013 or it might have been Robert Redford, take your pick,\" she laughed. \"One of them said to me, 'You know, you have to be generous. Forget what you're trying to defend. Forget trying to hide. Be more generous.' And I'm not sure I really understood what he meant by that. He just planted a seed, and then I was able to kind of unzip a bit more.\"",
      "And she about to unzip even more, creatively digging into something intensely personal in her past. She said, \"When I was five, my father was killed, and my mother remarried. And tragically, he was killed five years later. And I know that a lot of the time when I was a younger woman, I had this feeling of something missing, this piece of my puzzle missing having grown up with only one parent.\"",
      "Both had been pilots in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm; both were lost in remarkably similar training accidents; and both left a hole that had her climbing out into her imagination. When she was a little girl she wrote and illustrated stories: \"A mommy and a daddy and two children, just doing ordinary things, like going away on holiday and things like that\" \u2013 a family experience she never knew.",
      "The memories of her dad were incomplete, fuzzy, like sketches she played out in her head. But those images became the seeds for what grew into a screenplay, and then came to life as the first movie she's ever directed: \"My Mother's Wedding.\"",
      "It garnered an all-star cast: Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham play Thomas' daughters who are each struggling in different ways  with the loss of a father or stepfather, just as their mother prepares to marry again.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"My Mother's Wedding\" click on the video player below:",
      "Thomas has already done movie weddings, of course, as in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" Early on, she had a sarcastic confidence about her. She didn't have the most lines in that 1994 film, but in brevity she was brilliant:",
      "That demeanor might have been a surprise to those who knew her when she was bouncing around Royal Naval bases, a bit of a wallflower as a child, even into adulthood. \"I was excruciatingly shy,\" she said. \"I don't know when it changed, to be honest.\"",
      "She's hardly shy anymore, if her character in \"Fleabag\" is any indication. Perhaps it's fitting she was discovered by another admittedly shy success story, Prince. You'd think that would make her a pretty cool mom (she has three children with her first husband), but it turns out \u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I hadn't watched it with them, but as I was leaving my teenage children alone one evening, and they were having pizza and a friend 'round, I said, 'Watch \"Under the Cherry Moon,\" it's on the telly! Come on, it'll be fun!' And when I got back, they weren't actually very polite about it.\"",
      "She has more than made up for it, later starring opposite Robert Redford (\"The Horse Whisperer\"), Harrison Ford (\"Random Hearts\"), and Tom Cruise (\"Mission: Impossible\").",
      "\"I'm so proud to be in 'Mission: Impossible,' I cannot even get over it!\" she said. \"I'm in this thing, which is this enormous monster, and you know, these kids, they have no idea about 'Gosford Park.' They have no idea about 'Four Weddings,' but they've all seen 'Mission: Impossible'! And they have no idea I speak French or do all these other kind of slightly murkier films in France, you know?\"",
      "And then, of course, there was \"The English Patient,\" which earned her an Academy Award nomination for best actress. \"It's quite moving actually, when you see yourself at sort of 30 acting your socks off,\" she said.",
      "Another place she acted her socks off is at the Royal Court Theatre, where she won an Olivier Award for her performance in \"The Seagull,\" a role she later took to Broadway. \"New York audiences, when they are enjoying themselves, I mean it's electric \u2013 you can really, really feel it,\" she said.",
      "And London audiences? \"We are much more kind of passive, perhaps. Reserved. Of course we are!\" she laughed.",
      "But even while talking at the Royal Court, she found herself thinking about her film. As intimate as the stage may be, for her, \"My Mother's Wedding\" is more so. \"I love working on stage, as you can probably tell. I really, really love it. But the joy and satisfaction and exhaustion that comes from filmmaking when you are being a director, that is not far off. Pretty good. It's just extraordinary.\"",
      "At 65, and now a grandmother, she's working as hard as ever, not taking a lot of time to smell the roses per se, but she'll surely stop for someone who has a kind word or two: \"A lady came up to me the other day and said, 'I know you hate this, but I just wanted to say...' \u00a0and I said, 'I don't hate this at all!

    "story": [
      "Louise Nevelson's artwork looks right at home at the Whitney Museum of American Art, mingling with the skyscrapers of Manhattan. She found inspiration in the city as early as the 1920s, yet it would take the art world decades to recognize her and her iconic sculptures.",
      "\"She was given her first respective at the Whitney in 1967,\" said Maria Nevelson, the artist's granddaughter, who runs the Louise Nevelson Foundation. \"I was seven years old. And there was a line of people all the way around the block, up to the front door. I really did get chills. It was the first time I responded to artwork in general, and to my grandmother's artwork.\"",
      "Nearly six decades later, the Whitney is holding a new Nevelson exhibition, which is open until August 10.",
      "Asked what Louise was like as a grandmother, Maria laughed: \"Oh, she was intimidating and unconventional. What comes to mind first is her atmospheric dressing. Anything could have been pulled into this assemblage and this layering of rich brocades and silks.\"",
      "That fancy wardrobe didn't stop Nevelson from getting her hands dirty: \"She'd dumpster dive, she'd get into the garbage can, she'd pull out filthy pieces of wood, and we'd have to take 'em home,\" said Maria. \"I would say the streets of New York weren't paved with gold for her; it was paved with garbage. And she loved it!\"",
      "Nevelson's attraction to wood may have grown from her family tree \u2013 her family owned lumber yards in present-day Ukraine, where she was born in 1899. Louise was a young girl who spoke no English when her father decided to move the family to Rockland, Maine.",
      "\"It was a bustling seaport town,\" said Maria. \"They got off the train and, she said, rednecks threw mud at them. And she said, 'I knew I was a Jew, I knew I was different.' She was about five, six years old then. That's her greeting to America.\"",
      "Undaunted, Nevelson learned English, and at age nine, announced she was going to be a sculptor.",
      "\"She knew always what she wanted to be and do, and she pursued it fiercely,\" said Brooke Minto, executive director and CEO of the Columbus Museum of Art, where Nevelson's work is also currently on display. \"It was a decade's long journey, and she just kept at it.\"",
      "Nevelson would choose a monochromatic palette to unify her materials. Minto said, \"She really understood that she could create an all-over, immersive experience in her sculpture by pairing them down to a single color. It's this wonderful accumulation of very simple and humble objects into something that's quite monumental and immediately historical.\"",
      "According to Maria Nevelson, Louise did her best work when she was in her 70s and 80s, \"right up to when she passed away at 88.\"",
      "In 1979, Charles Osgood, of \"Sunday Morning,\" spoke to Louise when she was 79 years old and, arguably, at the height of her career. The artist remarked, \"You see, dear, if you are doing your creative work, you don't have age or time as such, and consequently you're not caught in it. So, you go on.\"",

    "summary": "In the late 1940s, the work of the House Un-American Activities Committee eventually led to a Hollywood blacklist, now the focus of an exhibit at the New York Historical Society.",
    "story": [
      "New York \u2014 The central question in 1947, as the House Un-American Activities Committee investigated alleged Communist influence in Hollywood, was: \"Are you a member of the Communist Party?\"",
      "Chaired by Republican Rep. John Parnell Thomas of New Jersey, the committee eventually led to a Hollywood blacklist, now the focus of a new exhibit at the New York Historical Society.",
      "\"The exhibit really tells the story of the Hollywood Ten,\" Louise Mirrer, president of the New York Historical Society, told CBS News, of a group of 10 Hollywood writers and directors. \"And the charge was for the Hollywood Ten, that they were making movies that espoused the Communist point of view.\"",
      "The Hollywood Ten refused to answer the committee's questions. They were held in contempt of Congress, each sentenced from anywhere between six months to a year in prison, and blacklisted by studio executives.",
      "\"I think it had an enormous effect,\" Anne Lessy, assistant curator of history exhibitions for the historical society, told CBS News of the impact of the blacklist. \"If you wanted to be a part of the film industry, you essentially forfeited your privacy and your right to your own political ideas and affiliations.\"",
      "Screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, one of the Hollywood Ten, spent 10 months in prison. His daughter, Mitzi, was 5 years old at the time. Her drawings and letters to him are on display in the exhibit, as well as testimony from those who named suspected Communists.",
      "\"In an effort to save themselves, their careers and their reputations, many, you know, creatives felt compelled to name names, which is what the committee wanted,\" Lessy said.",
      "Even Walt Disney famously testified before the committee.",
      "\"Walt Disney very much objected to labor organizing that had taken place in his studios and blamed it on Communist infiltration,\" Lessy said. \"And then you also have Ronald Reagan, who at the time, was president of the Screen Actors Guild. While he didn't name names in public, he did to the committee's investigator. And he went on to very much endorse the anti-Communist crusade.\"",
      "The blacklist later expanded to include classically trained pianist Hazel Scott, the first Black entertainer to have a nationally syndicated TV show. But the show was canceled after she was named in an anti-Communist pamphlet.",
      "Once out of prison, Trumbo used pseudonyms to write the Academy Award-winning films \"The Brave One\" and \"Roman Holiday.\"",
      "\"So it took about four decades...for the Academy Awards to finally recognize Dalton Trumbo,\" Lessy said. \"And...that was seen as the beginning of eroding of the committee's power.\"",
      "The impact of the Red Scare also extended beyond Hollywood.",
      "\"A number of regular Americans got caught up in this anti-Communist fervor, members of labor unions, high school teachers,\" Lessy said. \"College professors also came under scrutiny. There was a well-known publication called Red Channels that would provide very detailed information on a wide range of creatives. And so even just your name appearing in one of these publications was enough to get you blacklisted.\"",
      "By the 1960s, as the Red Scare had faded, so too did the blacklist's power. And in 1975, the House Un-American Activities Committee was abolished.",
      "\"I think it [the Hollywood blacklist] raises important questions about how to protect a robust democracy,\" Lessy said. \"How do we protect our rights and freedoms, particularly freedom of speech...If you hold unpopular views, should you be punished? Should you lose your job? These are all questions we should be wrestling with.\"",

    "summary": "Paramount Global and Skydance Media agreed to merge last year.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Skydance has made written commitments to ensuring that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum and that CBS's reporting will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based,\" Carr said in the statement.",
      "Carr also noted the company's commitment to local news coverage and said Skydance \"will work closely with its affiliated broadcast stations to ensure a productive partnership that will strengthen its affiliates' ability to serve their local communities.\"",
      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "The companies said in a statement Friday that the transaction is expected to close on Aug. 7.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",
      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",
      "\"It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America,\" Gomez said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bridget-everett-on-how-she-ended-up-as-somebody-somewhere/",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 13:18:51 -0400",
    "summary": "The actress and cabaret star put her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, on the map with the award-winning HBO series about a Midwestern woman returning home and working through grief. She returned to Manhattan, to talk about her surreal journey.",
    "story": [
      "Bridget Everett will try to tell you she's not a celebrity in Manhattan, Kansas, but don't believe her. She did grow up here, one of six kids, so there's that. \"I just love that it still feels like small-town America,\" she said. \"I come back quite a bit and I visit the same spots.\"",
      "But it was when her HBO show \"Somebody Somewhere\" was set here in Manhattan, that Everett became a bon fide local legend.",
      "The show follows Sam Miller (played by Everett), who moves back to her hometown in her 40s, trying to figure out herself, and life, after the death of her sister. Everett was a writer, producer, and lead actor in the semi-autobiographical series. \"I was like, 'Is anybody going to watch this? This is not a cool show!'\" she said. \"You know, like, it's about friendship. I'm not a top model, you know? I don't want to speak for anybody else in the cast! But I think that's exactly kind of why it works.\"",
      "Unlike her character on the show, who returns home to Manhattan, Kansas, Everett stayed in Manhattan, New York, for years, working mostly as a waitress and using, believe or not, karaoke as her main creative outlet.",
      "\"My way of connecting with people is through singing,\" she said. \"It kind of always has been, and it's easier for me to unlock and kind of be who I really want to be when I'm singing.",
      "Those karaoke performances led to her own, now-legendary cabaret shows at the famed Joe's Pub in New York. Everett's performances are sort of unlike anything you've seen, and so risqu\u00e9 we can't show you much of it here on \"Sunday Morning.\"",
      "Everett said, \"What's interesting to me is, like, learning about people, and why am I up there with no bra and a low-cut thing with everything flying around? It's part of who I am, and I also kind of do it to understand myself, honestly. I like to talk about my family in this way because my family and I don't talk about it. I don't see a mental health care professional!\"",
      "And that's the amazing part: Everett's cabaret shows somehow end up being, in part anyway, a meditation on life and grief, including saying goodbye to her father, as well as the loss of her mother, sister, and her beloved dog, Poppy, whom she called the love of her life. \"For a while I felt a little bit of shame saying that, because romantic love is kind of what most people aspire to,\" Everett said. \"My life is driven in a different way. She just taught me how to love, and she just cracked my heart open in a way that, like, no other person could.\"",
      "In fact, it was this side of Everett that HBO and the show's creators wanted to highlight \u2013 the way we can feel both strong and broken, hopeless and hopeful, all in the same moment.",
      "Everett, who writes and performs multiple original songs on the show, says she got her love of music from her mother, Freddie. She also got her sense of humor from her mom, as well as her siblings, including Brock, Brian and Brad, who had given Bridget a piece of feedback: that her acting was improving. \"I was being honest,\" Brad said. \"Her acting, especially towards the end, I thought, was authentic. I even teared up on some of that, which is difficult to do when you know your sibling [is] acting. So, you need to separate who you know, and then see her in a character. And have it move you? I think it's a great compliment to her.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Bridget. \"You could have just said that in a text.\"",
      "The HBO show features a number of Everett's actual friends and collaborators from New York, including Murray Hill, Mary Catherine Garrison, and, in a star turn, the just Emmy-nominated Jeff Hiller as her best friend, Joel.",
      "Though HBO chose not to renew \"Somebody Somewhere\" for a fourth season, it did win a prestigious Peabody Award, and also picked up an Emmy nomination this season for writing for a comedy series.",
      "Everett says the whole thing feels a little surreal: the journey from being somebody somewhere, to somebody who is right where she's supposed to be.",
      "\"Nothing will ever match this, and it couldn't, but that's okay,\" she said. \"A lot of people don't get the opportunity to have a TV show, to live a life beyond their wildest dreams. And then to get to do it with the people I love? It's why it's taken so long for me to move on and kind of let go. But now I'm just trying to celebrate that I got to do it at all.\"",

Social media lit up with discussion of a possible reunion, seven years after Buckingham was fired from Fleetwood Mac.",

That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",

      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",

      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

    "summary": "President Trump met with top European officials demanding fairer trade with the 27-member European Union at his golf course on the Scottish coast.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Sunday that the United States and the European Union had reached a trade deal after high-stakes meetings in Scotland, just days shy of Friday's White House deadline to enact tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump met with top European officials demanding fairer trade with the 27-member European Union at his golf course on the Scottish coast.",
      "\"It was a very interesting negotiation. I think it's going to be great for both parties,\" the president said.",
      "The deal, according to European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, is a 15% tariff across the board. She praised Mr. Trump, calling it a \"good deal\" and a \"huge deal\" that followed \"tough negotiations.\"",
      "\"We have a deal. We have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world, and it's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" she said. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said, \"I think we both wanted to make a deal,\" and he predicted it would \"bring us closer together.\" Mr. Trump also said more than once to reporters Sunday that it was the \"biggest of all the deals.\"",
      "Von der Leyen said the negotiations addressed the EU's trade surplus with the U.S., and the deal would be carried out in a way that would enable trade to continue while jobs on \"both sides of the Atlantic\" would be rebalanced.",
      "According to Mr. Trump, the deal also includes that all European Union countries will be \"opened up for U.S. goods\" at 0% and the bloc will invest $600 billion in the U.S. The EU will also purchase $750 billion of U.S. energy as part of the deal.",
      "\"They are going to agree to invest into the United States $600 billion more than they're investing already,\" Mr. Trump said. \"So they're investing a large amount of money. You know what that amount of money is--It's very substantial.\"",
      "In remarks before the session, Mr. Trump pledged to change what he characterized as \"a very one-sided transaction, very unfair to the United States.\"",
      "\"I think the main sticking point is fairness,\" he said while also noting, \"We've had a hard time with trade with Europe, a very hard time.\"",
      "Without a deal, Mr. Trump had threatened to hit imports from the EU's 27 member countries with a 30% tariff rate. The president has long been critical of the U.S.-EU trade relationship, claiming the U.S. has been treated unfairly. Last year, the U.S. trade deficit with the EU was about $235 billion.",
      "Joining von der Leyen were Maros Sefcovic, the EU's chief trade negotiator; Bj\u00f6rn Seibert, the head of von der Leyen's Cabinet; Sabine Weyand, the commission's directorate-general for trade, and Tomas Baert, head of trade and agriculture at the EU's delegation to the U.S.",
      "Von der Leyen had a mandate to negotiate because the European Commission handles trade for member countries. But the Commission should now present the deal to member states and EU lawmakers \u2014 who will ultimately decide whether or not to approve it",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Sunday welcomed the trade deal, which he said avoided \"needless escalation in transatlantic trade relations.\"",
      "\"We have thus managed to preserve our fundamental interests, even if I would have wished for more relief in transatlantic trade,\" he said in a statement released soon after the deal was announced.",

    "summary": "A dating advice app that lets women anonymously review their dates and compare notes has surged in popularity.",
    "story": [
      "The most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store currently isn't ChatGPT, Threads or Google. It's Tea, a dating advice app that lets women review men they've gone out with, as well as warn other single women about dates they claim went awry.",
      "Tea Dating Advice, an app for helping women vet their dates, is also a top app on the Google Play Store, where it's been downloaded more than 100,000 times.",
      "The app's maker says it offers a measure of security for users that traditional dating apps\u00a0don't. Tea doesn't match singles with potential dates; rather, it's a place for women to share information about men they've dated. Tea lets users run background checks on potential matches, check to see if they have criminal records or appear on sex offender databases, and more, all through the app.",
      "The app also ensures that users who sign up are women by requesting that they submit a selfie for verification. That's aimed at protecting users against so-called catfishing schemes, in which people create fake online personas, often as part of a scheme to defraud others.",
      "Tea declined to comment for this article.",
      "Safety in numbers",
      "To be sure, most of the features that Tea offers already exist. Social media forums, such as the Facebook group called \"Are we dating the same guy?,\" also let women compare notes about their dates in a community forum. The main difference: scale. Tea has more than 1.6 million users, according to its website.",
      "\"What this app seems to be doing is centralizing all that into one very large community,\" Doug Zytko, an associate professor at the University of Michigan-Flint who researches human-computer interactions for safety, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Zytko, who has extensively studied dating app designs, said that safety \"has not been prioritized\" for most such tools in the market, which he said helps explain why Tea has struck a chord with women.",
      "\"The dating app safety features that exist are largely reactive in nature. They're not about keeping people safe, but are punitive actions one can take after something has occurred,\" he added.",
      "Zytko also acknowledged the concerns of some men, voiced on forums like Reddit, that Tea users could share false information about them.",
      "\"If inaccurate information about a man is being shared, that damages his dating prospects and social reputation,\" Zytko said. \"That's scary, but it's not a reason to discount the app.\"",
      "Another potential risk is one common to all social media platform, and digital information more broadly. Tea confirmed to CBS News that its app was hacked Friday morning, with bad actors accessing a data storage system containing information, including selfies, that members had uploaded prior to February 2024.",
      "Additionally, hackers accessed almost 60,000 images from posts, plus comments and direct messages, the company said.",
      "\"Tea has engaged third-party cybersecurity experts and are working around the clock to secure its systems,\" the company said in a statement, noting that it is investigating the incident. \"At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that additional user data was affected.\"",

    "summary": "Paramount Global and Skydance Media agreed to merge last year.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction. Paramount is the parent company of CBS.",
      "\"Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\" FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. \"It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance's commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\"",
      "He referenced Skydance's commitment to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years. Skydance also affirmed that the company will not have DEI initiatives.",
      "\"Skydance has made written commitments to ensuring that the new company's array of news and entertainment programming will embody a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum and that CBS's reporting will be fair, unbiased, and fact-based,\" Carr said in the statement.",
      "Carr also noted the company's commitment to local news coverage and said Skydance \"will work closely with its affiliated broadcast stations to ensure a productive partnership that will strengthen its affiliates' ability to serve their local communities.\"",
      "The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands.",
      "The companies said in a statement Friday that the transaction is expected to close on Aug. 7.",
      "Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen.",
      "Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.",
      "Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million \u2014 most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library \u2014 and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, issued a statement on Thursday dissenting from the decision to approve the merger.",
      "\"I cannot support this order approving this transaction in light of the payout and other troubling concessions Paramount made to settle a baseless lawsuit,\" she wrote. \"...In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom.\" Carr has said that Mr. Trump's lawsuit was not a factor in his agency's review of the deal.",
      "\"It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America,\" Gomez said.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Jul 2025 17:12:26 -0400",
    "summary": "With the Trump administration setting 15% as a floor for tariffs, companies and economists are warning of higher prices later this year.",
    "story": [
      "The new normal for U.S. tariffs on foreign goods starts at 15%. Even as President Trump seeks to forge new terms of trade\u00a0with Japan, the European Union and other global economic partners, he is raising the floor for tariffs to their highest level in decades.",
      "Speaking\u00a0at an AI summit on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said \"we'll have a straight, simple tariff of anywhere between 15% and 50%,\" conditioning the lower rate on countries opening their economies to the U.S.",
      "The White House has said sharply higher tariffs could take effect on dozens of countries as soon as Aug. 1 unless they ink new trade deals. The Trump administration has a separate negotiating timeline with China, which faces an Aug. 12 deadline for an agreement.",
      "As these new rules of international commerce take shape, companies across a range of industries are emphasizing that higher tariffs translate into higher operational costs \u2014 and higher prices for consumers.",
      "For example, Nestl\u00e9 on Thursday said it was considering hiking prices for candy bars and other products as tariffs threaten to eat into the food company's profit margins. The same day, Italian fashion brand Moncler said it has already hiked prices for its apparel to offset additional tariff-related costs. And General Electric said this week that proposed U.S. tariffs, should they take effect, would cost the company around $500 million in 2025, noting that it would move to offset those taxes through \"cost controls and pricing actions.\"",
      "Orange juice importer Johanna Foods has gone a step further, this week filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its proposed\u00a050% tariff on Brazil, which the New Jersey company said would seriously hurt its business and force it to hike product prices by up to 25%.",
      "The White House disputes that higher U.S. tariffs will drive up costs for businesses and consumers.",
      "\"The administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be borne by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's biggest and best consumer market,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "Desai also pointed to a recent analysis by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that he said shows import prices falling this year.",
      "Price hikes not \"instantaneous\"",
      "Economists warn that consumers should brace for higher prices on a range of goods, from leather products and clothing to electronics and automobiles, later this year.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note. \"Now that the Trump administration is concluding deals that would see the tariff rate facing most trading partners settling at between 15% and 20%, with even higher rates levied on Chinese imports, we suspect retailers will be forced to finally raise the prices paid by consumers.\"",
      "Inflation in the early part of 2025 remained fairly contained. That's because many companies and consumers accelerated their purchases of imported goods to avoid the risk of paying more if, or when, steep new tariffs take effect.",
      "Meanwhile, in the short-term, sharply higher prices are unlikely across the board, according to trade experts.",
      "\"When you open up the hood of that, it's not going to be even across all categories of spending,\" Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's categories of spending where we import more that are going to be more sensitive to tariffs.\"",
      "But over the longer term, an increased baseline tariff, coupled wtih higher levies on individual countries, is projected to drive up U.S. prices by 2% over the next two years, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "\"This isn't an instantaneous, 'We wake up the next morning and the world is different,'\" Tedeschi added.",
      "But as the new U.S. tariff regime becomes embedded in global supply chains, some import-heavy product categories could see especially sharp price increases, he said. Specifically, foreign-made leather shoes and handbags, along with apparel, could see prices spike by at least 40%, while the cost of electronics could jump more than 20%, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "Federal debt, which currently stands at more than $36 trillion, is projected to rise due to the new tax cuts and spending bill signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, according to forecasts from economists and public policy think tanks. The nation's deficit could rise by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years because of the impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Bipartisan Policy Center\u00a0said, citing estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation.",
      "Mr. Trump added that the rebate could be \"for people of a certain income level,\" although he didn't specify the threshold that he's considering.",
      "The federal government has collected about $100 billion in tariff revenue since the Trump administration instituted its higher import duties earlier this year, which could increase to $300 billion per year, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business' \"Mornings with Maria\" on Tuesday.",
      "Tariffs vary from country to country, but they're paid by U.S. importers, such as Walmart, or manufacturers that import materials and components from other countries, like Ford Motor. So far, some companies have been\u00a0swallowing the higher costs\u00a0rather than passing them on to consumers, although the\u00a0latest inflation report\u00a0signaled that higher tariff rates may be edging into consumer prices.",
      "Rebate checks have been floated by Mr. Trump previously, with the president saying in February he was considering using 20% of the savings from Elon Musk's cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to provide direct payments to taxpayers. During the pandemic, taxpayers received three rebate checks \u2014 two under the first Trump administration, and the third under the Biden administration \u2014 aimed at offsetting the economic impact of the crisis.",
      "Typically, such rebates are issued through the tax code, which would require Congress to pass new tax legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to issue checks.",
      "Lawmakers earlier this month passed a massive tax and spending bill that was signed into law by Mr. Trump on July 4, which authorizes some new tax breaks, but doesn't include a rebate based on tariffs.",
      "Some of the bill's new tax cuts are limited to low- and middle-income taxpayers. For instance, its new $6,000 deduction for senior citizens phases out for single taxpayers with incomes over $75,000 and married filers with earnings over $150,000.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration is releasing billions of dollars in grants to schools for adult literacy, English language instruction and other programs, the Education Department said Friday.",
      "President Trump's administration had withheld more than $6 billion in funding on July 1, as part of a review to ensure spending aligned with the White House's priorities.",
      "The funding freeze had been challenged by several lawsuits as educators, members of Congress from both parties and others called for the administration to release money schools rely on for a wide range of programs. Congress had appropriated the money in a bill signed this year by Mr. Trump.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed the release of the funds, and said \"[g]uardrails are in place to ensure these funds will not be used in violation of Executive Orders or administration policy.\" A spokesperson for the Department of Education said the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the programs and the money would be begin to be dispersed next week.",
      "Last week, the department said it would release $1.3 billion of the money for after-school and summer programming. Without the money, school districts and nonprofits such as the YMCA and Boys and Girls Club of America had said they would have to close or scale back educational offerings this fall.",
      "The release of that money came days after 10 Republican senators sent a letter imploring the administration to allow frozen education money to be sent to states. Those senators had also called for the rest of the money to be distributed, including funds for adult education and teaching English as a second language.",
      "Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia was among the lawmakers calling for the release of the grants.",
      "\"The programs are ones that enjoy longstanding, bipartisan support,\" she said. She pointed to after-school and summer programs that allow parents to work while their children learn and classes that help adults gain new skills, contributing to local economies.",
      "In withholding the funds, the Office of Management and Budget had said some of the programs supported a \"radical leftwing agenda. \"",
      "\"We share your concern,\" the GOP senators had written. \"However, we do not believe that is happening with these funds.\"",
      "School superintendents had warned they would have to eliminate academic services without the money. On Friday, AASA, an association of superintendents, thanked members of Congress for pressing to release the money.",
      "In Harford County, Maryland, some of the withheld federal money made up more than half the budget for the district's annual summer camp for kids learning English. The money helps the district hire certified teachers to staff the camp, incorporating learning into children's play for four weeks during the summer. The program helps kids keep their English and academic momentum over the summer.",
      "The district serves roughly 1,100 students who are non-native English speakers. Many of them are born in the U.S. to parents who came to the area seeking job opportunities, often in the restaurants and warehouses that have popped up in the past decades in the region northeast of Baltimore. During the school year, the soon-to-be-released federal money pays for tutors for kids learning English.",
      "On Thursday, more than 350 children filled the second floor of Bel Air High School for the second-to-last day of summer camp. Young learners crowded around an alphabet wheel, jostling with each other to push each letter button as they thought of foods starting with letters from A to Z.",
      "Middle school students watched a robotics team demonstration, and a few sheepishly raised their hands when asked if they would be interested in joining. High school student volunteers, some of whom had been campers learning English themselves not many years ago, helped the youngest children with art projects.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 23:35:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump visited the Federal Reserve's headquarters in Washington, keeping up the intense pressure he's been putting on Fed chair Jerome Powell.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a disagreement almost immediately as the two men set foot in the Fed's headquarters in Washington on Thursday to survey an\u00a0extensive renovation project\u00a0on two of the reserve's buildings.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump indicated that Powell's\u00a0handling of\u00a0the massive project and its cost overruns could be grounds for firing. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't think firing Powell is necessary.",
      "Mr. Trump and Powell appeared side by side on the construction site Thursday \u2014 both in hard hats \u2014 with the president insisting costs have increased further, reaching $3.1 billion. Powell shook his head and said he hadn't heard that figure from anyone at the Fed. Mr. Trump handed a document to Powell, who put on his glasses to review it.",
      "\"You just added in a third building is what that is \u2014 that's a third building,\" Powell said of the Federal Reserve's Martin building.",
      "\"Well, I know but it's a building that's being built,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"No \u2014 it was built five years ago. We finished Martin five years ago,\" Powell told the president.",
      "\"It's part of the overall work,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"It's not new,\" Powell reiterated.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Powell if he expects any further cost overruns. Powell said he does not. The project is expected to be completed in 2027.",
      "After a tour of the construction site, Mr. Trump called the project \"a very luxurious situation.\" But asked if the project's cost and overruns are a fireable offense for Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"Look, I would love to see it completed. I don't want to put that in this category. It's a very complex thing that could have been made simple.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he feels \"good\" about his relationship with Powell and they had a \"productive\" conversation Thursday, but reiterated that interest rates need to come down.",
      "\"I just want to see one thing happen, very simple \u2014 interest rates have to come down,\" he said.",
      "A reporter asked Mr. Trump why he doesn't fire Powell now, instead of replacing him when his term is up in 2026.",
      "\"To do that is a big move, I just don't think it's necessary,\" the president responded. \"And I believe he's going to do the right thing.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has criticized Powell for months because the Fed has kept the short-term interest rate the Fed controls at 4.3% this year \u2014 after cutting it three times last year. Powell says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr.\u00a0Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated the president, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt.",
      "The Fed has been renovating its Washington headquarters and a neighboring building. With some of the construction occurring underground and as building materials have soared in price after inflation spiked in 2021 and 2022, the estimated cost has ballooned to about $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion.",
      "When asked last week if the costly rebuilding could be grounds to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said, \"I think it is.\"",
      "\"When you spend $2.5 billion on, really, a renovation, I think it's really disgraceful,\" the president said.",
      "Firing Powell would threaten the Fed's independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors, and would almost certainly rattle financial markets.",
      "Mr. Trump has at various times referred to his handpicked Fed chair as a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule.\"",
      "The president asked a group of House Republicans in an Oval Office meeting\u00a0last week\u00a0if he should fire Powell, sources told CBS News. Mr. Trump told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he would, though he\u00a0confirmed\u00a0he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Renovations have been underway for years",
      "Plans for the Fed's renovation were first approved by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in 2017. The project then went through several local commissions for approval, at least one of which, the Commission for Fine Arts, included several Trump appointees. The commission\u00a0pushed for more marble\u00a0in the second of the two buildings the Fed is renovating, known as 1951 Constitution Avenue, specifically in a mostly glass extension that some of Trump's appointees derided as a \"glass box.\"",
      "The National Planning Commission, another local body, pushed the Fed to add marble to a rooftop addition.",
      "Fed staff also said tariffs and inflationary increases in building material costs also drove up costs. Mr. Trump in 2018 imposed a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. Steel prices are up about 60% since the plans were approved in June, while construction materials costs overall are up about 50%, according to government data.",
      "Fed staff also pointed to the complication of historic renovations \u2014 both buildings have significant preservation needs. Constructing a new building on an empty site would have been cheaper.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 17:50:10 -0400",
    "summary": "A growing number of employers in tech and other fields are recruiting workers with expertise in AI, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",
      "What kind of AI jobs?",
      "The burgeoning AI job market involves a mix of skill sets ranging from advanced AI-specific roles, such as AI engineers, to more general AI-related positions such as software developers, according to Elena Magrini, global head of research at Lightcast.",
      "In 2025, more than 80,000 job postings mentioned generative AI skills, up from 3,780 in 2010, \u00a0according to Brookings.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the accelerating adoption of AI by businesses is spurring demand for consultants who can help companies integrate AI. Job listings relating to so-called responsible AI\u00a0jobs, which focus on the ethical use of AI tools in business and society, are also on the rise, according to Indeed.",
      "\"In other words, the definition of what it means to be an 'AI job' is changing every day as businesses find new and creative ways to incorporate the technology responsibly,\" Stahle said.",
      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

      "The reversal of the policy to eliminate paper checks comes after Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, met with Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano on Wednesday morning and asked about the plan to discontinue paper checks, along with other changes at the agency.",
      "\"There are about 600,000 Americans who still receive their paper checks \u2014 it's a small fraction of people who receive Social Security payments, but it's a population that often needs checks through paper\" versus electronic deposit, Warren said in a press call to discuss her meeting with Bisignano.",

    "summary": "Trump is set to visit Scotland, his mother's ancestral home, where he owns two golf courses, for a mix of business and pleasure. But some Scots are taking no pleasure.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump is due to arrive Friday for what the White House is calling a \"working visit\" to Scotland. It's expected to include a mix of both personal time and political business. As was the case during his last visit as president in 2018, he is likely to be greeted by protests everywhere he goes in his mother's native land.",
      "The plan is for Mr. Trump to pay visits to his two luxury golf resorts in Scotland, Trump International on the east coast of Aberdeenshire, which he bought in 2012, and Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire, about 200 miles away on the west coast, which he purchased in 2014.",
      "During his visit, he's also set to meet Scotland's top official, First Minister John Swinney, who publicly backed Kamala Harris' presidential bid against Mr. Trump last year.",
      "The American leader will also meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer near the end of his trip in Scotland, and the current 25% U.S. tariffs on British steel imports could be a focus of discussion.",
      "Trump visits bring protests and security concerns",
      "Mr. Trump has Scottish roots through his mother, who was born in 1912 as Mary Anne MacLeod on the Scottish island of Lewis in the remote Outer Hebrides.",
      "But despite his ancestry, Mr. Trump can likely expect a lukewarm to cold reception on Scottish soil. Some Scots believe the American real estate mogul-turned-president has been good for the country, bringing in investment and with it, some employment, but others criticize the policies he has adopted during his second term.",
      "In advance of Mr. Trump's arrival, the Stop Trump Scotland protest group has been organizing demonstrations at Aberdeen and outside the U.S. consulate in Scotland's capital, Edinburgh \u2014 part of a so-called \"Festival of Resistance\" that aims to mix city-based actions with countryside activism around Mr. Trump's golf resorts.",
      "The demonstrations are slated to include large banners and messages in the sand of Scotland's coastline, intended to be visible to the president as he lands",
      "A senior Scottish police official told Britain's Sky News it would be \"inappropriate\" to ignore the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump a year ago.",
      "\"There's a broad range of considerations,\" said Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Emma Bond. \"It would be inappropriate for me to plan an operation and not bear in mind what has happened in other parts of the world. But with that in mind, we've got a really experienced team of officers working as part of planning the operation.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's 2018 trip to Scotland, CBS News' partner network BBC News says there were more than 5,000 police officers deployed, with the U.K. Treasury chipping in about \u00a35 million ($6.8 million) to help cover the costs to the Scottish police force.",
      "Trump's visit is private, but with some politics",
      "While he made his preference for Mr. Trump's opponent clear before the last U.S. election, the head of Scotland's government said it was his duty to meet with the U.S. president during his upcoming visit.",
      "\"I've taken a decision that's in Scotland's interest to meet with the president of the United States so that I can use every opportunity to protect and to promote the interests of the people of Scotland,\" Swinney told Britain's PA news agency. \"There's obviously a range of issues that we can cover around the international situation that's causing such anxiety to people in Scotland, around the situation the Middle East, and the situation in Ukraine, and the domestic issues that are important to us around about the implications of, for example, trade and tariffs on some of our key sectors, including Scotch whisky.\"",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to meet on Monday with Prime Minister Starmer, but due to it being officially a private visit, neither the White House nor Starmer's office have revealed much about what the two may do or discuss. For Starmer, however, keeping discussions going about U.S. tariffs imposed since Mr. Trump came back to the White House will likely be a key theme.",
      "President Trump has imposed 25% tariffs on imported British steel. Starmer hopes to get that rate lowered, to zero if possible, to shore up the U.K.'s steel industry, which has seen its output plummet by around 80% since the 1960's.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that the two leaders would meet \"to refine the historic U.S.-U.K. trade deal\" brokered in May.",
      "Mr. Trump will return to the U.K. for an unprecedented second official state visit on September 17, during which he is scheduled to meet with King Charles III. Starmer hand-delivered the invitation for that visit, on behalf of the monarch, when he visited Mr. Trump at the White House in February.",

      "In a Wednesday statement, Uber said that women customers will see an option called \"women drivers\" in the app. If the wait time for a woman driver is longer than they would like, they can pick another ride \u2014 presumably with a male driver \u2014 for a quicker pickup, the company said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loan-forgiveness-ibr-debt-payments-education-department-cbs-news-explains/",
    "published": "Wed, 23 Jul 2025 14:48:17 -0400",
    "summary": "The Education Department has temporarily paused loan forgiveness for an income-based repayment plan. Here are the details.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people with student loans who are enrolled in a popular repayment plan are now in limbo, with the Department of Education saying it has temporarily paused forgiveness for borrowers in its income-based repayment plan, or IBR.",
      "Such plans offer a double benefit for borrowers by lowering a person's monthly loan repayment to reflect their income, while also promising to provide forgiveness after a number of years. Specifically, the government can cancel the balance of student loan after people have made payments for at least 20 years.",
      "About 40% of the roughly 33 million people repaying student loans were enrolled in one of the Education Department's four such repayment plans at the end of 2024, according to data from the National Student Loan Data System and the Government Accountability Office.",
      "But three of those programs had previously been halted by a court ruling, while forgiveness for the roughly 2 million people enrolled in the fourth \u2014 IBR \u2014 is now also paused.",
      "On Tuesday, Education Department deputy press secretary Ellen Keast told CBS MoneyWatch that the agency \"has temporarily paused discharges for IBR borrowers in order to comply with ongoing court injunctions regarding the Biden Administration's illegal attempts at student loan forgiveness.\"",
      "The court injunctions stem from 2024\u00a0lawsuits related to the Biden administration's flagship student loan repayment plan, called the\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan. That initiative, created to fix long-standing issues with the Education Department's previous income-based plans, proved popular with borrowers, with almost 8 million enrollees at the end of 2024, National Student Loan Data System data shows.",
      "Because the SAVE plan could count toward loan discharges in the IBR program, the Education Department is now temporarily halting forgiveness for enrollees in that plan. The Education Department said the loan discharges will resume at some point, but didn't provide a timeframe for when that might occur.",
      "What income-driven repayment plans are legally blocked?",
      "Student loan forgiveness under three of the federal government's income-driven plans \u2014 SAVE; Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR); and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) \u2014 is currently paused after a court ruled last summer that Congress exceeded its authority in approving those plans.",
      "The legal action last year called into question whether student loan forgiveness was authorized under the federal statute that governs those plans. But the IBR plan was created under a different authority.",
      "When will the Education Department start forgiving loans again?",
      "The Education Department didn't specify a timeframe in its statement to CBS MoneyWatch. It noted that the SAVE plan allowed forbearances \u2014 when loan payments are temporarily halted or reduced \u2014 to be counted toward loan forgiveness, but that the rule was halted by the court ruling.",
      "Because of the injunction, the Education Department said it needs to recalculate how many payments made by borrowers should contribute toward repayment.",
      "\"Legal IBR discharges will resume as soon as the Department is able to establish the correct payment count,\" said Keast of the Education Department.",
      "Should a borrower continue making IBR payments for now?",
      "Yes. Borrowers in the federal IBR plan are eligible to have their student loans canceled after making payments for at least 20 years. However, some people eligible for such forgiveness have yet to see their loans canceled. They should continue making those payments, and the Education Department will eventually refund them, according to the agency.",
      "\"For any borrower that makes a payment after the date of borrower eligibility, the Department will refund overpayments when the discharges resume,\" Keast said.",
      "Borrowers can also request forbearance from their loan servicer. In that case, interest would continue to accrue on any remaining balance.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Monday told federal workers they can talk about religion at work, including by trying to \"persuade others of the correctness of their own religious views.\"",
      "In a memo to the heads of federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Management \u2014 the government's human resources arm \u2014 said public employees have the right to religious expression in the workplace, citing civil rights law and the First Amendment. That includes the right to discuss religion, engage in \"communal religious expressions\" and display items such as bibles, crucifixes and mezuzahs on their desks, the memo states.",
      "\"During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs,\" it states. \"However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request.\"",
      "The five-page memo listed out other examples of religious expression that federal workers shouldn't be punished for. OPM said in its memo that employees can invite co-workers who belong to other religions to their church or put up invitations to Easter services on communal bulletin boards; staff can display religious posters, Veterans Affairs doctors can pray over their patients, and park rangers for the National Park Service can join their tour groups in prayer.",
      "According to the memo, agencies can still broadly limit staffers' speech \u2014 for example, they can \"require that employees perform official work while on duty,\" and they can ban employees from putting up posters of any kind, both religious and non-religious. It also said attempts to persuade co-workers about religion can't be \"harassing in nature.\"",
      "Still, staff \"must be allowed to engage in private religious expression in work areas to the same extent that they may engage in nonreligious private expression,\" the office said.",
      "The policy isn't entirely new. In 1997, the Clinton administration said federal employees can \"discuss their religious views with one another\" and \"may even attempt to persuade fellow employees of the correctness of their religious views\" \u2014 but they \"must refrain from such expression when a fellow employee asks that it stop.\"",
      "For years, the Department of Labor's online religious discrimination guidelines have said staffers \"who seek to proselytize in the workplace should cease doing so with respect to any individual who indicates that the communications are unwelcome.\"",
      "\"Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,\" OPM Director Scott Kupor said Monday in a statement. \"This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths.\"",
      "Monday's memo comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration to let federal workers express religious beliefs. Earlier this month, OPM said federal agencies should \"adopt a generous approach\" when staffers ask for permission to work from home or change their schedules for religious reasons, citing a 2023 Supreme Court case in which a mail carrier requested Sundays off for religious reasons.",
      "In early February, shortly after returning to office, President Trump signed an executive order accusing the Biden administration of pervasive \"anti-Christian weaponization of government.\" The order set up a task force to look into alleged anti-Christian bias. Months later, the State Department encouraged staff to report any allegations of bias.",
      "The moves have drawn pushback. The Freedom From Religion Foundation called Monday's memo \"outrageous and unconstitutional,\" arguing the guidance \"purports to protect religious expression in the federal workplace but encourages outright proselytizing.\"",
      "\"These shocking changes essentially permit workplace evangelizing, but worse still, allow supervisors to evangelize underlings and federal workers to proselytize the public they serve,\" the group's co-president, Annie Laurie Gaylor, said in a statement.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration accused Judge Boasberg on Monday of making \"improper public comments\" about President Trump, after months of sparring over the government's deportation policies.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Monday filed a misconduct complaint against U.S. District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg, who has sparred with the Trump administration for months over its deportations of Venezuelan men to El Salvador.",
      "The complaint accuses Boasberg of \"making improper public comments about President Trump and his Administration,\" according to a copy obtained by CBS News. Attorney General Pam Bondi directed her chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, to file the complaint, a Justice Department source told CBS News.",
      "In the complaint, Mizelle cites Boasberg's attendance at a Judicial Conference of the United States on March 11, in which the judge warned that the Trump administration could \"disregard rulings of federal courts\" and trigger a \"constitutional crisis.\"",
      "Mizelle also cites Boasberg's handling of a case involving alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who were flown to a Salvadoran prison earlier this year. Boasberg ordered the planes to turn around on March 15, after the Trump administration removed the men under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg subsequently held hearings in the case in which he has lambasted the conduct of Justice Department attorneys and questioned whether the Trump administration is acting in good faith to guarantee due process for those it has removed from the U.S. or intends to remove.",
      "\"Throughout the proceedings, Judge Boasberg rushed the government through complex litigation, sometimes giving the Trump Administration less than 48 hours to respond and threatening criminal-contempt proceedings and the appointment of an outside prosecutor against senior Trump Administration officials for failing to comply with an order that had already been vacated,\" Mizelle wrote.",
      "Bondi wrote in a post on X that the judge's remarks \"have undermined the integrity of the judiciary, and we will not stand for that.\"",
      "The complaint was addressed to the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Sri Srinivasan. Typically, complaints about judges are first reviewed by the chief judge of the appellate circuit, who can either dismiss them or refer them to a committee for investigation. After that, a council of judges decides whether to take corrective action, which can include reprimanding the judge and avoiding assigning new cases.",
      "Judges can only be removed from the bench through impeachment proceedings, which requires two-thirds of senators to vote to remove them.",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration filed a similar complaint against D.C. District Judge Ana Reyes for what they claimed was \"hostile and egregious misconduct\" during a hearing in February over the Trump administration's attempts to ban transgender servicemembers from the military. The D.C. Circuit has not yet addressed the Reyes complaint.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Boasberg's chambers for comment.",
      "Boasberg accuses Trump administration of \"obstructionism\"",
      "In April, Boasberg said there was probable cause to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over what he said was its defiance of his order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador.",
      "Dozens were put on two planes on March 15, removed to El Salvador and placed in detention at CECOT, a maximum security prison, despite an order issued by Boasberg to stop the removals and turn around the planes.",
      "Boasberg said in his April decision that the government's actions \"demonstrate a willful disregard\" for his order barring the government from transferring certain migrants into Salvadoran custody under the Alien Enemies Act, which previously had been invoked only three times in history, while the nation was at war.",
      "He accused the government of \"increasing obstructionism\" and \"stonewalling\" over its refusal to answer basic questions that aimed to resolve whether noncitizens who were removable solely under Mr. Trump's proclamation were transferred out of U.S. custody after the judge issued his order forbidding their deportation.",
      "\"Defendants provide no convincing reason to avoid the conclusion that appears obvious from the above factual recitation: that they deliberately flouted this court's written order and, separately, its oral command that explicitly delineated what compliance entailed,\" Boasberg wrote.",
      "Boasberg's handling of the case has drawn pushback from the administration. In March, Mr. Trump called the judge \"Crooked\" and called for his impeachment.",

    "summary": "Trump says he's \"very disappointed\" with Vladimir Putin, and he's shortening the deadline for the Russian leader to agree a ceasefire with Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Monday a significant tightening of his deadline for Russia's Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said as he headed in for his meeting with Starmer that he was \"very disappointed\" in Russia's leader over the ongoing bombing of Ukrainian cities, and that the deadline he gave Russia a couple weeks ago to agree to a truce would be reduced.",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this month that if Russia failed to agree to a ceasefire within the 50-day timeframe, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that continue to do business with Russia. That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday, as he sat down with Starmer, that he was \"going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.\"",
      "\"There's no reason in waiting,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just don't see any progress being made.\"",
      "\"I've spoken to President Putin a lot, I've gotten along with him very well,\" Mr. Trump said earlier, before sitting down with Starmer.",
      "But he lamented that the Russian leader, \"goes out and starts launching rockets into some city, like Kyiv, and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever, you have bodies lying all over the street.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed in Putin,\" adding: \"I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number, because I think I already know the answer what's going to happen.\"",
      "Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm not so interested in talking anymore,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin, explaining that he and Putin will have a nice conversation, and then the following day, the Russians killed more Ukrainians.",
      "Seated alongside Starmer, Mr. Trump also addressed the situation in Gaza, saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid.",
      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.\"",
      "While ostensibly a private trip, marked by multiple rounds of golf on his own luxury courses in Scotland, Mr. Trump has also done business \u2013 including nailing down a long-sought-after\u00a0U.S.-European Union trade agreement.",
      "After meeting for just over one hour with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Mr. Trump emerged to say, \"We have good news. We've reached a deal.\"",
      "When considered as a combined economy, the EU bloc is the second largest in the world behind the U.S. Including goods and services, U.S.-EU trade is worth about $2 trillion per year.",
      "\"I think it's great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games,\" Mr. Trump said of the framework trade agreement. \"I think it's the biggest deal ever made.\"",
      "\"It's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" agreed Von der Leyen. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Starmer is also touching on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed on a framework trade deal\u00a0last month. Starmer has made it clear he wants to keep pushing Mr. Trump to further ease tariffs on British steel and other imports as the details of the agreement are hashed out.",
      "Mr. Trump said his meeting with Starmer would provide a chance to celebrate the U.S.-U.K. agreement, along with the new EU deal.",
      "Most EU member nations' governments voiced support for that agreement on Monday, though some of them unenthusiastically \u2013 and the French Prime Minister even took a jab at the bloc, accusing it of \"submission\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",
      "There was good news for U.S. companies that sell products into the EU market, too, as Mr. Trump announced that all 27 EU nations \"will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff.\"",
      "The agreement was made at Mr. Trump's luxury golf resort in Turnberry, on the Scottish coast, where the president spent the weekend teeing off.",
      "The deal avoids a trans-Atlantic trade war that could have unfolded on Friday, when Mr. Trump had threatened to impose a blanket 30% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, which had vowed to retaliate.",
      "That deadline remains in place for countries that have yet to make a deal with the U.S., including Mexico, Canada, and most consequentially, China. On Monday, Mr. Trump said tariffs for countries that don't reach a deal with the U.S. will be \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range,\" which differs from the 15% to 50% range he floated last week.",
      "Trade talks between Beijing and Washington were taking place Monday in Stockholm, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in interviews over the weekend that the Aug. 1 deadline for deals to be reached wasn't flexible.",
      "\"No extensions, no more grace periods. August 1, the tariffs are set. They'll go into place. Customs will start collecting the money, and off we go,\" Lutnick said.",

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

Mirigliano argued that Habba's reappointment after her nomination to become New Jersey's U.S. attorney is also unconstitutional. Politico first reported the request stemming from Habba's position.",
      "\"By circumventing the constitutionally mandated appointment procedures, and encroaching upon judicial powers explicitly granted by statute, the executive branch has exceeded its lawful authority,\" he wrote, adding that allowing the prosecution of his client to proceed under the current landscape \"would endorse an unconstitutional executive usurpation of judicial authority.\"",
      "The filing from Giraud is the latest twist in Habba's tenure as U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which came to a head last week as she neared the end of her limited term serving temporarily in the role.",
      "Federal law restricted Habba's time in the post to 120 days, unless the federal district court in the state extended her tenure or she won Senate confirmation. But New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination, making it highly unlikely it would advance through the upper chamber.",
      "Last week, judges on the district court in New Jersey invoked a rarely used authority when they declined to keep Habba in her role of interim U.S. attorney as her 120-day term was set to expire. In her place, the judges selected the No. 2 in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office, Desiree Leigh Grace, to serve as U.S. attorney for the state until another candidate for the job was nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "But after the district court's decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Grace, a career prosecutor in the office. Grace said she intended to still serve in the role, sparking confusion over who was leading the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Garden State.",
      "The White House then pulled Habba's nomination to serve as the top prosecutor, a Justice Department official said, as part of a multi-part scheme to keep her temporarily in charge of the office. Following the withdrawal and firing, Habba was appointed first assistant U.S. attorney, Grace's job before her removal, which cleared the way for her to temporarily fill the spot of U.S. attorney in New Jersey under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "The vacancies law limits Habba's time in the position to 210 days from when the vacancy occurred.",
      "Because New Jersey federal judges have a conflict of interest in the Giraud's case due to the order to remove Habba and appoint Grace, Mirigliano's motion has been assigned to Pennsylvania Judge Matthew Brann, who was appointed to the federal district court by President Barack Obama in 2012.",
      "Grace has not indicated whether or not she would challenge Habba's control of the office and seek to enforce the judges' order authorizing her appointment.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorneys Office in New Jersey did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the motion.",

    "summary": "Operation Grayskull helped shutter four heavily trafficked dark web sites where violent child sexual abuse materials were traded and housed.",
    "story": [
      "When FBI agents arrived outside William Spearman's home in the quiet suburb of Madison, Alabama, in November 2022, they were prepared for danger.",
      "Their search warrant was so important to the bureau that it was approved by the FBI director himself. When the agents breached Spearman's door with tactical explosives, Spearman fought back, tussling with the agents as three of his handguns remained barely out of reach.\tThe FBI managed to handcuff and arrest Spearman, a high-value arrest, in what a top Justice Department official called \"one of the most successful\" prosecutions of its kind.",
      "Spearman went by the nickname \"Boss\" and was labeled by the Justice Department as \"one of the most significant\" purveyors of child sex abuse material in the world. His arrest in 2022, his guilty plea a year later and his eventual life sentence were part of an unprecedented takedown of a prodigious child abuse network.",
      "Spearman is one of at least 18 people convicted so far of leading and utilizing the dark web to share hundreds of thousands of unlawful sexually exploitative images of children.\tThe Justice Department calls the investigation and prosecutions Operation Grayskull; it helped secure those arrests and shutter four heavily trafficked dark web sites where violent and horrific images of child sexual abuse were traded and housed.",
      "The Operation Grayskull investigation launched in 2020, when law enforcement agents noticed a spike in traffic to a dark web site suspected of hosting child abuse material. The dark web child abuse sites eventually attracted more than 120,000 members, millions of files and at least 100,000 visits in a single day, according to an FBI official who spoke with CBS News.",
      "\"Even for prosecutors, it is difficult to understand how pervasive this is,\" said Matthew Galeotti, head of the Justice Department Criminal Division.",
      "\"Because it happens on the dark web, people aren't aware of it. It's extremely troubling,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Spearman's case has parallels to many of the others unearthed by Operation Grayskull. Spearman was accused of helping lead a dark web site with thousands of users and members.\tA sentencing memo submitted to the court said it was \"no wonder\" that he had tried to resist the FBI, rather than surrendering.",
      "\"The devices at his desk contained massive quantities of evidence proving that he was the lead administrator of Website A,\" the memo said. \"Unsurprisingly, the defendant's devices also contained an enormous collection of images and videos depicting the rape and abuse of children.\"",
      "Selwyn Rosenstein was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2022, for\u00a0 operating a dark website for unlawful exploitative images. Prosecutors said the platform \"was not simply a website; it was a large, active community of pedophiles and (abuse material) enthusiasts. And it existed in part because of the Defendant's criminal acts.\"",
      "Rosenstein possessed such a large quantity of abusive images, he needed to store some on a server he used to run his business, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Speaking from a second floor conference room at Justice Department headquarters in Washington last week, Galeotti told CBS News the members of these dark web child abuse sites often \"earn\" membership by paying a fee, \"helping moderate the site\" or contributing child abuse images or material.",
      "Galeotti said, \"We luckily have very sophisticated prosecutors and agents who work specifically on this kind of thing. These are people who have a more of a technical understanding.\"",
      "\"The defendants in this case, as sadistic as they may be, are somewhat sophisticated,\" and make use of encryption, he added.",
      "Operation Grayskull also secured the conviction of Matthew Garrell of Raleigh, North Carolina, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for operating on a dark web site for abuse material.",
      "\"Garrell engaged in an extremely complex and technologically sophisticated conspiracy that far exceeds the typical child-exploitation offenses,\" prosecutors said.",
      "They argued in a court filing that Garrell possessed a predator's \"handbook,\" with \"detailed instructions\" for grooming children for future abuse.",
      "The takedown of dark web leaders and users also included the convictions of men from Virginia, Maryland, Indiana, Texas, Washington, Arkansas, Michigan and Oklahoma.",
      "\"They were part of an online community of hundreds of thousands of people, with leadership roles rules and a common dedicated purpose\" said Chris Delzotto, an acting FBI deputy assistant director. Delzotto told CBS News, \"Few people would have envisioned how (child abuse materials) would permeate the internet, the way it has today.\"",
      "The federal investigation which uncovered and shuttered the first dark web site, also led to the closure of three others. Abbigail Beccaccio, an FBI unit chief, told CBS News. \"The leadership team that operated one of the sites also operated several of the others.\"",
      "The Justice Department is touting the shutdown of those sites as a victory to help deter future abuse or production of unlawful images. \"This is one of the most successful of all time,\" Galeotti said. \"We dismantled four websites that have not regenerated.\"",

      "The task force, also known as the USPSTF, is a panel of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide insurance companies and doctors' decisions about a range of preventive health measures, like cancer and diabetes screenings as well as HIV and cholesterol drugs.",
      "In a letter posted on Sunday, the AMA \u2014 the largest association of physicians in the U.S. \u2014 addressed Kennedy over a report published Friday in The Wall Street Journal. The WSJ story cited sources familiar with the matter as saying Kennedy plans to dismiss the task force members because he views them as too \"woke.\"",
      "\"USPSTF plays a critical, non-partisan role in guiding physicians' efforts to prevent disease and improve the health of patients by helping to ensure access to evidence-based clinical preventive services,\" the AMA's letter said. \"As such, we urge you to retain the previously appointed members of the USPSTF and commit to the long-standing process of regular meetings to ensure their important work can continue without interruption.\"",

      "on how the USPSTF can better support HHS' mandate to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "The task force was created more than 40 years ago, but its work took on added significance after passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The law requires health insurers and group health plans to provide preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "In June, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the structure of the task force, but ruled that its members are \"inferior officers\" that can be \"removable at will\" by the HHS secretary. As the case played out, nonprofit organizations warned the Supreme Court that eliminating cost-sharing for services like breast cancer screenings or HIV-prevention medications would dissuade patients from seeking medical care.",
      "Last month, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practice, also known as ACIP, a separate government panel of that makes vaccine recommendations. He later named eight new advisers, including several allies he has worked with closely over the years and some members with a history as vaccine critics.",

    "summary": "Senate Democrats told the secretary of state they have \"grave concerns\" about the U.S. role in financing GHF, the main group distributing aid in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "A group of Democratic senators led by Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is urging the Trump administration to suspend American financial support for the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private food distribution organization that has been heavily criticized for the way it delivers food aid to Gazans and because so many have been killed trying to reach its distribution sites.",
      "The U.S. and Israel have advocated for the recently established GHF to replace the United Nations, which has built an extensive network of humanitarian workers inside Gaza over decades. Israel accuses the U.N. of bias and collusion with Hamas.",
      "In a letter sent to Secretary of State Marco Rubio Sunday, the 21 senators expressed \"grave\" concerns about \"the U.S. role in and financial support for the troubled GHF.\"",
      "\"We urge you to immediately cease all U.S. funding for GHF and resume support for the existing UN-led aid coordination mechanisms with enhanced oversight to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches civilians in need,\" the letter reads.",
      "The U.N. warns that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing increasingly dire as more Palestinians are in danger of starvation after a months-long Israeli blockade, and recent military operations complicated humanitarian efforts to help. The IDF claims there is no starvation.",
      "Van Hollen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as well as the powerful Appropriations Committee, told CBS News \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday, \"American taxpayers should not be spending one penny to fund this private organization backed by mercenaries and by the IDF that has become a death trap,\" noting that scores of Gazans were shot and killed as starving people crowded the GHF sites to obtain food.",
      "The letter focuses on a $30 million pledge from the State Department, announced last month, and on GHF's operations, particularly its use of armed contractors who stand behind IDF soldiers at food distribution sites in four designated military zones. Starving Gazans must travel to those areas, which is difficult for those too weak to move.",
      "\"Blurring the lines between delivery of aid and security operations shatters well-established norms that have governed distribution of humanitarian aid since the ratification of the Geneva Conventions in 1949,\" the letter says.",
      "U.S. allies have also been critical of the tactics used by the U.S. and Israeli-backed GHF.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot told Margaret Brennan Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" that Gaza is on the \"brink of food catastrophe\" and that France expects \"the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused [a] bloodbath in humanitarian health distribution lines in Gaza.\"",
      "U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Friday that a thousand Palestinians have been killed trying to access food since May 27.",
      "\"We hold video calls with our own humanitarians who are starving before our eyes,\" Guterres said. \"We will continue to speak out at every opportunity. But words don't feed hungry children.\"",
      "The U.N. human rights office said 1,054 people were killed while trying to obtain food since late May, and of those, 766 were killed while trying to reach sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The others were killed when gunfire erupted around U.N. convoys or aid sites.",
      "The group of senators led by Van Hollen are seeking answers about whether necessary oversight is being bypassed to benefit the GHF. Their letter cites public reports that the Trump administration authorized the funds under a \"priority directive,\" which meant it could avoid \"a comprehensive audit that is usually required for groups receiving USAID grants for the first time.\"",
      "The senators want to see the GHF's \"complete funding application and all supporting documentation\" and demand to know whether any statutory and regulatory requirements were waived.",
      "They also asked Rubio about the procurement mechanism that resulted in the $30 million in funding, and they want to know who signed the agreement, who might be liable for compliance violations and whether officials were aware of potential concerns raised by USAID about \"GHF's ability to protect Palestinians while delivering food aid.\"",
      "The State Department said it generally does not comment on congressional correspondence. A department spokesperson said Friday that the funding has been allocated, but it has not yet been disbursed to GHF.",
      "On Saturday, amid international outcry, the Israel Defense Force began airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza and said it would establish humanitarian corridors to \"enable the safe movement of UN convoys delivering food and medicine to the population.\"",
      "The U.N. has said the airdrops are insufficient. Past airdrops have fallen on Gazans and killed them. Now the approximately 2 million people live in Gaza and have been herded into an even more limited zone that lacks extensive open space where air-dropped pallets can land.",
      "Israel's announcement came after extensive international outcry at images of starving children, and reports of death. Leaders in Europe, including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Fredreich Merz, coordinated Saturday by phone. A readout of the call released by the UK said the three leaders said the situation in Gaza is \"appalling\" and \"emphasized the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire, for Israel to lift all restrictions on aid and urgently provide those suffering in Gaza with the food they so desperately need.\"",
      "On Friday, two Jordanian officials said they were considering airdrops and the United Arab Emirates sent a 7,000-ton aid ship to Gaza's shores. But it has not been determined who will distribute the food once it arrives.",
      "The GHF says it has distributed more than 91 million meals to Gazans, but there have been almost daily reports of civilians being injured or killed as they try to reach one of the group's four distribution hubs, all located in southern Gaza.",
      "In an interview with BBC News this week, Anthony Aguliar, a U.S. Army veteran and former contractor for GHF, detailed what he says he saw on the ground behind IDF lines during humanitarian aid distribution, calling the operation \"amateur.\"",
      "\"I witnessed the Israeli Defense Forces shooting at the crowds of Palestinians. I witnessed the Israeli Defense Forces firing a main gun tank round from the Merkava tank into a crowd of people,\" Aguilar said. \"In my most frank assessment, I would say that they're criminal. In my entire career, I have never witnessed the level of brutality and use of indiscriminate and unnecessary force against a civilian population, an unarmed, starving population.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the GHF called Aguilar's claims \"materially false\" and said he had been terminated from his position for \"misconduct.\"",
      "The group has also been criticized by the U.N., which said GHF's tactics are neither adequate nor safe and make it more difficult for Gazans too weak to travel to military zones to secure food.",
      "Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, which provides support for Palestinian refugees, condemned the GHF in June, calling it \"an abomination\" and \"a death trap costing more lives than it saves.\"",
      "As the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorated further this week, the GHF and U.N. groups continued to blame each other.",
      "In several public statements and social media posts last week, GHF said the responsibility for the mass starvation lies with the U.N. for allowing their full aid trucks inside Gaza to sit untouched and undistributed.",
      "\"The U.N. cannot deliver this humanitarian aid to the people who need it most, and I'm not sure what the reason is,\" said GHF spokesperson Chapin Fay in a video posted to X, which showed him standing in front of U.N. aid trucks. \"Whether it's looters, safety or whether they're playing politics, it just doesn't matter. The people of Gaza deserve better.\"",
      "The executive chairman of GHF, Reverend Johnnie Moore, in an interview with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro this week accused the U.N. of \"playing politics with people's lives.\"",
      "\"They're actually basically a willful participant on the Hamas side of the negotiating table in the ceasefire negotiations, by refusing to distribute aid and spreading this narrative around the world that the people of Gaza are going to starve if Hamas doesn't, in effect, get its demands at the negotiating table,\" Moore said.",
      "The U.N. World Food Programme says hundreds of aid trucks are ready to move, but the approval needed from the Israeli military to transport and distribute that aid is not coming quickly enough. In a statement Friday, they said just over half of their requests to collect cargo were approved and convoys were typically delayed, sometimes up to nearly two days, awaiting permission to travel within Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, a UNICEF spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that their supplies of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food or RUTF \u2014 used for treating severely acutely malnourished children \u2014 is expected to run out in mid-August if more is not allowed into Gaza.",

      "Oweis said UNICEF had only enough RUTF left to treat 3,000 children. In the first two weeks of July alone, UNICEF treated 5,000 children facing acute malnutrition in Gaza.",

      "According to Mr. Trump, the deal also includes that all European Union countries will be \"opened up for U.S. goods\" at 0% and the bloc will invest $600 billion in the U.S. The EU will also purchase $750 billion of U.S. energy as part of the deal.",
      "\"They are going to agree to invest into the United States $600 billion more than they're investing already,\" Mr. Trump said. \"So they're investing a large amount of money. You know what that amount of money is--It's very substantial.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department seeks to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, which requires U.S. immigration officials to hold migrant children in facilities that are safe and sanitary, among other protections.",
    "story": [
      "A child developed a rash after he was prevented from changing his underwear for four days. A little boy, bored and overcome with despair, began hitting himself in the head. A child with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was forced to go without his medication, despite his mother's pleas.",
      "\"I heard one officer say about us 'they smell like sh--,'\" one detained person recounted in a federal court filing. \"And another officer responded, 'They are sh--.'\"",
      "Attorneys for immigrant children collected these stories, and more, from youth and families detained in what they called \"prison-like\" settings across the U.S. from March through June, even as the Trump administration has requested a federal district court judge terminate existing protections that mandate basic rights and services \u2014 including safe and sanitary conditions \u2014 for children held by the government.",
      "The administration argues that the protections mandated under what is known as the Flores Settlement Agreement encourage immigration and interfere with its ability to establish immigration policy. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, who is in California, is expected to issue a ruling on the request after an Aug. 8 hearing.",
      "With the Flores agreement in place, children are being held in \"unsafe and unsanitary\" U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities such as tents, airports, and offices for up to several weeks despite the agency's written policy saying people generally should not be held in its custody longer than 72 hours, according to the June court filing from immigrants' attorneys. In addition to opposing the U.S. Department of Justice's May request to terminate the Flores consent decree, the attorneys demanded more monitoring for children in immigration detention.",
      "\"The biggest fear is that without Flores, we will lose a crucial line of transparency and accountability,\" said Sergio Perez, executive director of the California-based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. \"Then you have a perfect storm for the abuse of individuals, the violation of their rights, and the kind of treatment that this country doesn't stand for.\"",
      "The Flores agreement has set minimum standards and oversight for detained immigrant children since 1997, when it brought an end to a decade-long lawsuit filed on behalf of unaccompanied immigrant minors who had been subjected to poor treatment in unsafe and unsanitary conditions without access to medical care. It is named for Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old from El Salvador who was taken into U.S. custody in the mid-1980s, subjected to strip searches, and housed alongside unrelated men.",
      "The agreement established national standards for the protection of immigrant children detained by federal authorities, with requirements for safe and sanitary detention facilities, access to clean water, appropriate food, clothing, bedding, recreational and educational opportunities, sanitation, plus appropriate medical and mental health care. Children in immigrant detention range from infants to teens.",
      "In 2015, Gee ruled that the agreement includes children accompanied by adults.",
      "The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which includes both the Customs and Border Protection agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the administration's intent to end the Flores agreement or about the conditions in which kids are detained. In a May court filing, government attorneys argued, among other points, that the agreement improperly directs immigration decisions to the courts, not the White House. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also has said that the Flores agreement has \"incentivized illegal immigration,\" and that Congress and federal agencies have resolved the problems Flores was designed to fix.",
      "ICE detention facilities have the \"highest standards,\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in an email to KFF Health News. \"They are safe, clean, and hold illegal aliens who are awaiting final removal proceedings.\"",
      "Immigration lawyers and researchers have pushed back on the idea that the Flores agreement encourages migration, arguing that the conditions in people's homelands are driving them to move.",
      "President Trump is not the first president to seek to modify, or end, the agreement.",
      "In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration unsuccessfully sought to exempt accompanied minors from the Flores agreement, arguing that an influx of immigrants from Central America had overwhelmed the system.",
      "In 2019, following a policy that caused family separation, the first Trump administration announced it would replace Flores with new regulations to expand family detention and eliminate detention time limits. The courts rejected that plan, too.",
      "In 2024, President Joe Biden's administration successfully requested to remove the Department of Health and Human Services from the agreement after the Office of Refugee Resettlement incorporated some Flores standards into agency regulations.",
      "Allegations of unsafe conditions under the agreement also predate this latest immigration crackdown under Mr. Trump. One court filing from 2019 said that attorneys visiting two Texas detention centers found at least 250 infants, children, and teens, some of whom had been held at the facility for nearly a month. \"Children were filthy and wearing clothes covered in bodily fluids, including urine,\" the filing said.",
      "Seven children are known to have died while in federal custody from 2018 to 2019, according to media reports.",
      "And in 2023, 8-year-old Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez became sick and died while in Customs and Border Protection custody in Texas for nine days. Her parents had turned over medical records detailing the girl's medical history, including diagnoses of sickle cell disease and congenital heart disease, upon their detention. Yet her mother's repeated pleas for emergency medical care were ignored.",
      "Her family filed a wrongful death claim in May.",
      "Advocates attributed the deaths partly to prolonged detention in increasingly crowded facilities and delayed medical care. Officials have said they increased\u00a0medical services and acknowledged failures in the wake of the deaths.",
      "But with the Trump administration's unprecedented push to detain and deport migrants \u2014 including families \u2014 the threat to the health of children caught up in those sweeps is alarming child advocates.",
      "\"Very rarely do you have spikes in populations of detained folk that you don't see a drastic decrease in the quality of their medical care,\" said Daniel Hatoum, a senior supervising attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, one of the groups that filed the wrongful death claim for Anadith's family.",
      "Recent reports from court-appointed monitors cite continued lack of access to appropriate medical care; temperature extremes; few outside recreational opportunities; lack of appropriate food and clothing; and an inability to dim lights to sleep.",
      "Terminating the Flores agreement would remove all outside oversight of immigration detention facilities by court-ordered monitors and attorneys. The public would have to depend on the government for transparency about the conditions in which children are held.",
      "\"Our system requires that there be some oversight for government, not just the Department of Homeland Security, but in general,\" Hatoum said. \"We know that. So, I do not believe that DHS could police itself.\"",
      "In the months after Mr. Trump took office and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency began cuts, the administration shuttered DHS' Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which were intended to add a layer of oversight. After a lawsuit, the Trump administration reversed action and noted the offices would remain open, but it is unclear how those offices have been affected by shifts in policy and cuts in staffing.",
      "Leecia Welch, an attorney with the legal advocacy group Children's Rights, said the Flores agreement itself, or efforts to hold the government responsible for abiding by its requirements, are not rooted in partisan politics. She said she raised concerns about conditions during Biden's administration, too.",
      "\"These are not political issues for me,\" Welch said. \"How does our country want to treat children? That's it. It's very simple. I'm not going to take it easy on any administration where children are being harmed in their care.\"",

    "summary": "Project 2025 lays out an overhaul of the Fed, saying \"Congress should limit its mandate to the sole objective of stable money.\"",
    "story": [
      "White House budget official Russell Vought, one of the authors of Project 2025, indicated Sunday that President Trump's focus on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is because the president wants lower interest rates, not because it is one of the mentioned targets of an overhaul in the conservative blueprint.",
      "\"I don't even know what that chapter says,\" Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" when talking about Project 2025 and the Federal Reserve. \"All I know, in terms of the president, the president has run on an agenda. He's been very clear about that.\"",
      "Overseen by the conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was a massive, multi-prong initiative for how a Republican president can introduce sweeping right-wing policy. Mr. Trump insisted on the campaign trail that he had \"nothing to do\" with Project 2025, and a 2024 CBS News analysis found that at least 270 of the nearly 700 policy proposals matched either campaign proposals or his first-term agenda. Since he took office, many of his policies have matched ones laid out in Project 2025.",
      "Project 2025 lays out an overhaul of the Fed, saying \"monetary dysfunction is related in part to the impossibility of fine-tuning the money supply in real time, as well as to the moral hazard inherent in a political system that has demonstrated a history of bailing out private firms when they engage in excess speculation.\"",
      "\"To protect the Federal Reserve's independence and to improve monetary policy outcomes, Congress should limit its mandate to the sole objective of stable money.\" Project 2025 says. Vought is not listed as one of the\u00a0 authors of that chapter, but he was one of the key intellectual drivers of the overall project and its recommendations.",
      "In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has sharply criticized Powell and has indicated he wants to fire Powell, but Mr. Trump has also said he didn't think it was necessary. The Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" and Mr. Trump has zeroed in on an extensive renovation project to two of the Federal Reserve's buildings under Powell's watch. Vought sent a letter on July 10 to Powell alleging the \"ostentatious\" office renovation project may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump visited the Fed on Thursday, where he and Powell clashed over the cost of those changes. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces. The Fed is self-funded, so taxpayer dollars are not appropriated for their costs.",
      "Powell's term is up in 2026, and House Speaker Mike Johnson told CBS News last week that he expects a \"rocky road\" ahead for Powell.",
      "Mr. Trump wants Powell to lower interest rates, but Powell has said the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs, which Powell says could push up inflation. Further, the decision to raise or lower interest rates is not Powell's alone \u2014 eight times a year, the Federal Open Market Committee, which has 12 members, votes on monetary policy.",
      "Despite the pressure from the Trump administration, the Fed is expected to hold steady on interest rates at its meeting this week.",
      "Vought said Sunday that Mr. Trump has been \"very clear that all he's asking from the Fed is lower interest rates, because he thinks it's important.\"",
      "\"When you look across the globe, and you have countries lowering rates, and yet we don't see that in this country, given all of the positive economic indicators that we're seeing,\" Vought said. \"And then we have fiscal mismanagement at the Fed with regard to this building renovation that I'm sure you will ask me about. Those are the kinds of things that we want to see from the Fed. This is not part of an existential issue with regard to the Federal Reserve.\"",

    "story": [
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe \"strongly supports the public release\" this week of highly sensitive documents by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, according to a CIA spokesperson, who said Ratcliffe \"initiated\" the declassification process after he took the helm at the agency this year.",
      "Gabbard's office publicly released a report drafted in 2017 by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee on Russian activity during the 2016 election, sparking concerns about risks to sensitive sources and methods. She said Wednesday that the document contained additional evidence that Obama administration officials \"manufactured\" a narrative about Russia's actions that was designed to undercut President Trump.",
      "Gabbard also declassified a swath of documents related to the 2016 election last Friday.",
      "\"CIA Director Ratcliffe strongly supports the public release of HPSCI's report, which was the result of a process initiated by CIA and led by DNI Gabbard,\" the CIA spokesperson said, using an abbreviation for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.",
      "\"This effort reflects Director Ratcliffe's continued commitment to elevating the truth and bringing transparency to the American people and would not have been possible without his directive to return it to the committee,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The House report, which the committee's Republican staff finalized in December 2017 but updated through 2020, was so highly classified that it was stored at CIA headquarters before Ratcliffe sent it back to the House panel and ultimately toward public release, CBS News has learned.",
      "The committee made it available to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, according to an ODNI official with knowledge of the declassification process. Gabbard would normally have been required to consult with the intelligence agencies that had contributed sensitive information to the report before declassifying it, but Mr. Trump \u2014 who made the decision to declassify the document with relatively few redactions \u2014 was not under the same obligations, the official said.",
      "The report was the result of one of multiple investigations related to the 2016 election that the committee undertook at a time when Kash Patel, now the FBI director, was a senior staffer. It contained discussions about raw intelligence from a CIA source the agency had recruited in Russia, and questioned whether analysts had sufficiently taken into account the source's motivations, proximity to Putin or potential bias towards Mr. Trump.",
      "The CIA source's information helped inform the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment, or ICA, which concluded in part that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government aspired to help then-candidate Donald Trump's election chances by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. The U.S. exfiltrated a CIA asset from Russia in 2017, CBS News previously confirmed.",
      "That judgment within the ICA has vexed Mr. Trump for years and has been a key focus of Gabbard's recent declassifications.",
      "Gabbard has claimed the documents released by her office reveal a \"treasonous conspiracy\" by Obama-era officials to undermine Mr. Trump during his first term by alleging Russian efforts to help him win in 2016. Gabbard says she has forwarded the records to the Justice Department as part of a criminal referral.",
      "Obama's spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush called Gabbard's accusations \"bizarre\" and \"ridiculous\" earlier this week.",
      "The ICA's judgement about Russian actions in 2016 was also the focus of a recent CIA internal review under Ratcliffe. Released earlier this month, that review contained far fewer of the sensitive details included in the House Republicans' report and said the judgment on Putin's preference for Trump should have been issued with moderate rather than high confidence. But it said it did not dispute the \"quality and credibility\" of the information.",
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark Warner, called the release of the House committee's report by Gabbard \"desperate and irresponsible.\" He said it put highly sensitive sources at risk and could disincentivize potential spies from working for the U.S. government.",
      "\"Tell me how you're going to recruit somebody to, in one of our adversarial nations, maybe work with us, if that information is carelessly thrown around,\" Warner said to reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Ratcliffe, who previously served on the House Intelligence Committee as a congressman from Texas, has said one of his primary objectives as CIA director would be to reinvigorate intelligence collection from human sources. Current and former national security officials have said intelligence provided by human sources, known as HUMINT, has dropped off in recent years, as surveillance technologies have become more sophisticated and ubiquitous.",
      "Human sources \u2014 especially those with proximity to world leaders in adversarial countries like Russia, China and North Korea \u2014 are especially prized and especially rare, given how risky, if not life-threatening, it can be for them to provide information to a foreign intelligence agency. Information provided by human sources typically remains classified for decades, often up to 75 years, according to government classification rules.",
      "At his Senate confirmation hearing in January, Ratcliffe said the recruitment of human spies by the CIA is \"not where it needs to be.\"",
      "\"I do want to spend time looking at that,\" he said.",

      "New York City \u2014 George Pappas, Jennifer Peyton and Carla Espinoza were all federal immigration judges fired this month by email. The three ruled on thousands of immigration cases in Chicago and Boston.",
      "\"It was arbitrary, unfair,\" Pappas told CBS News of his firing. \"And it's an attack on the rule of law. It's an attack on judges.\"",
      "Pappas served as an immigration judge in Boston until this week, overseeing more than 2,000 cases during his two years on the bench. Peyton led Chicago's immigration court for nearly nine years, hearing thousands of cases until she was abruptly fired over the 4th of July weekend.",
      "Peyton oversaw Espinoza, who was appointed in 2023 and decided more than 1,000 cases in the last fiscal year, double the average for immigration judges.",
      "Peyton told CBS News she received no reason for her firing. Immigration judges are under the authority of the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review.",
      "\"My email was three sentences,\" Peyton said. \"I had no cause. I had no explanation.\"",
      "\"We as judges, were in fear, we were concerned,\" Espinoza added. \"That makes it very difficult to be impartial. We were not succumbing to that pressure but it does feel like pressure.\"",
      "Both Pappas and Peyton disclosed that they were told how they should rule on immigration cases.",
      "\"They told me: Grant the motions to dismiss,\" Pappas said. \"This is when ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) was roaming the courthouses. Because if we dismissed the case, that person that responded then leaves the court vulnerable to immediate apprehension and expedited removal.\"",
      "CBS News has reported on the numerous cases where ICE agents detained immigrants as they exited their court hearings.",
      "\"Once they left the courtroom, more often than not, they would be handcuffed and led away by the ICE officers,' Peyton added.",
      "According to the Executive Office for Immigration Review,  Federal immigration courts now face a backlog nearing four million cases, with about 600 judges left to hear those cases.",
      "The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, the union that represents immigration court judges, reports that since the Trump Administration took office, more than 100 immigration\u00a0 judges have either been fired, transferred, or have taken retirement offers.",
      "According to the union, immigration judges are considered Justice Department employees, and therefore do not have lifetime appointments like federal judges in the judicial branch.",
      "In a Truth Social post\u00a0in April, President Trump argued that, \"We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years.\"",
      "It is my opinion that this administration could give a hoot about the backlog,\" Pappas said.",
      "In defending its immigration crackdown, the White House has repeatedly argued that undocumented immigrants are in the U.S. illegally. And in May, the Trump administration began an effort to halt the immigration court cases of certain migrants in order to fast-track their deportation process, government officials and attorneys told CBS News at the time. Espinoza counters that the court system exists to ensure the law is followed, and attempts to circumvent it could prove to be a slippery slope.",
      "\"That's why they're in proceedings in court,\" Espinoza said of the immigrants. \"There is law that we're applying, and they might have to go, and they might not...Today it's them, it's immigrants. What about tomorrow? Who's going to get due process denied next.\"",
      "\"If you're attacking the very judges that adjudicate cases, there's not going to be a rule of law. That should concern everybody, not just immigrants, but U.S. citizens.\"",
      "When reached by CBS News, the Justice Department had no comment on the union's allegations that several immigration judges had been fired without cause.",
      "And in response to claims from former judges that the firings are a targeted attack on immigration courts, the Justice Department said, \"To the contrary, the Trump Administration is vigorously enforcing our nation's immigration laws.\"",

    "summary": "In a new survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends.",
    "story": [
      "No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence.",
      "The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party.",
      "The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship.",
      "\"Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,\" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. \"I think kids use AI to get out of thinking.\"",
      "For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you.\"",
      "More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to\u00a0a new study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly.",
      "The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as \"digital friends,\" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say.",
      "In an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are \"everywhere in teens' lives.\"",
      "Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships.",
      "\"Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,\" Steyer said. \"They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings.\"",
      "As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health.",
      "\"AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,\" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. \"When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified.\"",
      "All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an \"AI companion\" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship.",
      "\"That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,\" said Nair. \"It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people.\"",
      "How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers",
      "In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were \"as satisfying or more satisfying\" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people.",
      "Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are.",
      "\"It's eye-opening,\" said Robb. \"When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions.\" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May.",
      "Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement \u2014 not replace \u2014 real-world interactions.",
      "\"If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,\" he said.",
      "When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both.",
      "\"It's a challenge with how kids live today because they spend so many hours in front of a screen, and when you substitute a machine or a robot for human interaction, you're fundamentally changing the nature of that relationship,\" Steyer told CBS News.",
      "The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a \"risk assessment,\" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions.",
      "\"In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,\" Steyer said.",
      "A concerning trend to teens and adults alike",
      "Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot.",
      "\"Parents really have no idea this is happening,\" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up.\" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data.",
      "Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults.",
      "Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations.",
      "\"One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,\" said Telzer. \"They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not.\"",
      "Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class.",
      "\"If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,\" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster.",
      "Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger.",
      "\"I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,\" Perry said. \"I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend.\"",
      "Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media.",
      "\"Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,\" Nair said. \"I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper \u2014 our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that.\"",
      "\"It's the new addiction,\" Nair added. \"That's how I see it.\"",

    "summary": "Along with launching two NASA probes, the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carried five other satellites into orbit with goals ranging from basic science to technology development.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched twin satellites for NASA Wednesday that will study how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field, creating constantly changing and occasionally dangerous \"space weather\" affecting satellites, electrical grids and other critical systems.",
      "The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, \"the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,\" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division.",
      "\"What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space.",
      "\"It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth.\"",
      "Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new \"polylingual\" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols.",
      "Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the \"radiation budget,\" and another that will focus on how high-energy \"killer electrons\" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere.",
      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",
      "The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols.",
      "The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs.",
      "Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space.",
      "Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites.",
      "The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator.",
      "\"The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,\" she said. \"These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction.\"",
      "The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, \"it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them.\"",
      "What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which \"could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.\"",

    "story": [
      "AI gets a lot of attention for eliminating human jobs, but more and more it is also creating them.",
      "The number of job postings that mention artificial intelligence has climbed in recent years as employers seek workers versed in AI, a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from the Brookings Institution shows, In the last year alone, AI-themed job postings increased by over 100%, the Washington, D.C.-based think tank found.",
      "AI-related job postings have grown at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the last 15 years \u2014 that outstrips the 11% rate of postings in the general economy, said Brookings, which based its findings on data from labor market analytics firm Lightcast.",
      "Demand for AI expertise is growing as more companies start to integrate AI into their workflows. The share of companies using AI in the manufacturing sector has more than doubled from 4% in early 2023 to roughly 9% as of mid-2025, according to Brookings, citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS).",
      "Yet while AI job growth has accelerated in recent years, it makes up only a small fraction of the labor market overall. Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the peak pace of adoption will hit in the early 2030s.",
      "\"AI is definitely visible in the micro labor market data, but it doesn't look like it's driving the overall labor market dynamic,\" said Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs.",

      "AI positions may prove an especially appealing sector of the U.S. labor market given that they tend to be associated with higher salaries. Job postings that mention AI skills pay an average of $18,000, or 28%, more per year than for similar roles that don't require AI skills, according to a separate report from Lightcast.",
      "Where are AI jobs to be found?",
      "Unsurprisingly, AI job growth tends to be concentrated in tech hubs like Silicon Valley, which accounts for 13% of all AI-related job postings. Seattle accounts for 7% according to data from Lightcast.",
      "But AI jobs are starting to surface in other parts of the country including the Sunbelt and along the East Coast between Boston and Washington, D.C. said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro. Universities have also been a catalyst for AI job growth, he noted.",
      "Magrini noted that AI skills are increasingly required in other non-tech fields like marketing, human resources and finance. Over half of job postings requesting AI skills in 2024 were outside IT and computer science, according to Lightcast data.",
      "While uptake is uneven across geographic areas, Muro said he expects AI adoption by employers to increase more rapidly in the coming years as they figure out its benefits and limitations.",
      "\"There does seem to be good consensus that this is very important for productivity and that it does really energize regional leaders and business people,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Jul 2025 15:42:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Automated license plate reader technology is used by law enforcement agencies in communities across the U.S. \u2014 but the systems sometimes get things wrong.",
    "story": [
      "In 2018, Brian Hofer and his younger brother were driving to visit their parents for Thanksgiving. It should have been a routine trip.",
      "But that evening they found themselves held at gunpoint by a group of law enforcement officers.",
      "The incident was the result of technology gone wrong. Hofer's vehicle had been flagged as stolen by an Automated License Plate Reader \u2014 ALPR \u2014 system. When he drove by, the reader alerted authorities.",
      "\"Your life definitely is different after you have guns pointed at you,\" he said.",
      "This incident is one of over a dozen cases verified by CBS News during a six-month investigation into incidents of wrongful stops and even several instances of ALPR technology being abused.",
      "The consequences of ALPR errors can range from the inconvenient \u2014 such as mistaken toll booth charges \u2014 to the potentially dangerous, such as Hofer's armed detainment. In some instances the technology was improperly used by authorities, such as in Kansas, where law enforcement officers used license plate reader systems to stalk former partners in two separate incidents.",
      "The rise of ALPR systems",
      "In use since at least the\u00a0late 1990s, automated license plate reader systems have advanced quickly in recent years. They now marry high-speed, high-resolution cameras with artificial intelligence to scan every license plate passing through a designated field of vision. The data is then compared against license plate numbers in databases.",
      "Thousands of agencies use these systems daily to scan plates in real time and identify potential matches. Departments use ALPRs as a crime-fighting tool to gather evidence for investigations and reduce crime as well as for traffic compliance.",
      "According to a survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, every police department overseeing more than 1 million citizens reported using the technology, as did 90% of sheriff's offices with 500 or more sworn deputies.",
      "Law enforcement officials told CBS News that the technology has allowed them to do their job more efficiently and has helped solve crimes ranging from stolen vehicles to missing persons cases.",
      "Pat Yoes, the national president of The National Fraternal Order of Police, an organization of hundreds of thousands of sworn law enforcement officers, said in an emailed statement to CBS News that ALPRs are \"extraordinarily important in cases where there is an immediate threat to life or safety, as in an abduction or an armed threat driving to a target,\" adding that the information can be valuable in generating leads and closing cases.",
      "He said transparency is key. \"The community should be made aware of the new technology, how it's used in the field, how it contributes to public safety, and how it addresses any privacy concerns,\" he said in the statement. \"Technology like ALPRs is a valuable tool for many law enforcement agencies to make their communities safer.\"",
      "The rise of ALPR systems comes as law enforcement agencies across the country face staffing and recruiting challenges. A 2024 survey by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, a professional association, found that U.S. agencies are operating at a nearly 10% staffing deficit. ALPR technology is one way to help fill this gap in manpower.",
      "Why license plate readers make errors \u2014 what we found",
      "License plate reader errors may occur for a variety of reasons. In some cases, letters or numbers are interpreted incorrectly by the Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, software. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, common issues including glare or misaligned cameras could impact accuracy. CBS News found that mistakes are often due to a mix of machine and human or administrative errors.",
      "In Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico, a 12-year-old was handcuffed after an ALPR camera misread the last number of a license plate on a vehicle driven by her older sister as a \"7\" instead of the \"2\" it actually ended with, according to a lawsuit filed against the city. A month later, in a separate incident, a 17-year-old honors student was held at gunpoint in Espa\u00f1ola on his way home from school after officers mistook his vehicle for one associated with an individual who was being sought in connection with a string of armed robberies.",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, in 2020, a mother and her family, including her 6-year-old daughter, were pulled over at gunpoint and forced to lie face down on hot pavement. Again, ALPR technology was central to the stop. Police mistakenly flagged their Colorado license plate as matching that of a completely different vehicle from a different state \u2014 a stolen motorcycle registered in Montana. The incident, captured on video and widely condemned, led to a $1.9 million settlement from the city in 2024.",
      "Privacy and accuracy concerns",
      "The ACLU warns ALPR cameras could infringe on civil rights and violate the Constitution's Fourth Amendment by encouraging unreasonable searches. Despite widespread use, there is no federal legislative framework for ALPR use.",
      "Hofer, who has been involved in privacy advocacy for over a decade, is now the executive director of Secure Justice, an organization that aims to reduce government and corporate overreach. He says manual verification is necessary to see whether ALPR \"hits,\" or matches, are accurate. Even so, he said, such checks are insufficient because data errors could cause a plate to \"match\" an incorrect entry in a database.",
      "\"There are billions of scans a day in America. If there's even just a 10% error rate, that means there are so many opportunities for abuse to happen,\" Hofer said.",
      "Some concerned citizens are taking action. Last year, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, filed a federal lawsuit against the city, and in Illinois, two residents have sued the Illinois State Police over ALPR systems, arguing that their use violates Fourth Amendment rights. The latter case was dismissed without prejudice in April.",

    "summary": "Along with launching two NASA probes, the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carried five other satellites into orbit with goals ranging from basic science to technology development.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched twin satellites for NASA Wednesday that will study how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field, creating constantly changing and occasionally dangerous \"space weather\" affecting satellites, electrical grids and other critical systems.",
      "The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, \"the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,\" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division.",
      "\"What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space.",
      "\"It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth.\"",
      "Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new \"polylingual\" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols.",
      "Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the \"radiation budget,\" and another that will focus on how high-energy \"killer electrons\" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere.",
      "Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental \"cubesat\" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world.",
      "The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg.",
      "The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad.",
      "A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch.",
      "Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later.",
      "TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind \"couples\" with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,\" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa.",
      "\"And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.\"",
      "That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays, \"but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that.\"",
      "\"So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,\" Miles said.",
      "The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols.",
      "The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs.",
      "Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space.",
      "Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites.",
      "The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator.",
      "\"The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,\" she said. \"These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction.\"",
      "The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, \"it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them.\"",
      "What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which \"could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.\"",

I came out five minutes later (and) one of my co-workers came out and he said he saw two people get shot, and five minutes after that another one of our co-workers came out and said he saw two police officers trying to go up to the elevator banks that go to the higher floors.\"",
      "A woman who also works in the area told CBS News New York, \"We rushed the window in the direction where the helicopters are going, and then, we look and there's cop cars everywhere, and then someone pulls up Twitter and we find out that there is an active shooter.\"",
      "The building houses the headquarters of the NFL and Blackstone, one of the world's largest investment firms, and has numerous other well-known tenants.",

      "Jacob Stern, who works in one of them, told CBS News New York, \"The building personnel said, 'Stay in place, there's an active shooter, don't leave, get away from the windows.' Your adrenaline rushes and, you know, it's pretty scary when the building says 'don't go by the windows.'\"",
      "A number of tourists kept asking what had happened as they walked by and darted off with looks of concern when they learned there'd been a shooting.",
      "Two Blackstone employees in white-collared shirts and dress pants stood on a corner making calls and seemed relieved when they were told not to come in to work Tuesday.",

      "Nekeisha Lewis was eating dinner with friends on the nearby plaza when she heard gunfire. \"It felt like it was a quick two shots and then it was rapid fire,\" she told the AP. Windows shattered and a man ran from the building saying, \"Help, help. I'm shot.\" Lewis said.",

      "The suspect, identified as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.",
      "NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch said surveillance video shows the suspect exiting a double-parked black BMW alone on Park Avenue between 51st and 52nd streets just before 6:30 p.m., carrying an M4 rifle in his right hand. He then entered the 44-story building at 345 Park Ave., turned right and immediately began opening fire on an NYPD officer.",
      "Not long after, multiple 911 calls were received about an active shooter inside the building, Tisch said.",
      "NYPD Officer Didarul Islam killed in shooting",
      "Didarul Islam, 36, worked out of the 47th Precinct in the Bronx. A four-year veteran of the force, Didarul was on a paid detail Monday as part of a program the NYPD has that allows officers to be employed by private companies to provide extra security, CBS News New York's Naveen Dhaliwal reported.",
      "Didarul leaves behind a pregnant wife and two young sons, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said at a late-night news conference.",
      "\"He was doing what he does best, and all members of the police department carry out. He was saving lives. He was protecting New Yorkers,\" Adams said. \"He was an immigrant from Bangladesh and he loved this city. And everyone we spoke with stated he was a person of faith and a person that believed in God and believed in living out the life of a godly person. He embodies what this city is all about. He's a true-blue New Yorker, not only in a uniform he wore but in his spirit and energy of loving this city.\"",
      "Adams said two men and a woman were also killed in the shooting and another man is in critical condition. The mayor called the shooting \"a violent, despicable attack,\" adding, \"No words can describe this act of evil, a man who takes the life of others who are innocent. And no words can fill the void left by this tragedy.\"",
      "The building contains offices for Blackstone, the NFL, KPMG and others.",
      "An NFL employee was seriously wounded and was hospitalized in stable condition, according to a message NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sent to NFL employees. It wasn't clear whether that person was the one Adams said earlier was in critical condition.",
      "Adams said he met with Islam's family earlier in the evening and told them how much he was admired for putting his life on the line.",
      "\"This was his dad's only son. I think about Jordan, my child, and it is unimaginable to experience a loss of this magnitude,\" the mayor said.",

      "After shooting the officer, the gunman shot a woman who had taken shelter behind a pillar and then proceeded through the lobby, spraying it with gunfire, officials said.",
      "He then made his way to the elevator bank, shooting a security guard who had taken cover behind the security desk. Another man who was wounded told police at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital he was shot in the lobby, Tisch said.",
      "The police commssioner said at one point the gunman was waiting for an elevator to arrive, and when it did, a woman emerged, but he allowed her to walk by unharmed. The gunman then took the elevator to the 33rd floor, the site of Rudin Management, and \"began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled.\" Tisch said one of the victims was shot and killed on that floor.",
      "\"He then proceeds down the hallway and shoots himself in the chest,\" Tisch said.",
      "What police know about gunman Shane Tamura",
      "Tisch said the vehicle Tamura exited on Park Avenue was registered to him. Inside, officers found a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack and medication prescribed to Tamura. No explosives were found.",
      "The commissioner said preliminary findings show Tamura drove the vehicle across the country to get to New York City, traveling through Colorado on Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday, and passing through Columbia, New Jersey, at 4:24 p.m. on Monday.",
      "According to law enforcement in Las Vegas, Tamura had a documented mental health history, Tisch said.",
      "His motive remains under investigation. Tisch said investigators are working to figure out why he targeted 345 Park Ave. specifically.",
      "After reports of the shooting, the building was placed on lockdown and the area was blocked off, police said.",
      "The NYPD and Mayor Adams asked the public to avoid the vicinity of East 52nd Street between Park Avenue and Lexington Avenue. Tisch said officers from the NYPD's Special Operations Division were conducting a secondary sweep of the building.",
      "\"I want to be very clear: We believe this to be a lone shooter and there is no longer an active threat to the public,\" Tisch said.",
      "\"Pure evil came to the heart of our city.\"",

      "\"This is a devastating night for our city, for our police department,\" Hendry said. \"Pure evil came to the heart of our city and struck innocent people and one of our police officers who was protecting those people. We lost four people tonight, and our hero brother, who gave his life for this city. He was a hard-working police officer who was proud, we know from hearing from his family, to put on that shield and the uniform of a New York City police officer. Every day he went out and did his job.\"",

      "Hall of Fame Chicago Cubs slugger and second baseman Ryne Sandberg has died, following a battle with prostate cancer.",
      "Sandberg died Monday, July 28, the Cubs confirmed. He was 65 years old.",
      "\"Ryne Sandberg was a hero to a generation of Chicago Cubs fans and will be remembered as one of the all-time greats in nearly 150 years of this historic franchise,\" Cubs executive chairman Tom Ricketts said in a statement. \"His dedication to and respect for the game, along with his unrelenting integrity, grit, hustle, and competitive fire were hallmarks of his career. He was immensely proud of his teammates and his role as a global ambassador of the game of baseball, but most of all, he was proud of Margaret, his children and his role as husband, father, and grandfather.\"",
      "Sandberg played in parts of 16 big-league seasons, almost entirely with the Cubs.",
      "Sandberg was born Sept. 18, 1959, in Spokane, Washington. He was the youngest of four children of Derwent \"Sandy\" Sandberg, a mortician, and Elizabeth \"Libby\" Sandberg, a nurse, according to the Society for American Baseball Research.",
      "Sandberg's parents named him for New York Yankees pitcher Ryne Duren, the society reported.",
      "At North Central High School in Spokane, Sandberg was a standout in baseball, as well as football and basketball, the society noted, citing local newspaper reports. He received All-America Team honors from Parade Magazine as a quarterback and punter on the school's football team, and received second-team Greater Spokane League basketball honors his junior and senior years, the society reported.",
      "On the basketball court, John Stockton, later of the Utah Jazz, was a rival of Sandberg's from Gonzaga Prep High School, the society reported.",
      "But of course, it was the baseball diamond that turned out to be Sandberg's calling. In high school, Sandberg made the All-City team twice, hitting .417 with four home runs and helped lead his high school team to a 25-3 record and a second-place finish in the state tournament championship.",
      "Major League Baseball scouts already had their eyes on Sandberg when he signed a letter of intent to go to Washington State University on a football scholarship, the society noted. While this was enough to make most scouts lose interest, scouts for the Philadelphia Phillies kept wooing Sandberg, and he ended up choosing baseball over football.",
      "The Phillies drafted Sandberg in 1978 in the 20th round. He played in the minor leagues first with the Pioneer League in Helena, Montana, and then with Class A Spartanburg in the Western Carolinas League in 1979, the society noted.",
      "Sandberg advanced to Double-A Reading in 1980 and made the Eastern League All-Star Team. He played in Triple-A Oklahoma City in 1981, before the Phillies called him up to the majors late that season.",
      "Following the 1981 season, the Phillies and Cubs exchanged shortstops \u2014 Larry Bowa came to the Cubs in exchange for Iv\u00e1n DeJesus \u2014 but Cubs general manager Dallas Green wanted Sandberg too,\u00a0according to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "In his first season with the Cubs in 1982, Sandberg played third base and hit .271 with 33 doubles and 32 stolen bases. According to the Baseball Hall of Fame, he finished sixth in the National League Rookie of the Year voting.",
      "Sandberg was switched to second base for the 1983 season \u2014 which the Cubs finished with a record of 71-91, and which is best remembered today for a tirade by manager Lee Elia directed at disrespectful fans. But Sandberg won the first of nine straight Gold Glove Awards that year, the Baseball Hall of Fame noted.",
      "In 1984, Jim Frey replaced Elia as the Cubs' manager. Sandberg was a starter for the Cubs alongside other legends such as Jody Davis, Leon Durham, and Keith Moreland.",
      "When the Cubs took on the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field\u00a0on June 23, 1984, Sandberg kept driving in runs to overcome an early 7-1 Cubs deficit. But the Cubs were still down 9-8 as the bottom of the ninth began \u2014   only for Sandberg to hit a homer and tie it up.",
      "The Cubs did not score again in the bottom of the ninth, and the game went into extra innings. St. Louis scored two more runs in the top of the 10th and took an 11-9 lead, but with two out and no one on base, Bob Dernier worked a walk from ex-Cub Bruce Sutter \u2014  and Sandberg hit another homer to tie the game at 11, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "The Cubs scored one more time on an RBI single by Dave Owen \u2014   and won 12-11. The game became known as the \"Ryne Sandberg Game\" and propelled the 1984 Cubs toward success that season.",
      "\"This is something that might be a once-in-a-lifetime thing,\" Sandberg said at the time. \"Besides being in shock right now, it was a lot of fun.\"",
      "The Cubs won the National League Eastern Division championship in '84 \u2013 for their first appearance in the postseason since the 1945 World Series.",
      "While the Cubs lost the 1984 National League Championship Series 3-2, Sandberg won the National League Most Valuable Player award and made the All-Star roster for the first of 10 times. According to the Baseball Hall of Fame, Sandberg hit .314 in 1984 and led the NL in runs scored with 114 and triples with 19.",
      "In 1989, a season in which the Cubs also won the National League Eastern Division championship, Sandberg reached the 30-homer mark, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame. According to the Baseball Hall of Fame, he led the National League with 40 home runs, 116 runs, 344 bases, 100 RBI, and 25 steals in 1990.",
      "That year, Sandberg was the first second baseman to lead the National League in home runs since Rogers Hornsby in 1925 and the first second baseman to hit 30 or more home runs in consecutive baseball seasons, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "Sandberg announced his first retirement suddenly in the middle of a season on June 13, 1994, saying he had \"lost the edge it takes to play \u2014 the drive, the motivation, the killer instinct.\" But he returned in 1996 and played two more seasons, before finally calling it quits as a player at the end of the 1997 season.",
      "\"I truly lived my field of dreams right here at Wrigley Field,\" Sandberg told the crowd at Wrigley on Sept. 20, 1997, as recalled by the Society for American Baseball Research.",
      "Sandberg finished his career as a .285 hitter with 282 home runs and a fielding percentage of .989. He notched roughly 68 Wins Above Replacement, per Baseball Reference.",
      "Sandberg was a 10-time All-Star and a winner of nine Gold Glove Awards and seven Silver Slugger Awards. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005, earning more than 76% of the vote in his third year on the ballot.",
      "\"I didn't play the game right because I saw a reward at the end of the tunnel,\" Sandberg said at the time. \"I played it right because that's what you're supposed to do.\"",
      "After his retirement, Sandberg served as a spring training instructor with the Cubs in Mesa, Arizona. From 2007 until 2010, Sandberg was a manager in the Cubs' minor-league system \u2014   first with the Single-A with the Triple-A Iowa Peoria Chiefs, then the Double-A Tennessee Smokies, and finally the Triple-A Lehigh Valley IronPigs within the Phillies' farm system.",
      "When Lou Piniella retired as Cubs manager after the 2010 season, Sandberg was a favorite to take his place. However, Cubs general manager Jim Hendry passed on Sandberg and went with Mike Quade instead.",
      "Sandberg then left the Cubs organization and became a minor league manager for the Phillies. He served as Philadelphia's bench coach and then as manager of the Phillies for three seasons from 2013 to 2015.",
      "Sandberg won 42.8% of his 278 contests as manager of the Phillies before being removed from the post partway through the 2015 season.",
      "For the past decade, Sandberg served as a popular Cubs ambassador. On the 40th anniversary of the 1984 \"Sandberg game\" last year, the Cubs unveiled his statue just outside Wrigley Field near his fellow franchise Hall of Famers.",
      "\"It's miraculous what can happen when dreams meet opportunity and hard work,\" Sandberg said on that occasion. \"Your dreams come true \u2014 and much, much more than you ever dreamed.\"",
      "Sandberg was diagnosed with prostate cancer in January 2024. He underwent treatment and shared he was declared cancer-free in August of that year, but four months later, he let fans know the cancer had come back and spread to other organs.",
      "Sandberg did make an appearance at Cubs spring training in Mesa, Arizona, for Cubs Spring Training in February 2025, along with his former teammates Shawon Dunston, Mark Grace, Rick Sutcliffe, and Fergie Jenkins. Cubs manager Craig Counsell looked like a youngster in awe at Sandberg at the other veterans \u2014 and Counsell talked about the icons' stories as what meant so much to him.",
      "\"People like Ryno, and Hall of Famers, they make an impact like when they step in the room \u2014 and that's what Ryno has done for us already,\" Counsell said during spring training in February. \"He's made an impact already.\"",
      "But Sandberg and the group were also imparting their wisdom on young players like Matt Shaw.",
      "\"That's why we're here. We're here for the players,\" Sandberg said. \"With Matt, you know, I had a conversation \u2014 I could reflect right back to 1982, and being in camp, and having some minor league seasons under my belt with some success, and, 'OK, now it's the Major Leagues' \u2014 just to let him know what I went through, and what it basically was for me to just feel comfortable with what I was doing and feel comfortable with my talents, because that's what got me to that point.\"",
      "In July 2025, Sandberg said he had not been able to be at Wrigley Field as much as he had wanted for the baseball season, but he had been cheering the team on and watching from home.",
      "In Wrigleyville, it was a solemn night Monday as the Wrigley Field marquee honored Sandberg's memory. Many took a seat on the lawn at Gallagher Way alongside the ballpark, as a growing memorial was assembled at the base of Sandberg's statue.",
      "Many made a special trip to Wrigley Field to honor Sandberg and be with other fans. They said they will remember him for his character as much as the way he played the game.",
      "\"He meant a lot to this city, you know, after he played,\" said Ed Twohey. \"I mean, he was an ambassador for the team. He was always around.\"",
      "Matt Lindner said he was at the Sandberg statue just weeks ago, with his daughter as she took her first steps. He too emphasized just how much Sandberg meant to Cubs fans.",
      "\"As a Cubs fan in the 80s and the 90s growing up in the Chicago area, like, he was the Cubs to us, right? Like, he was every kid's hero,\" Lindner said, \"and part of it, as I saw it on social media, I have the means to come over here, and I wanted to see if it was actually real, and you see it lit up on the marquee, and it's about as real as it gets.\"",
      "Cubs manager Counsell reflected Monday night on how Sandberg still attended spring training this year despite his ailing condition.",
      "\"You know, we're saddened of the loss of a great man,\" Counsell said. \"We were lucky as a group this year to have Ryno in spring training, and it was an honor to be around a man battling for his life, but who wanted to come to the baseball park and spend his day with us.\"",
      "Major League Baseball Commissioner Robert D. Manfred Jr. issued a statement honoring Sandberg Monday night.",
      "\"Ryne Sandberg was a legend of the Chicago Cubs franchise and a beloved figure throughout Major League Baseball. \u00a0He was a five-tool player who excelled in every facet of the game thanks to his power, speed and work ethic. \u00a0Ryne earned 10 consecutive All-Star selections, nine straight Gold Gloves, seven Silver Sluggers and 1984 National League MVP honors.",
      "\"Ryne remained active in the game he loved as an ambassador for the Cubs, a manager for the Phillies and in the Minor Leagues, and a frequent participant at the Hall of Fame. \u00a0His many friends across the game were in his corner as he courageously fought cancer in recent years.\u00a0 We will continue to support the important work of Stand Up To Cancer in Ryne's memory.",
      "\"On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to Ryne's family, Cubs fans everywhere and his admirers throughout our National Pastime.\"",

      "Mizelle also cites Boasberg's handling of a case involving alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who were flown to a Salvadoran prison earlier this year. Boasberg ordered the planes to turn around on March 15, after the Trump administration removed the men under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg subsequently held hearings in the case in which he has lambasted the conduct of Justice Department attorneys and questioned whether the Trump administration is acting in good faith to guarantee due process for those it has removed from the U.S. or intends to remove.",
      "\"Throughout the proceedings, Judge Boasberg rushed the government through complex litigation, sometimes giving the Trump Administration less than 48 hours to respond and threatening criminal-contempt proceedings and the appointment of an outside prosecutor against senior Trump Administration officials for failing to comply with an order that had already been vacated,\" Mizelle wrote.",
      "Bondi wrote in a post on X that the judge's remarks \"have undermined the integrity of the judiciary, and we will not stand for that.\"",
      "The complaint was addressed to the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Sri Srinivasan.

    "story": [
      "The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts.",
      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028.",
      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.",
      "Reducing uncertainty",
      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.",

    "summary": "Man facing drug and gun charges seeks dismissal of indictment on grounds that Habba was unlawfully named acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's attempt to keep Alina Habba, his former personal lawyer, as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor has prompted a legal challenge, as a man facing drug and gun charges has alleged that she holds the office unlawfully.",
      "A lawyer for the man, Julien Giraud Jr., asked a federal judge Sunday to toss the indictment or bar Habba or any assistants acting under her authority from exercising prosecutorial powers in the case. He argues that Habba's appointment Thursday to serve as the acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and said that a district court's decision appointing her then-deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace, to temporarily fill the role as the state's top prosecutor is legally controlling.",
      "Giraud is \"facing an imminent criminal trial proceeding under questionable legal authority,\" under Habba, his attorney Thomas Mirigliano wrote in the motion. Mirigliano argued that Habba's reappointment after her nomination to become New Jersey's U.S. attorney is also unconstitutional. Politico first reported the request stemming from Habba's position.",
      "\"By circumventing the constitutionally mandated appointment procedures, and encroaching upon judicial powers explicitly granted by statute, the executive branch has exceeded its lawful authority,\" he wrote, adding that allowing the prosecution of his client to proceed under the current landscape \"would endorse an unconstitutional executive usurpation of judicial authority.\"",
      "The filing from Giraud is the latest twist in Habba's tenure as U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which came to a head last week as she neared the end of her limited term serving temporarily in the role.",
      "Federal law restricted Habba's time in the post to 120 days, unless the federal district court in the state extended her tenure or she won Senate confirmation. But New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination, making it highly unlikely it would advance through the upper chamber.",
      "Last week, judges on the district court in New Jersey invoked a rarely used authority when they declined to keep Habba in her role of interim U.S. attorney as her 120-day term was set to expire. In her place, the judges selected the No. 2 in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office, Desiree Leigh Grace, to serve as U.S. attorney for the state until another candidate for the job was nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "But after the district court's decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Grace, a career prosecutor in the office. Grace said she intended to still serve in the role, sparking confusion over who was leading the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Garden State.",
      "The White House then pulled Habba's nomination to serve as the top prosecutor, a Justice Department official said, as part of a multi-part scheme to keep her temporarily in charge of the office. Following the withdrawal and firing, Habba was appointed first assistant U.S. attorney, Grace's job before her removal, which cleared the way for her to temporarily fill the spot of U.S. attorney in New Jersey under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "The vacancies law limits Habba's time in the position to 210 days from when the vacancy occurred.",
      "Because New Jersey federal judges have a conflict of interest in the Giraud's case due to the order to remove Habba and appoint Grace, Mirigliano's motion has been assigned to Pennsylvania Judge Matthew Brann, who was appointed to the federal district court by President Barack Obama in 2012.",
      "Grace has not indicated whether or not she would challenge Habba's control of the office and seek to enforce the judges' order authorizing her appointment.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorneys Office in New Jersey did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the motion.",

    "summary": "Operation Grayskull helped shutter four heavily trafficked dark web sites where violent child sexual abuse materials were traded and housed.",
    "story": [
      "When FBI agents arrived outside William Spearman's home in the quiet suburb of Madison, Alabama, in November 2022, they were prepared for danger.",
      "Their search warrant was so important to the bureau that it was approved by the FBI director himself. When the agents breached Spearman's door with tactical explosives, Spearman fought back, tussling with the agents as three of his handguns remained barely out of reach.\tThe FBI managed to handcuff and arrest Spearman, a high-value arrest, in what a top Justice Department official called \"one of the most successful\" prosecutions of its kind.",
      "Spearman went by the nickname \"Boss\" and was labeled by the Justice Department as \"one of the most significant\" purveyors of child sex abuse material in the world. His arrest in 2022, his guilty plea a year later and his eventual life sentence were part of an unprecedented takedown of a prodigious child abuse network.",
      "Spearman is one of at least 18 people convicted so far of leading and utilizing the dark web to share hundreds of thousands of unlawful sexually exploitative images of children.\tThe Justice Department calls the investigation and prosecutions Operation Grayskull; it helped secure those arrests and shutter four heavily trafficked dark web sites where violent and horrific images of child sexual abuse were traded and housed.",
      "The Operation Grayskull investigation launched in 2020, when law enforcement agents noticed a spike in traffic to a dark web site suspected of hosting child abuse material. The dark web child abuse sites eventually attracted more than 120,000 members, millions of files and at least 100,000 visits in a single day, according to an FBI official who spoke with CBS News.",
      "\"Even for prosecutors, it is difficult to understand how pervasive this is,\" said Matthew Galeotti, head of the Justice Department Criminal Division.",
      "\"Because it happens on the dark web, people aren't aware of it. It's extremely troubling,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Spearman's case has parallels to many of the others unearthed by Operation Grayskull. Spearman was accused of helping lead a dark web site with thousands of users and members.\tA sentencing memo submitted to the court said it was \"no wonder\" that he had tried to resist the FBI, rather than surrendering.",
      "\"The devices at his desk contained massive quantities of evidence proving that he was the lead administrator of Website A,\" the memo said. \"Unsurprisingly, the defendant's devices also contained an enormous collection of images and videos depicting the rape and abuse of children.\"",
      "Selwyn Rosenstein was sentenced to 28 years in prison in 2022, for\u00a0 operating a dark website for unlawful exploitative images. Prosecutors said the platform \"was not simply a website; it was a large, active community of pedophiles and (abuse material) enthusiasts. And it existed in part because of the Defendant's criminal acts.\"",
      "Rosenstein possessed such a large quantity of abusive images, he needed to store some on a server he used to run his business, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Speaking from a second floor conference room at Justice Department headquarters in Washington last week, Galeotti told CBS News the members of these dark web child abuse sites often \"earn\" membership by paying a fee, \"helping moderate the site\" or contributing child abuse images or material.",
      "Galeotti said, \"We luckily have very sophisticated prosecutors and agents who work specifically on this kind of thing. These are people who have a more of a technical understanding.\"",
      "\"The defendants in this case, as sadistic as they may be, are somewhat sophisticated,\" and make use of encryption, he added.",
      "Operation Grayskull also secured the conviction of Matthew Garrell of Raleigh, North Carolina, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for operating on a dark web site for abuse material.",
      "\"Garrell engaged in an extremely complex and technologically sophisticated conspiracy that far exceeds the typical child-exploitation offenses,\" prosecutors said.",
      "They argued in a court filing that Garrell possessed a predator's \"handbook,\" with \"detailed instructions\" for grooming children for future abuse.",
      "The takedown of dark web leaders and users also included the convictions of men from Virginia, Maryland, Indiana, Texas, Washington, Arkansas, Michigan and Oklahoma.",
      "\"They were part of an online community of hundreds of thousands of people, with leadership roles rules and a common dedicated purpose\" said Chris Delzotto, an acting FBI deputy assistant director. Delzotto told CBS News, \"Few people would have envisioned how (child abuse materials) would permeate the internet, the way it has today.\"",
      "The federal investigation which uncovered and shuttered the first dark web site, also led to the closure of three others. Abbigail Beccaccio, an FBI unit chief, told CBS News. \"The leadership team that operated one of the sites also operated several of the others.\"",
      "The Justice Department is touting the shutdown of those sites as a victory to help deter future abuse or production of unlawful images. \"This is one of the most successful of all time,\" Galeotti said. \"We dismantled four websites that have not regenerated.\"",

They found 11 people had been shot, one of whom died at the scene. The deceased person was a 27-year-old man, although his identity has not been released, CBS affiliate WANF-TV reported. Police said all of the victims' ages ranged from 18 to 29 years old.",

      "The shooting stemmed from a parking dispute, according to the police chief. He said officers were searching for three men and one woman who they believe initiated the incident. They have asked anyone in the community with information to report tips to the department.",
      "Schierbaum said he expected officials would release video from the scene soon. Police recovered firearms and 34 shell casings on the scene and investigators are working with their ballistics lab and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, he said.",
      "Police are investigating 12 violent incidents that left 29 people injured and two dead over the weekend, Schierbaum said. Other incidents were related to cars being booted or domestic violence, but the chief said investigators were still seeking clarity on what led up to the shooting on Edgewood Avenue and they are asking anyone with information to reach out to officials.",
      "Police don't yet know what prompted the shooting, but they aren't seeing any indications that it was gang-related, Schierbaum said. The majority of the victims were likely innocent bystanders.",
      "The chief and Mayor Andre Dickens noted that the city has seen positive trends in crime, including reductions in shootings and homicides. There have been 57 homicides in the city this year, compared to 76 at this time last year, Schierbaum said.",
      "\"We haven't had a weekend like this in a long time,\" Dickens said. \"We know that summer months often bring some of the most challenging times when it comes to crime and gun violence in our communities. We are doing all that we can to prevent these tragedies, even before they happen.\"",

    "summary": "Trump says he's \"very disappointed\" with Vladimir Putin, and he's shortening the deadline for the Russian leader to agree a ceasefire with Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Monday a significant tightening of his deadline for Russia's Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. He said as he met with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his visit to Scotland that the 50-day deadline he announced earlier this month would be reduced to less than two weeks, citing a lack of progress in negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said as he headed in for his meeting with Starmer that he was \"very disappointed\" in Russia's leader over the ongoing bombing of Ukrainian cities, and that the deadline he gave Russia a couple weeks ago to agree to a truce would be reduced.",
      "Mr. Trump said earlier this month that if Russia failed to agree to a ceasefire within the 50-day timeframe, the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that continue to do business with Russia. That would have meant a deal agreed by around the end of August.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday, as he sat down with Starmer, that he was \"going to make a new deadline of about 10 or 12 days from today.\"",
      "\"There's no reason in waiting,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We just don't see any progress being made.\"",
      "\"I've spoken to President Putin a lot, I've gotten along with him very well,\" Mr. Trump said earlier, before sitting down with Starmer.",
      "But he lamented that the Russian leader, \"goes out and starts launching rockets into some city, like Kyiv, and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever, you have bodies lying all over the street.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he was \"very disappointed in Putin,\" adding: \"I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number, because I think I already know the answer what's going to happen.\"",
      "Russia rejected the deadline when the White House first announced it, calling it \"unacceptable.\"",
      "\"I'm not so interested in talking anymore,\" Mr. Trump said of Putin, explaining that he and Putin will have a nice conversation, and then the following day, the Russians killed more Ukrainians.",
      "Seated alongside Starmer, Mr. Trump also addressed the situation in Gaza, saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid.",
      "\"Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved.\"",
      "While ostensibly a private trip, marked by multiple rounds of golf on his own luxury courses in Scotland, Mr. Trump has also done business \u2013 including nailing down a long-sought-after\u00a0U.S.-European Union trade agreement.",
      "After meeting for just over one hour with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen on Sunday, Mr. Trump emerged to say, \"We have good news. We've reached a deal.\"",
      "When considered as a combined economy, the EU bloc is the second largest in the world behind the U.S. Including goods and services, U.S.-EU trade is worth about $2 trillion per year.",
      "\"I think it's great that we made a deal today, instead of playing games,\" Mr. Trump said of the framework trade agreement. \"I think it's the biggest deal ever made.\"",
      "\"It's a big deal, it's a huge deal,\" agreed Von der Leyen. \"It will bring stability. It will bring predictability.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's meeting with Starmer is also touching on trade, though the U.S. and the U.K. already\u00a0agreed on a framework trade deal\u00a0last month. Starmer has made it clear he wants to keep pushing Mr. Trump to further ease tariffs on British steel and other imports as the details of the agreement are hashed out.",
      "Mr. Trump said his meeting with Starmer would provide a chance to celebrate the U.S.-U.K. agreement, along with the new EU deal.",
      "Most EU member nations' governments voiced support for that agreement on Monday, though some of them unenthusiastically \u2013 and the French Prime Minister even took a jab at the bloc, accusing it of \"submission\" to Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump said the tariff rate for the EU's 27 member countries would be 15% for most imports, including vehicles. The EU, meanwhile, agreed to purchase U.S. military hardware, $750 billion of American energy, and to increase its collective investment in the U.S. by $600 billion.",
      "There was good news for U.S. companies that sell products into the EU market, too, as Mr. Trump announced that all 27 EU nations \"will be opened up to trade with the United States at zero tariff.\"",
      "The agreement was made at Mr. Trump's luxury golf resort in Turnberry, on the Scottish coast, where the president spent the weekend teeing off.",
      "The deal avoids a trans-Atlantic trade war that could have unfolded on Friday, when Mr. Trump had threatened to impose a blanket 30% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, which had vowed to retaliate.",
      "That deadline remains in place for countries that have yet to make a deal with the U.S., including Mexico, Canada, and most consequentially, China. On Monday, Mr. Trump said tariffs for countries that don't reach a deal with the U.S. will be \"somewhere in the 15% to 20% range,\" which differs from the 15% to 50% range he floated last week.",
      "Trade talks between Beijing and Washington were taking place Monday in Stockholm, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in interviews over the weekend that the Aug. 1 deadline for deals to be reached wasn't flexible.",
      "\"No extensions, no more grace periods. August 1, the tariffs are set. They'll go into place. Customs will start collecting the money, and off we go,\" Lutnick said.",

      "The military early Sunday\u00a0carried out aid airdrops into Gaza, which included packages of aid with flour, sugar and canned food, \"as part of the ongoing efforts to allow and facilitate the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip,\" the IDF posted on Telegram.",
      "Food experts have warned for months of the risk of famine in Gaza, where Israel has restricted aid because it says Hamas siphons off goods to help bolster its rule, without providing evidence for that claim. Images emerging from Gaza in recent days of emaciated children have fanned global criticism of Israel, including from close allies, who have called for an end to the war and the humanitarian catastrophe it has spawned.",
      "\"What's happening in Gaza right now is appalling. Gaza is now in the brink of a full catastrophe, and we've been working out, over the months, to try and relief (sic) the sufferings of the Palestinian people,\" French Foreign Minister Jean\u2011No\u00ebl\u202f Barrot said\u00a0Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

      "\"Welcome announcement of humanitarian pauses in Gaza to allow our aid through,\" U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher said on X. \"In contact with our teams on the ground who will do all we can to reach as many starving people as we can in this window.\"",
      "The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza said on Sunday that hospitals recorded six new deaths due to malnutrition in the past 24 hours, including two children. The organization said at least 133 people, including 87 children, have died from malnutrition in the Gaza Strip.",

      "The U.N.'s World Food Program said it welcomes Israel's move and that it has enough food to feed the entire population of 2.1 million Palestinians in Gaza for nearly three months. In a statement, it said that a third of Gaza's population were not eating for days and nearly half a million were enduring famine-like conditions.",
      "It said it hopes that Israel's assurances for secure corridors will \"allow for a surge in urgently needed food assistance to reach hungry people without further delays.\" However, the WFP reiterated that a ceasefire is \"the only way for humanitarian assistance to reach the entire civilian population in Gaza with critical food supplies in a consistent, predictable, orderly and safe manner.\"",
      "Israel's decision to order a localized pause in fighting came days after ceasefire efforts between Israel and Hamas\u00a0appeared to be in doubt.

      "\"It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,\" economists with investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation.\"",
      "The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast.",
      "EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.)",
      "The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.",

      "The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration.",
      "\"This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,\" the White House said Monday in a\u00a0fact sheet about the pact.",

      "Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports.",
      "More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week \u2014 both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff \u2014 also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said.",
      "\"[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,\" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products.",
      "Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters.",
      "\"We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,\" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the\u00a0 deal \"at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market.\"",
      "According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement.",
      "The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April.",

    "summary": "Senate Democrats told the secretary of state they have \"grave concerns\" about the U.S. role in financing GHF, the main group distributing aid in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "A group of Democratic senators led by Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland is urging the Trump administration to suspend American financial support for the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a private food distribution organization that has been heavily criticized for the way it delivers food aid to Gazans and because so many have been killed trying to reach its distribution sites.",
      "The U.S. and Israel have advocated for the recently established GHF to replace the United Nations, which has built an extensive network of humanitarian workers inside Gaza over decades. Israel accuses the U.N. of bias and collusion with Hamas.",
      "In a letter sent to Secretary of State Marco Rubio Sunday, the 21 senators expressed \"grave\" concerns about \"the U.S. role in and financial support for the troubled GHF.\"",
      "\"We urge you to immediately cease all U.S. funding for GHF and resume support for the existing UN-led aid coordination mechanisms with enhanced oversight to ensure that humanitarian aid reaches civilians in need,\" the letter reads.",
      "The U.N. warns that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is growing increasingly dire as more Palestinians are in danger of starvation after a months-long Israeli blockade, and recent military operations complicated humanitarian efforts to help. The IDF claims there is no starvation.",
      "Van Hollen, who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as well as the powerful Appropriations Committee, told CBS News \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday, \"American taxpayers should not be spending one penny to fund this private organization backed by mercenaries and by the IDF that has become a death trap,\" noting that scores of Gazans were shot and killed as starving people crowded the GHF sites to obtain food.",
      "The letter focuses on a $30 million pledge from the State Department, announced last month, and on GHF's operations, particularly its use of armed contractors who stand behind IDF soldiers at food distribution sites in four designated military zones. Starving Gazans must travel to those areas, which is difficult for those too weak to move.",
      "\"Blurring the lines between delivery of aid and security operations shatters well-established norms that have governed distribution of humanitarian aid since the ratification of the Geneva Conventions in 1949,\" the letter says.",
      "U.S. allies have also been critical of the tactics used by the U.S. and Israeli-backed GHF.",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot told Margaret Brennan Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" that Gaza is on the \"brink of food catastrophe\" and that France expects \"the Israeli government to stop the operations of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that has caused [a] bloodbath in humanitarian health distribution lines in Gaza.\"",
      "U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Friday that a thousand Palestinians have been killed trying to access food since May 27.",
      "\"We hold video calls with our own humanitarians who are starving before our eyes,\" Guterres said. \"We will continue to speak out at every opportunity. But words don't feed hungry children.\"",
      "The U.N. human rights office said 1,054 people were killed while trying to obtain food since late May, and of those, 766 were killed while trying to reach sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The others were killed when gunfire erupted around U.N. convoys or aid sites.",
      "The group of senators led by Van Hollen are seeking answers about whether necessary oversight is being bypassed to benefit the GHF. Their letter cites public reports that the Trump administration authorized the funds under a \"priority directive,\" which meant it could avoid \"a comprehensive audit that is usually required for groups receiving USAID grants for the first time.\"",
      "The senators want to see the GHF's \"complete funding application and all supporting documentation\" and demand to know whether any statutory and regulatory requirements were waived.",
      "They also asked Rubio about the procurement mechanism that resulted in the $30 million in funding, and they want to know who signed the agreement, who might be liable for compliance violations and whether officials were aware of potential concerns raised by USAID about \"GHF's ability to protect Palestinians while delivering food aid.\"",
      "The State Department said it generally does not comment on congressional correspondence. A department spokesperson said Friday that the funding has been allocated, but it has not yet been disbursed to GHF.",
      "On Saturday, amid international outcry, the Israel Defense Force began airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza and said it would establish humanitarian corridors to \"enable the safe movement of UN convoys delivering food and medicine to the population.\"",
      "The U.N. has said the airdrops are insufficient. Past airdrops have fallen on Gazans and killed them. Now the approximately 2 million people live in Gaza and have been herded into an even more limited zone that lacks extensive open space where air-dropped pallets can land.",
      "Israel's announcement came after extensive international outcry at images of starving children, and reports of death. Leaders in Europe, including French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Fredreich Merz, coordinated Saturday by phone. A readout of the call released by the UK said the three leaders said the situation in Gaza is \"appalling\" and \"emphasized the urgent need for an immediate ceasefire, for Israel to lift all restrictions on aid and urgently provide those suffering in Gaza with the food they so desperately need.\"",
      "On Friday, two Jordanian officials said they were considering airdrops and the United Arab Emirates sent a 7,000-ton aid ship to Gaza's shores. But it has not been determined who will distribute the food once it arrives.",
      "The GHF says it has distributed more than 91 million meals to Gazans, but there have been almost daily reports of civilians being injured or killed as they try to reach one of the group's four distribution hubs, all located in southern Gaza.",
      "In an interview with BBC News this week, Anthony Aguliar, a U.S. Army veteran and former contractor for GHF, detailed what he says he saw on the ground behind IDF lines during humanitarian aid distribution, calling the operation \"amateur.\"",
      "\"I witnessed the Israeli Defense Forces shooting at the crowds of Palestinians. I witnessed the Israeli Defense Forces firing a main gun tank round from the Merkava tank into a crowd of people,\" Aguilar said. \"In my most frank assessment, I would say that they're criminal. In my entire career, I have never witnessed the level of brutality and use of indiscriminate and unnecessary force against a civilian population, an unarmed, starving population.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the GHF called Aguilar's claims \"materially false\" and said he had been terminated from his position for \"misconduct.\"",
      "The group has also been criticized by the U.N., which said GHF's tactics are neither adequate nor safe and make it more difficult for Gazans too weak to travel to military zones to secure food.",
      "Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner general for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, which provides support for Palestinian refugees, condemned the GHF in June, calling it \"an abomination\" and \"a death trap costing more lives than it saves.\"",
      "As the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza deteriorated further this week, the GHF and U.N. groups continued to blame each other.",
      "In several public statements and social media posts last week, GHF said the responsibility for the mass starvation lies with the U.N. for allowing their full aid trucks inside Gaza to sit untouched and undistributed.",
      "\"The U.N. cannot deliver this humanitarian aid to the people who need it most, and I'm not sure what the reason is,\" said GHF spokesperson Chapin Fay in a video posted to X, which showed him standing in front of U.N. aid trucks. \"Whether it's looters, safety or whether they're playing politics, it just doesn't matter. The people of Gaza deserve better.\"",
      "The executive chairman of GHF, Reverend Johnnie Moore, in an interview with conservative commentator Ben Shapiro this week accused the U.N. of \"playing politics with people's lives.\"",
      "\"They're actually basically a willful participant on the Hamas side of the negotiating table in the ceasefire negotiations, by refusing to distribute aid and spreading this narrative around the world that the people of Gaza are going to starve if Hamas doesn't, in effect, get its demands at the negotiating table,\" Moore said.",
      "The U.N. World Food Programme says hundreds of aid trucks are ready to move, but the approval needed from the Israeli military to transport and distribute that aid is not coming quickly enough. In a statement Friday, they said just over half of their requests to collect cargo were approved and convoys were typically delayed, sometimes up to nearly two days, awaiting permission to travel within Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, a UNICEF spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that their supplies of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food or RUTF \u2014 used for treating severely acutely malnourished children \u2014 is expected to run out in mid-August if more is not allowed into Gaza.",
      "\"We are now facing a dire situation that we are running out of therapeutic supplies,\" said Salim Oweis, a spokesperson for UNICEF in Amman, Jordan. \"That's really dangerous for children as they face hunger and malnutrition at the moment,\" he added.",
      "Oweis said UNICEF had only enough RUTF left to treat 3,000 children. In the first two weeks of July alone, UNICEF treated 5,000 children facing acute malnutrition in Gaza.",
      "The UNICEF spokesperson said the agency is unaware of whether GHF is distributing this type of specialized food and emphasized that it must be given to children after they are assessed by professional health workers to be suffering from acute malnutrition. GHF did not respond to CBS News when asked if the foundation also distributes specialized high-nutrient food for acutely malnourished children.",

    "summary": "Expers recommend focusing on meal quality and hunger cues rather than traditional eating schedules, noting that personalized meal timing supports sustainable wellness.",

      "New York-based certified holistic nutritionist Robin DeCicco shares the importance of fiber for overall health.",
      "Breakfast, lunch and dinner have been a staple regimen for diet and nutrition \u2014 but is it necessary for overall health?",
      "Statistics show that most Americans (64%) consume three meals daily and 28% consume two meals \u2014 but some may struggle to hit three meals a day, while others prefer smaller, more frequent meals.",
      "Serena Poon, a certified nutritionist and longevity wellness advisor based in Los Angeles, said she considers the concept of three meals a \"more cultural convention\" than a \"biological necessity.\"",
      "MORNING WORKOUTS CAN BOOST WEIGHT LOSS IF ONE KEY HABIT IS FOLLOWED, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"There\u2019s no magic in \u2018three meals a day,\u2019\" she told Fox News Digital. \"What matters is the quality of your food, the timing of your meals, and how well both align with your unique biology and lifestyle.\"",
      "\"A flexible routine, such as two nourishing meals and a snack, or three well-balanced meals eaten within a 10- to 12-hour window, has strong scientific backing and fits comfortably into most modern schedules.\"",
      "The quality of food matters more than the timing of meals, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "A 2024 review published in JAMA found that lower meal frequency, earlier calorie distribution and time-restricted eating led to greater weight loss and metabolic improvements than the traditional three-meal pattern, Poon pointed out.",
      "\"From a nutrition and metabolism perspective, what you eat matters more than when you eat.\"",
      "In another study published this year in Nature Medicine, overweight or obese adults who ate only during an eight-hour window \"reduced visceral fat and cardiometabolic risk\" just as effectively as standard eating.",
      "Extremely low frequencies of eating, such as one meal a day, can \"heighten hunger and risk micronutrient gaps, so they require professional guidance,\" Poon warned.",
      "THIS BREAKFAST MISTAKE MAKES PEOPLE REACH FOR SUGARY SNACKS IN THE AFTERNOON",
      "Lauri Wright, PhD, RDN, director of nutrition programs and associate professor at the USF College of Public Health, agreed that the idea of eating three meals a day is cultural, evolving largely from social norms, work schedules and industrialization rather than scientific evidence.",
      "\"From a nutrition and metabolism perspective, what you eat matters more than when you eat for most people,\" she said.",
      "People who rise early in the day may get most benefit from \"front-loading\" calories into breakfast and lunch, an expert suggested. (iStock)",
      "\"Some individuals thrive on three balanced meals a day, while others do well with smaller, more frequent meals. What\u2019s important is meeting your body's nutritional needs across the day.\"",
      "Regular meals can help stabilize blood sugar, support energy levels and prevent overeating, especially for those who have conditions like diabetes or are prone to \"energy crashes,\" Wright noted.",
      "EATING MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES LINKED TO SURPRISING EFFECT ON SLEEP",
      "\"But there's no one-size-fits-all pattern,\" she said. \"Skipping breakfast or consolidating meals, for example, can work for some people without negative health effects, as long as nutrient quality and total intake are adequate.\"",
      "\"In short, three meals a day can be a helpful guideline, but it\u2019s not a strict requirement for health.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Poon suggested that \"personalization is key\" when it comes to eating frequency, but most healthy adults thrive on an eight- to-12-hour eating window that begins within two hours of waking and ends at least three hours before bedtime.",
      "She also pointed to study data showing that eating within a 10-hour window for eight weeks improved appetite regulation, sleep quality and morning GLP-1 levels in young adults.",
      "Listening to your body\u2019s hunger cues, fueling yourself with nutrient-dense foods and maintaining a consistent eating routine that fits your lifestyle are what matter most, experts agree. (iStock)",
      "People who rise early in the day may benefit from \"front-loading\" calories into breakfast and lunch, Poon suggested, while shift workers may function better with a later window.",
      "Those with conditions such as diabetes, eating disorder histories or pregnancy should ask their doctor about individualized diet plans.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"Consider lifestyle, medical needs (like diabetes), age and preferences,\" Poon advised. \"Some thrive on three meals, others on intermittent fasting or grazing \u2014 it's about consistency, nutrient quality and listening to your body.\"",
      "The expert also recommended paying attention to internal signals and hunger cues, like gentle stomach rumbling, a dip in focus or mild irritability. A meal should end at \"comfortable satiety,\" or a feeling of satisfaction.",
      "\"Three meals a day can be a helpful guideline, but it\u2019s not a strict requirement for health,\" an expert said. (iStock)",
      "\"Intuitive eating practices have been linked to lower morning cortisol, better mental health and sleep scores, and improved mood metrics,\" she said.",
      "Instead of eating based on the clock, listening to authentic hunger and fullness cues will help maintain steady energy, sharpen focus and avoid last-minute, less-nutritious choices, Poon added.",

The review also aims to ensure the university is abiding by all state and federal immigration laws, after evidence was also uncovered that the school was allegedly admitting illegal immigrants and hiding such information from outside entities.",
      "\"I am reaching out to update you about next steps in response to the concerns raised by elected officials regarding Belmont's compliance with state and federal immigration laws, as well as executive orders addressing DEI in higher education,\" the letter, penned by Belmont University President Greg Jones, stated. \"While we make every effort to ensure compliance and continue to maintain our belief that Belmont complies with all applicable laws, we take these concerns seriously.

      "The effort to hold Belmont accountable for allegedly maintaining its DEI policies in light of federal directives to terminate them has been spearheaded by Tennessee Republican Rep. Andy Ogles, who has been receiving information from whistle-blowers at the school.",
      "Ogles sounded the alarm earlier this month, after obtaining undercover recordings showing a student services faculty member in Belmont's \"Division of Student Success and Flourishing\" admitting the school has maintained its DEI initiatives but \"just change[d] on how we talk about it.\"",

      "Another source, according to Ogles' office, shared screenshots of an email chain showing Belmont intends to keep its faculty DEI committee for the next academic year.

The document also instructs search committees to engage in a post-mortem for any positions for which a \"diverse candidate\" does not apply to \"revisit how to best advertise the position to attract qualified, diverse applicants.\"",
      "Earlier this year, President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring the end of DEI policies in higher education, calling them discriminatory. (Getty Images)",

      "With ChatGPT agent, we're moving from AI chatbots that merely react to those that are proactive and decision-makers. As AI agents become increasingly autonomous, their capabilities will continue to expand. However, the biggest challenge for OpenAI will be striking the right balance between convenience, safety, and privacy.",

      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why dogs see TV differently than we do",
      "In the past, older TVs didn't do much for dogs. Their lower refresh rates caused flickering that was hard for canine eyes to process. Dogs see flicker more sensitively than humans do. So while you were watching your favorite sitcom, your dog was probably just seeing a strobe light. Today's high-definition, high-frame-rate TVs are a different story. The improved visuals and sound mean dogs can now recognize what's happening onscreen and respond to it.",
      "What the study found about how dogs respond to different kinds of tv content",
      "Researchers developed something called the Dog Television Viewing Scale (DTVS). It's a 16-question tool that helps measure how dogs respond to different kinds of TV content, like barking, tail-wagging, or even following something off-screen. They surveyed over 650 dog owners. More than 450 respondents reported that their dogs actually watch TV. From there, three main behavior patterns emerged:",
      "Dogs responded most strongly to other animals, especially dogs and wildlife.",
      "Some dogs physically tracked an object as it moved off the screen. This suggests they think the image might exist beyond the TV, like in real life.",
      "Dogs also reacted to people and inanimate objects, such as cars or doorbells.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Personality plays a big role in how dogs react to TV",
      "The researchers found that personality, not breed or age, influenced how dogs reacted. Excitable dogs were more likely to exhibit \"follow\" behavior, actively watching and expecting movement off-screen. Fearful or reactive dogs were more sensitive to non-animal stimuli, like human voices or doorbells. Interestingly, dogs' sex, breed, or even whether they were neutered didn't seem to affect their TV habits. Exposure to TV also wasn't a strong factor, meaning dogs aren't necessarily \"trained\" to watch.",
      "What this means for dog owners",
      "If you leave the TV on for your dog while you're out, you're not alone, and it might even help them feel more at ease. But not all dogs benefit the same way. The content matters. Animal-heavy programming could excite or soothe a curious pup. But shows with loud sounds or human conflict could stress out a fearful dog. Some streaming services, like DOGTV, are now designing content tailored for dogs. This research gives that idea more scientific credibility.",
      "Illustration of a dog watching TV. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can TV help shelter dogs?",
      "The findings suggest a new tool for improving dog welfare, especially in shelters. Tailored TV programming could help reduce stress and provide mental enrichment for dogs waiting to be adopted. Still, more research is needed. Most of the data came from owners whose dogs already engage with TV. Behavior reports were based on what owners observed, rather than direct measurement.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "TV might not just be background noise for your dog. For some, it could be entertainment. For others, it might even be stress relief or stimulation. And thanks to modern screen tech, they're seeing it clearer than ever before. So next time you catch your dog watching with you, take a moment. They may really be following the action.",

      "What does this have to do with protecting your parents from scammers? None of us is invulnerable, not even a hero like Odysseus. The trick is knowing what you can't resist and, one way or another, avoiding it. You can teach your parents all there is to know about modern-day fraud and the dangers of sharing personal information, but there's still this Siren song out there that will have them throwing all that knowledge out the window in a heartbeat.",
      "What this Siren song is varies from person to person and day to day. It might be a near-perfect clone of a grandchild's voice, calling in a panic and asking for an urgent transfer to bail them out of trouble, if not jail.

      "The point is that all of us, no matter how well-informed, careful, or clever, can be exploited by a fast-talking scammer. All it takes is the right hook at exactly the wrong moment, and we're along for the ride. All the more so as we get older and technology advances rapidly, leaving us behind. Scammers rely on emotional reactions as much as, if not more than, ignorance. Letting your parents know about the dangers of engaging with strangers (even if they claim to be from Visa or\u00a0the IRS) is crucial, but it's not enough. Scammers exploit fear, greed, and the desire to please others or simply be a good citizen. They're experts at raising the emotional toll of interrupting, interrogating, or ignoring them. In short, getting drawn into discussions with scammers is playing with fire.",
      "(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "The best solution: Cut off scammers at the source",
      "So, what's the solution? Stop the scammers from making contact in the first place. They're getting your parents' contact information and much more personal data besides, from somewhere. Stop them from getting their hands on it, and they won't have the chance to manipulate your parents into doing something they'll regret.",
      "People-search sites are a great source of information for scammers. Fast, easy, and inexpensive, they fuel smaller operations and individual scammers. People-search sites are a kind of data broker; the other major kind, sometimes called private-database data brokers, are even worse. These data brokers sell personal data in bulk to other businesses.",
      "They've been caught selling the personal data of vulnerable adults before, offering data packs that focused on people who needed in-home care or were suffering from cognitive impairment or decline, for example. This is worse than posting your parents' details publicly. This is packaging up those details and marketing them directly to scammers.",
      "An elderly parent and his daughter \u00a0looking at a laptop screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsso)",
      "Use a data removal service to protect your parents",
      "The good news is that a\u00a0data removal service can scrub both people-search sites and the databases of those other, more shadowy data brokers clean of your parents' information. Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, property values, health information, shopping habits, political preferences, and more. You can take all this down in one fell swoop with a personal data removal service.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you and your parents.",

      "Instead of shutting down to recharge, the Walker S2 walks to a nearby swap station. When one battery starts to run low, the robot turns its torso, uses built-in tools on its arms and removes the drained battery. It then picks up a fresh one, plugs it in and gets back to work immediately. The entire process takes about three minutes. This system is similar to battery-swapping tech used in electric vehicles.

Instead of fixed fares, Delta is using AI to make airfare more personal than ever. Instead of fixed prices, the system now analyzes your habits, booking history and even the time of day to predict what you might pay.",

      "Passengers traveling through an airport\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is AI-powered ticket pricing?",
      "Traditional ticket pricing relies on fare \"buckets,\" where customers are grouped into categories based on when and how they book their tickets. Delta's AI ticket pricing system eliminates static rates, instead analyzing real-time information to calculate what a specific customer might be willing to spend on a seat for each particular flight.",
      "Delta President Glen Hauenstein describes this as a reengineering of pricing, calling AI a\u00a0\"super analyst\" that works 24/7, seeking the optimal price for every traveler, every time. The airline has partnered with Fetcherr, which provides the underlying technology and also supports other global airlines.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why Delta wants personalized pricing",
      "Let's be honest. Airlines aren't adopting new, high-tech pricing systems to make less money. Delta says early results from AI-driven pricing show\u00a0\"amazingly favorable\" revenues. The airline believes that with AI, it can maximize profits by more precisely matching fares to what each passenger is willing to pay, based on a wide range of data inputs, from booking history to market trends. Delta's strategy is simple \u2014 a price that's available on that flight, at that time, to you, the individual.",
      "Passengers traveling through an airport (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does this affect travelers?",
      "If you've ever wondered why airfare fluctuates every time you check, get ready for even more volatility. Delta's system could theoretically offer you a different price than someone else for the exact same seat, calculated in real time by AI.",
      "Pros: You might get special offers or early discounts if the AI needs to fill seats.",
      "Cons: It becomes much harder to know if you're getting a \"fair\" deal because the price shown is purely based on what AI thinks you'll pay, not what everyone else pays.",
      "Some privacy advocates worry this could disadvantage customers who lack the means or time to search for the best deals, potentially charging the highest prices to those unable to shop around.",
      "We reached out to Delta for a comment, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"There is no fare product Delta has ever used, is testing or plans to use that targets customers with individualized offers based on personal information or otherwise. A variety of market forces drive the dynamic pricing model that\u2019s been used in the global industry for decades, with new tech simply streamlining this process. Delta always complies with regulations around pricing and disclosures.\"",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Industry impact and growing criticism over AI ticket pricing",
      "Delta's transparency regarding this shift has drawn national attention. Other airlines are already testing their own AI fare systems, and experts expect the industry to follow suit. Yet, privacy advocates and some lawmakers are voicing strong concerns. Critics argue that letting AI determine pricing behind the scenes is, in the words of Consumer Watchdog, like airlines\u00a0\"hacking our brains\" to find the maximum price we'll accept.",
      "The legal risks are still emerging. While price variation based on demand or timing is not new, using AI for ultra-personalized pricing raises uncomfortable questions about discrimination and fairness, especially since prior research suggests that poorer customers often receive the worst deals.",
      "Passengers sitting on a plane\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "You'll notice airfare feels even more personal now. Every time you search, the price could change just for you. Gone are the days of universal fares. The AI looks at your browsing, booking habits and timing. You may see special deals if Delta needs to fill your seat quickly. However, the price can also increase if it senses that you'll pay more.",
      "Shopping around is now a must. You can use a VPN if you want to outsmart the system by masking your location and IP address. A VPN helps prevent airlines from tracking your searches and adjusting prices based on your geographic region. Quick decisions might save you money, but waiting could result in a price increase. Privacy matters more than ever. The airline learns about your habits with every search you make. Your digital footprint affects your fares. In short, you have more power and more responsibility. Be smart, be flexible and always compare before making a purchase.",

      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier examines the U.S. power supply on 'Special Report.'",
      "If your electricity bill seems shockingly high, you're not imagining it. A big part of the spike is being driven by rising artificial intelligence electricity demand.",
      "PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States, says electricity usage is climbing sharply this summer. Some areas may see bills increase by as much as 20%. One of the main drivers behind this trend is the growing power consumption from data centers that support AI systems like ChatGPT and other generative tools.",

      "Electric transmission lines under strain from growing electricity demand\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the power grid is struggling to keep up",
      "PJM supplies electricity to 67 million customers across 13 states: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.",
      "In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers. Most of them are connected to the same grid that serves homes and businesses, which means the cost of that power growth is shared by everyone.",

      "AI and data centers are fueling a surge in energy use",
      "AI took off in 2023 when tools like ChatGPT became widely adopted. Since then, companies have been racing to build more infrastructure to keep up. PJM's territory now has the largest number of data centers in the world.",
      "Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.",
      "AI data center needing high energy demands\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why electricity prices are rising across the U.S.",
      "While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.",
      "Large solar farm generating renewable energy\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How AI is increasing your electric bill",
      "Even if you never use AI tools yourself, you are still likely paying for their growth. The cost of expanding the data center's power supply is spread across all grid users, including regular households.",
      "PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.",
      "To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.",
      "Tips to reduce your electricity bill",
      "Looking for ways to lower your electricity bill as prices surge? Here are some effective tips you can start using today:",
      "Unplug electronics and appliances when not in use to avoid phantom power drain.Upgrade to\u00a0smart thermostats and LED lighting for greater energy efficiency.Run major appliances (like washers and dishwashers) during off-peak hours.Consider adding weather stripping or insulation to block drafts and improve cooling/heating.Monitor your energy usage with\u00a0smart plugs or an electricity usage monitor for real-time feedback.",

      "The Velvet Sundown reportedly earned more than $34,000 in a single month from streaming platforms. And it's not alone. Other acts, such as Aventhis, a \"dark country\" musician with over 600,000 monthly listeners, are also believed to be powered by AI-generated content.",
      "This isn't happening in a studio with a team of producers. It's often just one person inputting text and outputting tracks. The barrier to entry is nearly gone. With a laptop and internet connection, anyone can create and distribute AI-generated songs on a massive scale.",

Watching an AI-generated band pull in massive streaming numbers feels like being pushed aside by something that isn't even real.",

Music schools are also adapting. Educators are now teaching students how to utilize AI tools to enhance their creative process, rather than avoiding them.",
      "Still, even those who are optimistic about the technology admit that it could completely upend the music business. As AI-generated content becomes increasingly easy to produce, the competition for listener attention and streaming dollars will intensify.",

Whether it's rock, country, or pop, AI-generated songs are showing up in more playlists every day. The real question is not whether AI music is good enough. It's whether listeners will care that it wasn't made by a human. As technology improves and the lines between human and machine blur, that question will only get harder to answer.",

      "3. Report phishing emails: Use Outlook\u2019s built-in tools to report suspicious messages as phishing. You can also forward them to Microsoft at reportphishing@microsoft.com.",
      "4. Use strong antivirus software: Consider using strong antivirus software with built-in phishing and link protection to catch threats before they reach you. Stay vigilant when it comes to emails, phone calls, or messages from unknown sources asking for personal information. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or providing sensitive details unless you can verify the legitimacy of the request. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "6. Consider personal data removal services: After phishing attempts, your data may end up circulating among data brokers, increasing your risk of future scams and identity theft. Data removal services can help reduce the visibility of your personal information by submitting removal requests to dozens of people-search and broker sites. This limits how easily scammers and spammers can find and target you.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "These updates are just the beginning. Lucid is investing heavily in advanced driver-assistance and automation, with a clear focus on safety, comfort and long-term innovation.",
      "Lucid now joins the ranks of top hands-free driving systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving and GM's Super Cruise both offer hands-free driving on highways, though they differ in how they monitor driver attention and what roads they support. Ford's BlueCruise is another major option, available on a growing number of mapped highways. Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot goes a step further by letting drivers take their eyes off the road in certain traffic conditions, though it's only available in limited markets for now.",
      "The rearview of Lucid Air with hands-free software. (Lucid Motors)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're driving a car with advanced driver-assistance features, such as the Lucid Air or similar models, you're likely noticing real changes in your daily routine. With hands-off driving now available on select highways, those stressful commutes can feel a little easier. Sitting in stop-and-go traffic doesn't have to be such a chore anymore. Long road trips? Suddenly, they're much more comfortable. Many automakers, not just Lucid, are pushing out updates directly to your car, so you can access new tools without ever stepping into a service center.",
      "Safety is at the forefront with these new systems. As you drive, a network of sensors and smart software helps keep your lane changes smooth, your following distances steady and your ride free from abrupt surprises. These advances can give you peace of mind, but it's essential to remember that these systems don't drive for you. You still need to stay alert and keep your hands ready.",
      "With more cars using similar technology each year, the roads themselves are changing. There's hope that fewer accidents caused by distraction or delayed reactions will benefit not just tech-savvy drivers, but everyone out there. While these models, like the Lucid Air, showcase what's possible, the real transformation comes as driver-assistance features become the new normal in cars everywhere.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Lucid's new hands-free driving update puts it in direct competition with Tesla, GM, and other automakers working to change the way we drive. With DreamDrive Pro, Lucid shows that combining advanced hardware, in-house software, and frequent updates can deliver real capability. As more companies roll out similar systems, drivers are getting more options, and the convenience once reserved for luxury models is becoming more accessible.",

Antivirus software and firewalls cannot fix all of these problems.

A year later, researchers found that 73% of those who followed up with echocardiograms were indeed diagnosed with SHD, a rate far above average. These groundbreaking results were published in Nature, one of the world's most respected scientific journals. That's not just a better test. That's a potential lifesaver.",

      "Millions walk around every day with SHD and have no idea. They skip heart screenings because nothing feels wrong. Even when they do get an ECG, subtle warning signs can slip by unnoticed. EchoNext doesn't miss them. And it doesn't get tired or distracted. This isn't about replacing doctors. Iit's about giving them a powerful new tool to catch what humans alone can't.",

      "The world's first hybrid solar cargo ship has just launched in Germany, marking a major milestone for sustainable shipping. The Blue Marlin uses advanced solar technology not only to power its onboard systems but also to drive its main propulsion, setting a new standard for eco-friendly cargo transport. By combining solar panels with a diesel-electric system, this vessel is paving the way for cleaner, more efficient movement of goods along Germany's waterways.",

      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "How solar power moves the Blue Marlin",
      "The Blue Marlin uses 192 solar panels, which can generate up to 35 kilowatts in ideal conditions. That\u2019s enough to charge over 1,400 smartphones at the same time. Wattlab designed the solar system to supply electricity directly to the ship\u2019s propulsion system. Unlike earlier vessels, the Blue Marlin uses solar energy for movement, not just for basic onboard functions. When conditions allow, the ship can run on solar power alone for short trips. For example, it can do this when traveling downstream with a light load.",
      "Hybrid technology for reliable shipping",
      "The Blue Marlin also relies on four diesel generators. This hybrid setup lets the vessel switch between solar and diesel-electric power as needed. As a result, the ship stays reliable in any weather. An automated energy management system controls how power is distributed. This system sends energy exactly where it is needed. It also reduces unnecessary fuel use, which helps the environment. In addition, the ship uses a technique called peak shaving. During high energy demand, it draws on solar and battery reserves instead of starting extra generators. This strategy lowers emissions and keeps the operation smooth.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "The Blue Martin is well suited for Germany\u2019s waterways",
      "The Blue Marlin measures approximately 282 feet in length and 31 feet in width, with a shallow draft of just 3 feet 7 inches, making it well suited for Germany's canal network. Its hull was constructed in Romania and later outfitted with systems in the Netherlands. Today, the fully completed vessel operates out of Cologne, Germany. SEAFAR remote navigation technology is another feature; this system allows remote-controlled operation on select routes, improving safety and reducing the workload for the crew.",
      "The Blue Marlin\u2019s environmental impact and design benefits",
      "Each year, the Blue Marlin's solar array can generate up to 37,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity. This output helps prevent about 79,000 pounds of CO\u2082 emissions annually. Thanks to its modular design, the ship can connect with push barges and carry up to 3,430 short tons of bulk goods efficiently. Its hybrid diesel-electric system is also designed to run on cleaner fuels in the future, making it adaptable as greener energy options become more available.",
      "The Blue Marlin is the world's first hybrid solar cargo ship. (Wattlab)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Blue Marlin is more than a technological showcase. By fully integrating solar power with intelligent hybrid systems, it proves that performance and environmental responsibility can work together. This vessel stands as a practical example of cleaner shipping solutions. It offers lessons and inspiration for the future of cargo transport around the world.",

    "story": [
      "Microsoft announces the first handheld Xbox device, and it\u2019s primed to take on Nintendo\u2019s best-selling Switch 2.",
      "Windows 11 has had poor adoption, with many people sticking to the good old Windows 10. Microsoft has been pushing users to upgrade, threatening to end software support and warning about potential cybersecurity risks. But Windows 11 isn\u2019t exactly the best OS to come out of Redmond. Even if it were, many people simply can\u2019t upgrade because of its steep system requirements.",
      "In fact, it took Windows 11 nearly four years after its 2021 debut to finally surpass its predecessor in user numbers. Now that Windows 10 is being phased out, many users, especially those with older PCs that don't meet the hardware requirements, are understandably concerned. Tony from Wisconsin recently asked us the same thing:",
      "\"I heard that Microsoft will stop providing security patches for Windows 10 after October. My laptop can't be upgraded to Windows 11 because the CPU is too old. Since I'm not tech-savvy and don't feel comfortable replacing the CPU (nor do I want to), I'm wondering if I have a good antivirus program, do I still need to upgrade? Or will my system still be vulnerable to hackers and viruses?\"",
      "I understand your concern, Tony. Sticking with an unsupported OS brings security risks. Security researchers warn that unsupported systems, such as Windows 10, will become increasingly attractive targets for hackers. Hackers often reverse-engineer patches released for newer systems like Windows 11 to find similar flaws in older ones like Windows 10. With no more fixes coming, those vulnerabilities remain wide open, making unsupported systems a tempting target.",

      "According to Statcounter, Windows 11 has finally overtaken Windows 10 in terms of desktop and laptop usage as of early July. The newer OS now accounts for 52 percent of all Windows installations, up sharply from just under 48 percent in June. In the same period, Windows 10 dropped from 53.2 percent to 44.6 percent. Interestingly, Windows 7 still holds a small but notable presence, with 2.35 percent of users refusing to let it go.",
      "This shift comes nearly four years after Microsoft announced Windows 11 in June 2021. From the start, it was criticized for strict hardware rules. It required a TPM 2.0 chip and newer processors. Many functional PCs were left unable to upgrade.\u00a0 The operating system also introduced a revamped user interface that some users found unnecessary or confusing, leading to a slow adoption rate.",
      "A man typing on a Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens when Windows 10 support ends in 2025? Here's what you need to know",
      "Windows 10 is reaching the end of its official support on October 14, 2025. That means Microsoft will stop releasing new features and routine security updates for the general public. For most users, this marks the end of the road, unless they take specific steps to keep receiving updates.",
      "To extend security updates beyond this deadline, Microsoft is offering a program called Extended Security Updates (ESU). Normally, this would cost $30 per year for personal users. However, Microsoft is making the first year free if you back up your PC using the Windows Backup app and sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "Microsoft hasn't disclosed pricing beyond the first year, so it's unclear whether the $30/year rate will remain the same in 2026 and 2027.",
      "If you don't opt into either of those methods, you'll need to pay the $30 to continue receiving critical patches through October 2026. This is especially relevant for those who can't upgrade to Windows 11 due to hardware limitations.",
      "Even after general support ends, Microsoft will keep updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus on Windows 10 until October 2028. So while full system security updates will stop for most, basic malware protection will continue for a few more years.",
      "Windows laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Can't upgrade to Windows 11? 8 Safe alternatives for Windows 10 users in 2025",
      "You can continue using Windows 10 until October 14, 2025, with full access to regular security and stability updates. After that, you can extend protection by enrolling in Microsoft's Extended Security Updates program. The first year is free if you use the Windows Backup app to sync your settings to OneDrive, or if you redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.",
      "If your computer meets the hardware requirements for Windows 11, upgrading is the easiest long-term solution. You\u2019ll get access to ongoing feature updates, improved security, and long-term support through at least 2031.",
      "Google offers a free operating system called ChromeOS Flex, designed for older PCs and laptops. It\u2019s based on the same system used in Chromebooks and focuses on speed, simplicity, and security. However, it doesn\u2019t support Android apps or some hardware features like fingerprint readers and may not work for tasks like video editing or gaming.. This can be a great option if you mostly use web apps like Gmail, Google Docs, or Zoom.",
      "Linux distributions like Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or Zorin OS provide a stable and user-friendly experience, especially for those coming from Windows. You can use them on older hardware without any licensing fees, and they come with access to thousands of free applications. While there may be a bit of a learning curve, many users find Linux reliable and surprisingly easy to adapt to for everyday tasks like browsing, writing, and media playback.",
      "If your current system can\u2019t handle Windows 11 and you are not interested in alternatives like ChromeOS or Linux, investing in a new computer may be the most straightforward path. New devices come with Windows 11 pre-installed and are built to support it fully. This ensures you\u2019ll continue to receive updates, features, and support for several years without additional effort.",

You could also switch to a different operating system. Another option is investing in stronger security tools. And be on alert: as Windows 10\u2019s end-of-life nears, scammers will take advantage.

      "We all know staying hydrated is important, but most of us don't actually track how much water we need. The signs of dehydration, like dizziness, fatigue, or confusion, can creep in before you even realize you're in trouble. By the time you feel thirsty, you're already behind. That's what makes the new wearable hydration sensor so valuable. Instead of guessing, this device provides real-time data, allowing you to stay ahead of dehydration, rather than just react to it.",

      "Single-side electrode configuration setup using hydration bioimpedance sensor. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "How the wearable hydration sensor works",
      "Developed by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, the sensor is designed to detect early signs of dehydration using a method called bioimpedance. This method sends a small, painless electrical current through your bicep and measures how easily that current flows through your tissue. Because water is a good conductor of electricity, well-hydrated tissue lets the current pass easily. When you're dehydrated, your tissues resist the current, and the sensor detects that. The sensor connects wirelessly to a smartphone app, delivering instant feedback about your hydration level. You don't have to stop what you're doing or wait for lab results. The data is continuous and always available.",
      "Wearable hydration sensor benefits for workouts, jobs, and health",
      "This isn't just cool tech, it's practical. For athletes pushing through workouts in the heat, the sensor could help them avoid fatigue or cramping. For firefighters or police officers wearing heavy gear in scorching temperatures, it offers a way to stay safe on the job. Even office workers who forget to drink water during long meetings could benefit from a reminder when their hydration levels drop. The researchers believe the wearable hydration sensor could also play a major role in health care. Patients with kidney problems or cardiovascular issues often need to monitor hydration closely. Until now, that meant invasive tests or relying on symptoms. This sensor could make hydration tracking simple, accurate, and non-invasive.",
      "The science behind the hydration sensor",
      "To make sure the sensor really works, the research team ran controlled experiments. They had participants take a diuretic to promote fluid loss and tracked hydration using the sensor. At the same time, they collected urine samples to confirm results. The sensor's data closely matched the chemical markers in the samples. That means the technology is not only accurate, but it can also be trusted even during normal daily activities like walking or working. Study co-author Matija Jankovic explained that arm bioimpedance was highly sensitive to changes in hydration. It also aligned with whole-body hydration, making it a reliable alternative to traditional testing.",
      "Rigid PCB and commercial gel electrode system. (University of Texas at Austin)",
      "Traditional hydration tests fall short",
      "Standard ways of checking hydration, like urine tests or blood work, are time-consuming and not practical for everyday use. Some commercial tools already exist, but they tend to be bulky or require users to stay in one spot. They're just not built for real life. That's where this sensor has the edge. It's compact, portable, and constantly running in the background. It works while you move, exercise, or even just sit at your desk.",
      "What's next for hydration tracking",
      "Right now, the sensor tracks relative changes in hydration, which is a powerful tool on its own. But the research team wants to take it further. They plan to collect data from a larger population to create baseline values for absolute hydration levels. This step would make the device even more accurate and personal. They're also exploring new wearable designs, such as breathable e-tattoos and sweat-wicking sensors, that could offer better comfort and longer wear. Future models might track hydration in other areas of the body, like the forearm or thigh. The team is optimistic that these innovations will make hydration tracking even more seamless and accessible. Lead researcher Nanshu Lu, who has worked on similar wearable health tech in the past, says this is only the beginning. Her vision is to bring simple, real-time hydration tracking to everyone, no matter their lifestyle or profession.",
      "A woman sweating during a workout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Staying hydrated just got a whole lot easier. With a wearable hydration sensor, you no longer have to rely on guesswork or vague reminders to drink water. Whether you're powering through a workout, focused on a demanding job, or just caught up in a busy day, this device keeps tabs on your hydration status in real time. That means you get clear, instant feedback-before dehydration slows you down.",
      "While this technology is still in the research and development phase, the early results are promising. It's not yet available to the public, but the groundwork is in place. Once it moves into production, this kind of real-time hydration tracking could become a part of daily life, helping you stay healthier, more alert, and ahead of the curve.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Dehydration isn't always obvious, but it can quickly become serious. The wearable hydration sensor puts the power to monitor your health back in your hands. It's accurate, non-invasive, and built for daily life. Whether you're training for a marathon or just trying to stay sharp at work, knowing your hydration status in real time could make all the difference.",

      "What is the coffee ring effect, and why does it matter in science?",
      "Ever wondered why spilled coffee, wine or tea dries in a ring rather than evenly? This common pattern is known as the \"coffee ring effect.\" The phenomenon occurs because of the liquid's surface tension. As the drop begins to dry, water at the edges evaporates more quickly since that area is thinner. To keep up, liquid from the center flows outward, carrying tiny particles with it. Once the drop is completely dry, these particles settle along the edge, creating the signature ring stain you see on tables and countertops every day.",

Researchers at UC Berkeley transformed this everyday nuisance into a powerful new at-home diagnostic test. This innovative test can identify diseases like COVID-19, prostate cancer and sepsis with remarkable accuracy. In fact, it is up to 100 times more sensitive than many current rapid tests. Even better, it delivers results in just twelve minutes, depending on the test.",
      "The idea began with Kamyar Behrouzi, a former Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. While developing a COVID-19 biosensor in 2020, he noticed that virus particles, much like coffee particles, tend to gather at the edge of a droplet. By using this natural effect, the researchers designed a test that captures and concentrates disease markers, making detection much easier. Thanks to this stain-inspired science, fast and reliable testing is now possible right at home.",

      "How this coffee-inspired test detects COVID-19, sepsis, and more",
      "So, how does this innovative test actually work? First, you place a small sample from your nose or cheek onto a special membrane. As the sample dries, disease proteins concentrate at the edges to form a visible ring. Next, you add a second droplet containing light-reactive particles. If certain disease biomarkers are present, these nanoparticles light up when exposed to light. You can see positive results with the naked eye in some cases, or verify them more accurately using a special AI-powered smartphone app.",
      "This rapid test does more than detect COVID-19. It can also identify early signs of sepsis, a life-threatening infection that needs quick treatment. To make home testing accessible, the UC Berkeley team even created a 3D-printed prototype for easy use on your kitchen counter. According to professor Liwei Lin, this innovative approach could transform regular health screening, with no lab visit required.",

We have a policy that says you can\u2019t fly during Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR). We have a policy that says you can\u2019t fly in restricted airspace.

      "Inspired by President Donald Trump\u2019s leadership style, Kamiya\u2019s rise has largely been attributed to his social media savvy. He snagged his earliest followers through his opposition to \"blanket mask mandates, mass PCR testing, and vaccine requirements\" during the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan Forward reported.",

      "Another possible friction point in the future might be Sanseit\u014d\u2019s desire to turn the nation\u2019s farmers into public sector employees, Gatling admitted. \"The agriculture bloc is one of the most powerful in the LDP,\" he explained. \"I\u2019m not sure how many of the farmers want to be public sector employees.\"",

      "\"To that end the global terror threat index scores for several African countries have come to exceed those of traditional Middle Eastern terror staples.

      "\"A third pillar of the strategy is that Iran has deepened diplomatic and economic cooperation ties with scores of African governments and business organizations to win trade and investment deals that help it evade global sanctions, as well as securing the diplomatic support of African governments on global fora such as the U.N., for measures ranging from its nuclear weapons program to its investment in proxy forces that threaten Israel.",

      "\"That's something Trump's not going to tolerate,\" Fleitz added. \"We will see this is just the first six months of the Trump presidency. This may take a couple of years to solve.\"",

      "\"But Trump also specified something very important. He said to his supporters, 'I came up with a concept of the America-first approach to U.S. national security, and I decide what's in it,\" Fleitz added. \"He has ownership of this approach, and he will adjust if necessary.\"",

      "\"Ukraine shouldn\u2019t be restricted merely to shooting down \u2018arrows\u2019,\" Hardie said. \"An optimal approach will combine both offense and defense. Ukraine needs to be able to hit the \u2018archer\u2019 and the factories that make the \u2018arrows.'",
      "\"Putin will continue his unprovoked war so long as he believes it\u2019s sustainable and offers a pathway to achieving his goals,\" Hardie argued. \"By shoring up Ukraine\u2019s defense of its skies and enabling Ukraine to inflict growing costs on Russia\u2019s war machine, as well as pressuring the Russian economy and exhausting Russia\u2019s offensive potential on the ground, we may be able to change that calculus.\"",

      "The alert comes as deaths from starvation in the enclave continue to rise amid a spiraling hunger crisis spurred by Israel\u2019s military offensive and crippling aid restrictions.",
      "President Donald Trump on Monday echoed mounting global alarm at the situation, which he said amounted to \u201creal starvation\u201d \u2014 a break with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "\u201cImmediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response,\u201d the IPC said. \u201cThis is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.\u201d",

      "The report marked the most dire warning yet from the IPC on the hunger crisis unfolding in Gaza.",
      "Its findings come after weeks of warnings from humanitarian groups and health workers on the ground of starvation spreading in the enclave, with NBC News\u2019 crew witnessing parents grieving over the bodies of their malnourished babies, and frail children clinging to life as they receive hospital care.",
      "Global outrage has reached a crescendo over the spiraling humanitarian situation, with Israel accused of causing a manmade crisis after allowing only a basic amount of aid into the enclave for weeks since lifting a crippling blockade in May that barred the entry of food and other vital supplies into the territory.",
      "The World Food Programme warned Monday that a third of the population in the enclave was \u201cnot eating for days,\u201d with some 470,000 people enduring \u201cfamine-like conditions\u201d and around 90,000 women and children in need of \u201curgent nutrition treatment.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, more than 1,000 people have been killed in recent weeks by Israeli forces during desperate attempts to reach what limited aid is being distributed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave, largely under a widely condemned new distribution system led by the U.S. and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "In the face of mounting condemnation, the Israeli military began limited pauses in fighting over the weekend in three populated areas of Gaza for 10 hours a day to allow the entry and distribution of aid in the enclave by humanitarian groups \u2014 but aid organizations have warned the trickle of aid allowed in so far was not enough to stave off famine in the enclave.",
      "The health ministry in Gaza said Monday that nearly 150 people in Gaza had died from malnutrition since the war began, including at least 88 children.",
      "The total number of people been killed in Gaza since the war began has almost reached 60,000, including thousands of children, according to the health ministry.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, Israel has faced mounting allegations of genocide over its assault on Gaza, including in an ongoing case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice. On Monday, two prominent Israeli rights groups, B\u2019Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, echoed the allegation, concluding that their country was committing genocide.",

    "story": [
      "A new reality is settling in for the global economy: President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are here to stay.",
      "On Monday morning, Trump said the baseline tariff rate for the world will be \u201cin the range of 15 to 20% ... probably one of those two numbers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be setting a tariff for essentially the rest of the world, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to pay if they want to do business in the United States, because you can\u2019t sit down and make 200 deals,\u201d Trump added.",
      "That statement came some 12 hours after Trump announced an agreement Sunday with the European Union that would see a 15% tax paid on products brought into the United States from the bloc. The E.U. also agreed to spend $750 billion on energy purchases from the U.S., while investing an additional $600 billion here.",
      "Before Trump took office for a second time, imports from the E.U. were taxed at an average effective rate of about 1.2%.",
      "In making tariffs a cornerstone of his administration, Trump is upending the decades-old Washington consensus around free trade. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump hinted at a 10% baseline tariff, with higher duties on Chinese goods. But the final levels he\u2019s rolled out \u2014 even with recently announced bilateral deals, and with more possibly in the offing \u2014 are the highest in nearly a century, according to The Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "Those higher tariffs make it nearly certain that American households will pay higher prices for the everyday goods that are made overseas and purchased in the U.S. A Yale estimate from July 23 found that the tariffs will result in as much as $2,700 in lost annual income per household, though the taxes collected would help narrow the long-running federal deficit.",
      "The tariffs that have gone into effect so far are bringing more money into the U.S. Treasury. In June, tariff revenue was $27.2 billion and in May it was $22.8 billion, according to the Treasury Department\u2019s monthly statements, a notable increase from previous years."

The two largest fires, which killed at least 30 people and displaced thousands more, ripped through the communities in  Pacific Palisades and Altadena, fanned by strong Santa Ana winds.",

      "Sweeney, who rose to fame for her starring roles in HBO\u2019s \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cThe White Lotus,\u201d is the star of the clothing retailer\u2019s latest denim-focused fall campaign, with the tagline, \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a play on words for Sweeney\u2019s \u201cgreat genes.\u201d Indeed, in one clip, which accrued more than 1.1 million views on American Eagle\u2019s Instagram page, Sweeney stands before a poster of herself titled, \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes,\u201d before the word \u201cgenes\u201d is crossed out and replaced with \u201cjeans.\u201d",
      "The nod toward her \"genes\" is also made in another video, which further incited backlash from some users on platforms like TikTok, X and Threads who accused American Eagle of promoting eugenics, \u201cwhite supremacy\u201d and \u201cNazi propaganda.\u201d",
      "\u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color,\u201d Sweeney says, before the camera pans up to her blue eyes. \u201cMy jeans are blue.\u201d",
      "A representative for Sweeney declined to comment. American Eagle did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "The discourse has also drawn retaliatory backlash from others online who say the criticisms of the ad campaign are an exaggeration. Some are embracing the political undertone of the ad by hailing it as an end to overly \u201cwoke\u201d marketing campaigns.",
      "It\u2019s the latest controversy to highlight a growing cultural rift over perceived \u201cwokeness\u201d as conservative-leaning culture swings back into the mainstream. In recent years, those on the online right have often praised media that unapologetically upholds traditional white American beauty standards, especially when it doesn\u2019t come with any attempt to be inclusive.",
      "These shifting ideals have been marked by an upswing in trends like the \"old money\" aesthetic, the end of the body positivity movement and the rise of the tradwife lifestyle in popular culture.",
      "When American Eagle announced the collaboration with Sweeney last week, the company\u2019s stock briefly soared.",
      "But after sharing more than a dozen social media posts featuring Sweeney over the past few days, the brand\u2019s latest post on Sunday starred a different model.",

    "story": [
      "At least 60% of liver cancers could be preventable, according to an analysis published Monday in The Lancet.",
      "Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with around 870,000 cases in 2022. That\u2019s projected to increase to 1.52 million cases in 2050, the new report found, if no changes are made.",
      "The leading cause of liver cancer is viral infections, including the hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis B infections \u2014 which are preventable with a vaccine \u2014 accounted for 39% of liver cancers in 2022. That\u2019s expected to fall slightly, to 36.9%, by 2025. Hepatitis C accounted for 29.1% of liver cancers in 2022 and is also projected to fall, to 25.9%, by 2050.",
      "The proportions of alcohol- and obesity-related liver cancers, however, are projected to rise in the next 25 years. Alcohol accounted for 18.8% of liver cancers in 2022, and that is expected to increase to 21.1% in 2050. The share of liver cancers caused by obesity-related disease is projected to increase from 8% to 10.8% by 2050 due to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol and other metabolic risk factors.",
      "Dr. Hashem El-Serag, one of the report\u2019s co-authors and chair of the department of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the public usually thinks of alcohol as the biggest risk factor for liver cancer.",
      "\u201cI think for most people, if you say cirrhosis, they immediately think of a relative, of someone who was a heavy drinker,\u201d El-Serag said. \u201cI think the vast majority do not make the tie between MASLD, or fatty liver, and cirrhosis and liver cancer.\u201d",
      "MASLD, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, affects about 25% of adults in the U.S. It\u2019s caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. About 5% of U.S. adults have a more severe form, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to scarring, or cirrhosis, of the liver, significantly increasing the risk of cancer.",
      "Excess alcohol consumption can also lead to cirrhosis.",
      "Liver cancer is still relatively rare in the United States, representing 2.1% of all new cancer diagnoses in 2025. The report estimated that by 2040, U.S. rates of MASLD could more than double, affecting more than 55% of adults.",
      "Detecting liver cancer risk factors",
      "Earlier detection and effective treatment plans for MASLD can reduce the risk of obesity-related liver cancer, El-Serag said. The most common treatment is weight loss. GLP-1 weight loss drugs, which include Ozempic and Wegovy, are promising, he said. (A clinical trial published in April found that Wegovy treated MASH in about two-thirds of patients.)",
      "However, people aren\u2019t screened for MASLD like they are for viral hepatitis, El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Arun Jesudian, a hepatologist and the director of liver quality and inpatient liver services at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, said patients are tested for MASLD and/or MASH if they have elevated liver enzymes in their blood.",
      "Raising awareness about MASLD among both patients and doctors can lead to more effective testing and diagnosis, Jesudian said.",
      "\u201cI think then we need to make sure that providers who are interacting with these patients are looking at the liver disease component of metabolic syndrome,\u201d he said, referring to patients with a cluster of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure and excess weight. \u201cSo checking liver enzymes, that they know how to assess for fibrosis, even based on these blood test scores.\u201d",
      "MASLD and MASH can often be asymptomatic, making self-detection more challenging.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s haphazard. Some people get tested. Others get suspected. Third, who knows?\u201d El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Neehar Parikh, a hepatologist at the University of Michigan who specializes in liver cancer, said he is seeing more patients with MASLD as a driving factor for liver cancer.",
      "Patients with MASLD can develop liver cancer without developing cirrhosis, making it even more challenging to detect those cases, Parikh said. Up to 40% of those with liver cancers linked to MASLD don\u2019t develop cirrhosis, according to the report.",
      "Figuring out who those patients are is the \u201cmillion-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cThose patients that develop MASLD that develop liver cancer, you know, how do you screen that population? We don\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d",
      "Still, Parikh said these types of cases are rare.",
      "Ultimately, Jesudian said, \u201ctreating these liver diseases early is the best way to prevent liver cancer, because liver cancer almost always occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump on Monday echoed mounting global alarm at the situation, which he said amounted to \u201creal starvation\u201d \u2014 a break with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "\u201cImmediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response,\u201d the IPC said. \u201cThis is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering.\u201d",
      "While the IPC considers itself the \u201cprimary mechanism\u201d used by the international community to conclude whether a famine is happening or projected, it typically doesn\u2019t make such a designation itself. But it said Tuesday that with new information made available, a new IPC analysis had to be conducted \u201cwithout delay.\u201d",
      "The report marked the most dire warning yet from the IPC on the hunger crisis unfolding in Gaza.",
      "Its findings come after weeks of warnings from humanitarian groups and health workers on the ground of starvation spreading in the enclave, with NBC News\u2019 crew witnessing parents grieving over the bodies of their malnourished babies, and frail children clinging to life as they receive hospital care.",
      "Global outrage has reached a crescendo over the spiraling humanitarian situation, with Israel accused of causing a manmade crisis after allowing only a basic amount of aid into the enclave for weeks since lifting a crippling blockade in May that barred the entry of food and other vital supplies into the territory.",
      "The World Food Programme warned Monday that a third of the population in the enclave was \u201cnot eating for days,\u201d with some 470,000 people enduring \u201cfamine-like conditions\u201d and around 90,000 women and children in need of \u201curgent nutrition treatment.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, more than 1,000 people have been killed in recent weeks by Israeli forces during desperate attempts to reach what limited aid is being distributed in Gaza, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave, largely under a widely condemned new distribution system led by the U.S. and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "In the face of mounting condemnation, the Israeli military began limited pauses in fighting over the weekend in three populated areas of Gaza for 10 hours a day to allow the entry and distribution of aid in the enclave by humanitarian groups \u2014 but aid organizations have warned the trickle of aid allowed in so far was not enough to stave off famine in the enclave.",
      "The health ministry in Gaza said Monday that nearly 150 people in Gaza had died from malnutrition since the war began, including at least 88 children.",
      "The total number of people been killed in Gaza since the war began has almost reached 60,000, including thousands of children, according to the health ministry.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, Israel has faced mounting allegations of genocide over its assault on Gaza, including in an ongoing case brought by South Africa before the International Court of Justice. On Monday, two prominent Israeli rights groups, B\u2019Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, echoed the allegation, concluding that their country was committing genocide.",
      "Israel and the U.S. have consistently denied this."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department filed a complaint Monday alleging misconduct by a federal judge overseeing several cases involving the Trump administration, including a challenge to the legality of deportation flights to El Salvador in March.",
      "The complaint against James Boasberg, the chief U.S. district judge in Washington, D.C., which was filed by Attorney General Pam Bondi's chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, alleges that Boasberg made improper comments during a judicial conference in March.",
      "\u201cWhile there,\u201d Mizelle wrote, \u201cJudge\u202fBoasberg attempted to improperly influence Chief Justice Roberts and roughly two dozen other federal judges by straying from the traditional topics to express his belief that the Trump Administration would 'disregard rulings of federal courts' and trigger 'a constitutional crisis.'\"",
      "NBC News hasn\u2019t verified the remarks, which Mizelle said Boasberg made on March 11. The conference wasn\u2019t open to the public.",
      "\u201cAlthough his comments would be inappropriate even if they had some basis, they were even worse because Judge Boasberg had no basis,\u201d Mizelle added in his five-page letter to Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan of the U.S. Circuit of Court of Appeals in Washington.",
      "Mizelle went on to say in the complaint that the Trump administration has complied with \u201call\u201d court orders and that Boasberg didn\u2019t identify any violations of court orders to justify what Mizelle called \u201chis unprecedented predictions.\u201d",
      "Boasberg didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.",
      "Bondi wrote on X, \u201cToday at my direction, @TheJusticeDept filed a misconduct complaint against U.S. District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg for making improper public comments about President Trump and his Administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese comments have undermined the integrity of the judiciary, and we will not stand for that,\u201d she added.",
      "Boasberg is assigned to several notable cases involving the Trump administration, none more high-profile than the Alien Enemies Act case, which was filed in mid-March when three deportation flights took off from the United States en route to El Salvador. During an emergency hearing at the time, Boasberg ordered that any planes that were midair and bound for El Salvador return to the United States after Trump\u2019s executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act for deportations was made public.",
      "He later found cause to initiate contempt proceedings to determine whether the Trump administration was in willful violation of court orders. An appeals court has paused the process, however.",
      "\u201cHaving assumed President Trump would defy court orders, Judge Boasberg issued a [temporary restraining order] and threatened sanctions\u2014all on a false premise,\" the complaint says, noting that Boasberg spoke at the conference days before he ruled from the bench in the deportations case. \"Such conduct violates litigants\u2019 trust in an impartial judiciary and falls below the standards that safeguard the integrity of the judiciary and public confidence in that integrity.\u201d",
      "Mizelle asked Srinivasan to refer the matter to a special investigative committee to determine whether Boasberg\u2019s conduct constituted \u201cconduct prejudicial to the effective and expeditious administration of the business of the courts.\u201d",
      "He also asked that Boasberg\u2019s Alien Enemies Act case be reassigned to another judge while the investigation proceeds and that disciplinary action be imposed, including a public reprimand and referral to the Judicial Conference for consideration of impeachment\u2011related recommendations, if the committee finds willful misconduct."

    "summary": "House Republican proposals to name the Kennedy Center after President Donald Trump and its opera house after Melania Trump would violate the law the center was created under.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republican proposals to name the Kennedy Center after President Donald Trump and its opera house after first lady Melania Trump would violate the law by which the Kennedy Center was created, four sources familiar with the issue told NBC News.",
      "Republicans last week passed an amendment through committee that would rename the opera house after Melania Trump, saying it was a way to recognize her support for and commitment to the arts. The measure, sponsored by GOP Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, is now part of key legislation to fund the Interior Department, but it would still need to pass through the full House and the Senate to become law.",
      "The next day, Rep. Bob Onder, R-Mo., introduced the \u201cMake Entertainment Great Again Act\u201d to rename the whole center the \u201cDonald J. Trump Center for Performing Arts.\u201d The House has not yet taken any action on it.",
      "Three former board members for the Kennedy Center told NBC News that the law creating the center prohibited any of the facilities from being renamed, other than the Eisenhower Theater, after the president whose administration first authorized its construction in 1958. The project stalled and was revived under President John F. Kennedy, whose family led an effort to get the center built and named in his honor following his assassination. Two months later, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the legislation making it a living memorial to Kennedy.",
      "According to U.S. code, \u201cAfter December 2, 1983, no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\u201d",
      "Republicans would have to pass legislation to change that. \u201cLegally, they can\u2019t just slap her name on it without congressional action,\u201d said a spokesperson for Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine, the lead Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on the interior.",
      "\u201cIf Republicans can\u2019t pass their budget \u2014 which they usually can\u2019t \u2014 the Melania Trump renaming provision dies,\u201d the spokesperson continued. \u201cThe only real wildcard is whether Trump or his allies ignore the law entirely and try to do it unilaterally. But that would have no legal basis \u2014 and would almost certainly trigger a court fight.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Simpson said the White House and the first lady's office were not aware of his amendment before he offered it, nor was Trump-appointed Kennedy Center President Ric Grenell. The first lady's office did call Simpson's office to say thank you afterward, the spokesperson said. The White House declined to comment.",
      "Simpson sponsored the amendment because \"he understands that the first lady has always been a very avid supporter of the arts as well. She\u2019s had a long-standing commitment to the arts. ... It really did come from his heart.\u201d",
      "As for the chance the amendment could die in the appropriations process, the Simpson spokesperson said it could \u201cdefinitely\u201d make it through in a short-term funding bill, known as a \"continuing resolution,\" later in the year.",
      "The first lady is the honorary chair of the center, following tradition. But in a striking departure from their practice during the first Trump term, when they did not attend events there, reacting to widespread criticism of his policies by prominent artists, this year the president has shown a great interest in the arts. He has named himself the Kennedy Center chairman and fired the previous bipartisan Board of Trustees, along with its veteran president, Deborah Rutter, and its chairman, David M. Rubenstein. Rubenstein had donated $111 million and was the center\u2019s biggest individual donor, the center said.",
      "Trump replaced Rutter with Grenell, his White House special envoy and former ambassador to Germany. Trump wrote on social media that Grenell \u201cshares my Vision for a GOLDEN AGE of American Arts and Culture\u201d and would ensure there was no more \u201cANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA.\u201d",
      "In particular, Trump objected to a drag show, which he found offensive, among the 2,200 events the Kennedy Center typically produces in a year. He also told reporters on Air Force One in February, \u201cWe don\u2019t need woke at the Kennedy Center.\u201d",
      "In addition to firing 18 of the 36 board members whom President Joe Biden appointed for six-year terms, the Trump administration has ordered different programming. Notably, there are also now four large portraits of the first and second couples in the center\u2019s Hall of Nations, the main entryway to the facility. Until this year, the public spaces included only a bronze bust of President John F. Kennedy.",
      "Trump\u2019s recently enacted domestic spending bill also included more than $250 million to renovate the facility, more than six times the previous $43 million federal subsidy that was earmarked for operations and maintenance, not programming. The center also removed all references to diversity, equity and inclusion from its website.",
      "The opera house, with more than 2,300 seats, is the center\u2019s second-largest theater and the venue for the institution\u2019s signature annual concert for cultural honorees, the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 a formal event and major fundraiser launched in 1978 and attended by all the former first couples, except the Trumps, and recorded every December for broadcast by CBS. The gala, star-studded weekend in the nation\u2019s capital every holiday season has, in the past, always included a Sunday afternoon awards ceremony hosted by the president and the first lady at the White House and a celebratory Saturday night dinner at the State Department hosted by the secretary of state.",
      "During his first term, the Trumps did not host the Sunday ceremony or attend the concert after some of the honorees said they would not attend the White House event in opposition to some of the Trump policies and his controversial comments about the white nationalist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, that year. Past honorees have included a broad spectrum of actors, musicians and other performers.",
      "The Trumps attended a performance of \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d in the opera house in June, and some members of the audience booed their arrival. Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, were also booed when attending a concert by the National Symphony Orchestra.",
      "President Kennedy\u2019s grandson Jack Schlossberg posted strong criticism of the opera house\u2019s renaming proposal last week. Schlossberg, Caroline Kennedy\u2019s son, wrote, \u201cJFK believed the arts made our country great and could be our most effective weapon in the fight for civil rights and against authoritarian governments around the world,\u201d adding, \u201cThe Trump administration stands for freedom of oppression, not expression.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "At least 60% of liver cancers could be preventable, according to an analysis published Monday in The Lancet.",
      "Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with around 870,000 cases in 2022. That\u2019s projected to increase to 1.52 million cases in 2050, the new report found, if no changes are made.",
      "The leading cause of liver cancer is viral infections, including the hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis B infections \u2014 which are preventable with a vaccine \u2014 accounted for 39% of liver cancers in 2022. That\u2019s expected to fall slightly, to 36.9%, by 2025. Hepatitis C accounted for 29.1% of liver cancers in 2022 and is also projected to fall, to 25.9%, by 2050.",
      "The proportions of alcohol- and obesity-related liver cancers, however, are projected to rise in the next 25 years. Alcohol accounted for 18.8% of liver cancers in 2022, and that is expected to increase to 21.1% in 2050. The share of liver cancers caused by obesity-related disease is projected to increase from 8% to 10.8% by 2050 due to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol and other metabolic risk factors.",
      "Dr. Hashem El-Serag, one of the report\u2019s co-authors and chair of the department of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the public usually thinks of alcohol as the biggest risk factor for liver cancer.",
      "\u201cI think for most people, if you say cirrhosis, they immediately think of a relative, of someone who was a heavy drinker,\u201d El-Serag said. \u201cI think the vast majority do not make the tie between MASLD, or fatty liver, and cirrhosis and liver cancer.\u201d",
      "MASLD, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, affects about 25% of adults in the U.S. It\u2019s caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. About 5% of U.S. adults have a more severe form, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to scarring, or cirrhosis, of the liver, significantly increasing the risk of cancer.",
      "Excess alcohol consumption can also lead to cirrhosis.",
      "Liver cancer is still relatively rare in the United States, representing 2.1% of all new cancer diagnoses in 2025. The report estimated that by 2040, U.S. rates of MASLD could more than double, affecting more than 55% of adults.",
      "Detecting liver cancer risk factors",
      "Earlier detection and effective treatment plans for MASLD can reduce the risk of obesity-related liver cancer, El-Serag said. The most common treatment is weight loss. GLP-1 weight loss drugs, which include Ozempic and Wegovy, are promising, he said. (A clinical trial published in April found that Wegovy treated MASH in about two-thirds of patients.)",
      "However, people aren\u2019t screened for MASLD like they are for viral hepatitis, El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Arun Jesudian, a hepatologist and the director of liver quality and inpatient liver services at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, said patients are tested for MASLD and/or MASH if they have elevated liver enzymes in their blood.",
      "Raising awareness about MASLD among both patients and doctors can lead to more effective testing and diagnosis, Jesudian said.",
      "\u201cI think then we need to make sure that providers who are interacting with these patients are looking at the liver disease component of metabolic syndrome,\u201d he said, referring to patients with a cluster of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure and excess weight. \u201cSo checking liver enzymes, that they know how to assess for fibrosis, even based on these blood test scores.\u201d",
      "MASLD and MASH can often be asymptomatic, making self-detection more challenging.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s haphazard. Some people get tested. Others get suspected. Third, who knows?\u201d El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Neehar Parikh, a hepatologist at the University of Michigan who specializes in liver cancer, said he is seeing more patients with MASLD as a driving factor for liver cancer.",
      "Patients with MASLD can develop liver cancer without developing cirrhosis, making it even more challenging to detect those cases, Parikh said. Up to 40% of those with liver cancers linked to MASLD don\u2019t develop cirrhosis, according to the report.",
      "Figuring out who those patients are is the \u201cmillion-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cThose patients that develop MASLD that develop liver cancer, you know, how do you screen that population? We don\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d",
      "Still, Parikh said these types of cases are rare.",
      "Ultimately, Jesudian said, \u201ctreating these liver diseases early is the best way to prevent liver cancer, because liver cancer almost always occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease.\u201d"

      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "A legislative assistant to House Common Education Committee Chairman Dick Lowe, Caitlin Kilpatrick, pointed NBC News to reporting by the news outlet NonDoc that said Lowe attended the meeting. Lowe told the publication that while he didn\u2019t see the video of the naked women, he discussed the matter with the two board members who did view the images.",
      "\u201cShocked would be maybe an understatement a little bit. In the position that that person is in, that\u2019s absolutely without a question not appropriate by any means for any state official, much less that state official,\u201d Lowe told NonDoc.",
      "Walters, a conservative Republican, characterized the accounts from Deatherage and Carson as \"politically motivated attacks\" in a statement Monday.",
      "\"These are desperate lies from a broken establishment terrified of real change,\" he added.",
      "Walters has pushed for proposals to further integrate religion in schools, such as placing Bibles in them. He has also advocated for requiring students enrolled in state public schools to provide proof of U.S. citizenship.",
      "In an earlier statement after the allegations surrounding the meeting arose, Walters denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\"Any suggestion that a device of mine was used to stream inappropriate content on the television set is categorically false. I have no knowledge of what was on the TV screen during the alleged incident, and there is absolutely no truth to any implication of wrongdoing,\" Walters said Sunday on X.",
      "Deatherage, Carson and the four other members of the Board of Education, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "State House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, a Republican, called the allegations \"serious,\" and said that \"an expeditious third-party review is warranted.\"",
      "\"I urge the State Superintendent to unlock and turn over all relevant devices and fully cooperate with an investigation. If no wrongdoing occurred, a prompt and transparent review should quickly clear his name,\u201d Hilbert said in a statement Monday.",
      "State House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, a Democrat, said in a statement Monday that the Democratic Caucus has made six calls over the last two years requesting a special bipartisan committee to investigate Walters about other matters.",
      "\"Before these recent allegations came out, he has shown multiple times throughout his leadership that he has no interest in bettering the public education system for students and teachers. He is mainly concerned with advancing his own political and religious agendas,\" she said.",
      "\"These new allegations are serious and troubling, and while we wait for the investigation to be finished, I think it\u2019s prudent to acknowledge that there has been a dire need for change in leadership at the Oklahoma State Department of Education for a long time.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s attorney Monday renewed his request that the Supreme Court overturn her 2021 conviction in New York for recruiting and grooming multiple teenage girls for Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse for over a decade.",
      "In a new filing, Maxwell's lawyer, David Oscar Markus, repeated arguments he made in previous filings that a non-prosecution agreement Epstein made with federal prosecutors in Florida should apply to Maxwell\u2019s case in New York and any other part of the United States.",
      "The filing includes no new information about Maxwell\u2019s two days of meetings last week with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.",
      "Maxwell's lawyer asked the Supreme Court to take up her case in April. Markus argues that the Supreme Court should hear the case because there is disagreement in the federal courts over whether a non-prosecution agreement applies only to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office that signs it or to federal prosecutors nationwide.",
      "Justice Department lawyers responded earlier this month in a filing of their own and urged the court not to consider the case. Monday's filing from Markus contained his response to the government's arguments.",
      "The Supreme Court, which is on its summer recess, is unlikely to act on Maxwell\u2019s case for months.",
      "Federal prosecutors have argued that the agreement applies only to southern Florida, where it was made. The federal judge who oversaw Maxwell\u2019s 2021 trial in New York, Judge Alison Nathan, agreed.",
      "Nathan wrote in a ruling that a Justice Department review found that no special promises were made to Maxwell that she would not be prosecuted federally outside South Florida. Markus argued that Maxwell did receive those assurances.",
      "\u201cThis case is about what the government promised, not what Epstein did,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPlea agreements are supposed to be strictly construed against the government, yet here the government isn\u2019t even asking for the benefit of the doubt; it is asking for a blank check to rewrite its own promise after the fact.\u201d",
      "Nathan also noted in her 2021 ruling that the Florida non-prosecution agreement covered Epstein\u2019s criminal activity from 2001 to 2007. Maxwell was prosecuted in New York for her conduct from 1994 to 1997, \u201csome four years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation.\u201d",
      "Markus said in a statement that he was appealing to both the Supreme Court and President Donald Trump for help with Maxwell's case. The Supreme Court could overturn Maxwell's conviction in New York and order a new federal trial. Trump could commute Maxwell's sentence or pardon her.",
      "\"President Trump built his legacy in part on the power of a deal,\" Markus said. \"And surely he would agree that when the United States gives its word, it must stand by it.\"",
      "\"We are appealing not only to the Supreme Court,\" he added, \"but to the President himself to recognize how profoundly unjust it is to scapegoat Ghislaine Maxwell for Epstein\u2019s crimes, especially when the government promised she would not be prosecuted.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Sydney Sweeney's recent partnership with American Eagle Outfitters has generated substantial online criticism.",
      "The ad campaign, which focuses on the company\u2019s new line of denim products, is centered around the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans\" \u2014 and people have a lot to say about the slogan's messaging.",
      "Chatter surrounding the collaboration has added the brand to a growing list of companies experiencing \u201cmeme stock\u201d booms, CNBC reported, or a stock that gains popularity through social media. After the initiative debuted, shares of the company\u2019s stock jumped more than 4%.",
      "So, why are people talking about the ad? Here is everything you need to know.",
      "What do the Sydney Sweeney ads for American Eagle depict?",
      "In American Eagle\u2019s fall campaign, Sydney Sweeney shows off the company\u2019s latest collection of denim.",
      "Videos from the promotion focus on the \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star's denim-clad body as she lounges with a puppy, fixes a car and buttons up a pair of over-sized jeans.",
      "\u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign\u2019s slogan booms at the end of each clip as a play on the words \u201cgenes\u201d and \u201cjeans.\u201d",
      "The ads play up the homophone \"good jeans\" and \"good genes.\"",
      "\u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My genes are blue,\u201d Sweeney says in one ad as the camera pans her body while she buttons a pair of jeans.",
      "Another print ad spells out, \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes,\u201d but crosses out the \u201cgenes\u201d and writes in \u201cjeans.\u201d",
      "The collection features over 200 fits of jeans and over 50 new styles. In the campaign announcement, President and Executive Creative Director at American Eagle explains Sweeney\u2019s role in the ad.",
      "\u201cWith Sydney Sweeney front and center, she brings the allure, and we add the flawless wardrobe for the winning combo of ease, attitude and a little mischief,\u201d the announcement reads.",
      "Why is the ad campaign causing controversy?",
      "The campaign has stirred up mixed opinions on the internet, raising questions about its intent and implications.",
      "For some, the campaign\u2019s central messaging about genes uphold outdated and harmful standards of beauty, and even promote eugenic ideals.",
      "Eugenics is an evolutionary theory aimed to select \u201cdesired heritable characteristics in order to improve future generations,\u201d according to Encyclopedia Britannica. The movement has a long history, but in the U.S., it historically used \"genetic superiority\" as justification for white supremacy.",
      "The ad\u2019s messaging surrounding \u201cgood genes\u201d feels like a wink to eugenic ideals.",
      "\u201cThem choosing \u2018Sydney Sweeney has great genes\u2019 was not an accident,\u201d one user said in a TikTok video that received over one million views. \u201cIt\u2019s a dog whistle towards the rise of people who are wanting to see more people who look like them everywhere.\u201d",
      "A representative for Sweeney declined to comment to NBC News. American Eagle did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cheryl Overton, Chief Experience Officer at integrated marketing communications firm Cheryl Overton Communications, says context is important. The promotion \u201cdoesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum,\u201d she says. Instead, it occurs in \u201ca country actively grappling with social standards rooted in whiteness.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe subtext isn\u2019t imagined; it\u2019s rooted in centuries-old narrative about one archetype of beauty that is seen as genetically superior or \u2018aspirational,\u201d Overton tells TODAY.com.",
      "While the ad never references race, Hillary Herskowitz, CEO and Founder of H2 Marketing Group, tells TODAY.com there is \u201cno denying\u201d that the phrase \u201ccarries historical baggage.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you pair that kind of wordplay with a blond, blue-eyed actress, it can unintentionally reinforce narrow, Eurocentric beauty standards,\u201d she adds.",
      "Whether this implication is purposeful is up for debate.",
      "Overton says the messaging could be the result of a \u201cblind spot of a team lacking cultural fluency\u201d or a \u201cbrand looking actively to cull consumers who value diversity from its base.\u201d",
      "Herskowitz sees the ad as being designed to provoke a reaction.",
      "\u201cIntentional,\u201d Herskowitz says. \u201cThat line \u2014 \u2018good jeans\u2019 \u2014 is too perfectly constructed not to be. It was designed to be cheeky, playful and buzzworthy. The creative team knew exactly what they were doing.\"",
      "Adrienne Alexander, owner of the PR firm IPY Agency, points out the extensive process campaigns like this go through, and says multiple teams likely signed off on the language.",
      "\u201cCampaigns like this go through many hands, including creative, legal, PR, and brand strategy, so it\u2019s unlikely that no one flagged the potential issue. More likely, the team underestimated the reaction or saw it as a playful pun rather than a loaded phrase. Either way, the responsibility remains the same: if you spark a conversation, be prepared to own it and respond accordingly,\u201d she says.",
      "The ad has also garnered criticism for sexualizing Sweeney. Some say the ad\u2019s close-up shots of the actor seem to objectify her and cater to the male gaze.",
      "\u201cAre we selling jeans to women or selling women in jeans to men?\u201d one user commented on American Eagle\u2019s Instagram.",
      "The limited edition Sydney Jean, produced with Sweeney, has a butterfly motif on the back pocket representing domestic violence awareness, per a press release from the company, and the entirety of the purchase price will be donated to the Crisis Text Line.",
      "Marketing professor Melissa Murphy calls the juxtaposition of the sexual nature of the ads, plus the domestic violence tie-in, \"mismatched\" tonally.",
      "Some viewers have also pointed out that the ad feels reminiscent of a controversial Calvin Klein campaign from 1980 featuring a teenage Brooke Shields.",
      "\u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing,\u201d the then 15-year-old model said in the ad as the camera panned her entire body.",
      "The moment caused an uproar for holding sexual implications and taking advantage of the young star. Shields later spoke out about the moment, saying she was unaware of the ad\u2019s meaning.",
      "Like the Calvin Klein ad, which Klein once said put the company on the map, American Eagle has seen increased chatter following the campaign\u2019s debut.",
      "According to Herskowitz, controversy can \u201cdrive brand momentum.\u201d But was the controversy intentional?",
      "Murphy, doubts it, and so calls the ad campaign, and its lack of diversity, a \u201cmiss.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey should have done (the ad) with multiple people \u2014 that would definitely resonate better,\u201d she says. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t more, and this is just it, then that\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d"

We started this show nearly six years ago, and Clay\u2019s become a dear friend, so there\u2019s an element of genuine sadness because these two characters will never interact anymore. In a way, though, that echoes Oscar\u2019s own vision of his future self with John being cut short so dramatically and abruptly.\""

      "The show, starring Rhea Seehorn, already been picked up for two seasons by Apple TV+.",

      "What is Vince Gilligan\u2019s New Show About?",
      "While Apple TV+ is keeping tight-lipped about the exact plot, Gilligan has teased that this show is a psychological sci-fi drama set in a reimagined version of modern-day Albuquerque, where the world shifts drastically in the very first episode. The show won\u2019t revisit cartels or criminal empires, but it\u2019s still designed to mess with your mind (in the best way).",
      "Gilligan told Deadline the series will \u201cbend reality\u201d by exploring human nature through a character-driven, philosophical lens, likening the tone to \"The Twilight Zone.\" Expect a world that feels familiar but isn\u2019t quite right.",
      "And though it avoids the crime underbelly that defined his earlier work, longtime fans can still expect Gilligan\u2019s signature touches: moral tension, complex characters and flashes of dark, unexpected humor.",
      "This time, though, the angle is more hopeful. \u201cAfter 15 years of antiheroes,\u201d Gilligan said, \u201cI figured it was time to write something about someone trying to be good.\u201d",
      "Who Is in Vince Gilligan\u2019s New Show?",
      "Right now, Rhea Seehorn is the confirmed lead. The Emmy-nominated actor, best known for her breakout role as Kim Wexler in \"Better Call Saul,\" is joined by Karolina Wydra, who will play Ana, a character described as optimistic (though knowing Gilligan, we can expect that might not last long).",
      "Seehorn recently shared her excitement about the project with Deadline, saying, \u201cIt really swings for the fences. I had so much fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome of the stuff that audiences have loved about (Gilligan\u2019s) writing: really rich characters, playing with tropes and genres, injecting humor into very dark moments. In this new show, he pushes that to a limit that was both very thought-provoking and upsetting sometimes, and other times, so, so funny,\u201d she added.",
      "In another interview with The Hollywood Reporter, she revealed that Gilligan wrote the role specifically for her \u2014 and that it\u2019s \u201cextremely unlike anything I\u2019ve ever done before.\u201d The character, described as a \u201cdamaged but well-intentioned hero,\u201d offers a departure from her past work.",
      "Additional casting details are still under wraps, but the project is already reuniting Gilligan with several of his longtime collaborators both on and off screen. More familiar faces could still be on the way \u2014 and fans are definitely watching closely.",
      "Is There a Trailer?",
      "Yes, and it\u2019s as weird and wonderful as fans might hope.",
      "The first teaser for \"Pluribus,\" released on July 25, 2025, opens with a woman (not Seehorn) slowly licking donuts in what appears to be an office or factory setting.",
      "The camera then pans to a sign that reads \u201cHelp Yourself,\u201d signed with a hand-drawn smiley face before revealing the show\u2019s title.",
      "The smiley face has been part of the show's ads before. On July 22, streamer shared a cryptic post on X featuring a petri dish with an eerie smile, captioned \u201cHappiness is Contagious.\u201d",
      "Combined with the teaser\u2019s surreal tone, fans are already speculating that this unsettling smile may be central to the show\u2019s mystery.",

      "\"We wanted to give her that opportunity as she gets older and kind of matures and decides whether or not she wants to go by Kelce or Kels, or even if she's more like tomboy-ish, she can go by KT,\" Richardson says. \"We wanted to give her lots of options with her name as she grows up and becomes her own person.\"",
      "Their daughter's middle name, Taylor-Grace, in true Swift fashion, contains another Easter egg, Dillon says.",
      "\"TG in the middle \u2014\u00a0Tony Gonzalez was my first favorite football player, so we kind of snuck that in there as well,\" he says.",
      "As for why they picked Taylor, Richardson says after learning more about the singer since her relationship with Travis Kelce began, she's become a fan.",
      "\"I really grew to love her as a human being, more than just the superstar that she is,\" Richardson says.",
      "She cites Swift's well-publicized philanthropy, including her donations to local charities during the \"Eras Tour\" and the $100,000 bonus checks she gave her truck drivers.",
      "\"I really wanted Kelce to have that ... be able to (say), 'Oh this is who I'm named after. Maybe that's a good person that I should look up to,'\" Richardson says.",

(\"I am flattered that people think my baby is Taylor Swift's baby,\" Richardson says with a laugh.)",
      "Some commenters have also asked the question: What if Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce break up?",
      "\"They're still two people at the top of their respective fields,\" Richardson says. \"So honestly, we didn't even think about it. It doesn't matter to us whether or not they break up. We just wanted to give her people to look up to.\""

      "\u201cTo have that person that unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there\u2019s no better feeling in the world,\u201d he continued. \u201cI got the most incredible wife.

And it didn\u2019t matter, because I knew what I had to give was so much greater and even beyond me.\"",

    "story": [
      "In FX\u2019s \u201cAdults,\u201d Owen Thiele plays Anton, the \u201cfriend slut\u201d of the group.",
      "Episode 3 of the Gen Z take on the \u201ceclectic group of New York City roommates trope\u201d sees the 20-something crew deal with a stabber in their Queens neighborhood. And the wanted sign posted on their block features the suspect smiling and waving to none other than one of their own.",
      "Anton and the alleged stabber had exchanged phone numbers and made weekly dinner plans. After, his roommates force him to go through his texts, where they find hundreds of chummy brief exchanges with contacts like, \u201cBriana Acupuncture Student\u201d or \u201cLeather jacket Newsies chorus.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe phone episode is very me,\u201d Thiele tells TODAY.com. \u201cTo the point where I was like, we might as well just use my real phone.\u201d",
      "Thiele has previously called himself a \u201cnepo friend,\u201d due to his past experience landing roles in projects created by his friends. For example: Thiele went to high school with \u201cTheater Camp\u201d writer and star Molly Gordon before playing head of costumes Gigi Charbonier in 2023. Before 2025\u2019s \u201cOvercompensating,\u201d series\u2019 creator Benito Skinner \u2014 who wrote the show in part based on his own early 2010s college experience \u2014 was \u201calready my best friend,\u201d Thiele says.",
      "But with \u201cAdults,\u201d an eight-episode comedy series helmed by executive producer Nick Kroll, Thiele landed a starring role, building a character he could \u201cinfuse\u201d himself into and becoming one-half of one of entertainment\u2019s most beloved phenomena: the sitcom ship.",
      "\u201cNick Kroll did a fake out where he told us that we were getting on a Zoom to do another round of auditions, but really it was to tell us that we got the role \u2014 it was that moment where I was like, \u2018I actually booked something, not through a friend who I forced to put me in something,\u2019\u201d Thiele says.",
      "\u201cThat was the moment that I really felt like, \u2018I can do this,\u2019\u201d he adds.",
      "Below, Thiele, 28, discusses his breakout summer, that surprising kiss between Anton and Paul Baker (or \u201cPanton,\u201d as fans have dubbed them) and previews what viewers can expect from his own show, \u201cOff Color,\u201d a semi-autobiographical comedy about family.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "'Overcompensating' premiered in May. Weeks later, 'Adults' dropped. How would you describe the past few months?",
      "It is surreal. It is the most insane \u2014 it\u2019s a dream of all dreams. Every time I feel like I\u2019m looking for synonyms in my head for the word whirlwind. It\u2019s just been a whirlwind of joy. It was so amazing to make both shows. I feel like both of the shows that I\u2019m in I got very lucky with the cast and the crew. \u201cAdults\u201d I didn\u2019t know anyone when I started, but they\u2019ve become my best friends, and \u201cOvercompensating,\u201d I knew Benny really well, and he was already my best friend. So it\u2019s just working with friends, which I think you always hear about, but it rarely happens.",
      "'Overcompensating' has been celebrated for embracing millennial culture, whereas 'Adults' has been billed as for Gen Z. Which generation do you identify with?",
      "Well, I\u2019m a cusper. I\u2019m an honest, true cusper. I remember watching \u201cGirls\u201d and being like, \u201cThis is me.\u201d And then now I\u2019m watching TikToks of these 19 year olds, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, my God, that\u2019s totally me.\u201d So I feel like I can kind of straddle both worlds.",
      "How would you sum up the difference between the generations' styles of humor?",
      "I think \u201cOvercompensating\u201d is in the world of \u201cWet Hot American Summer,\u201d these movies that we loved growing up, which just feel fun and camp. It\u2019s so relatable. I dropped out of college after two weeks ... but even still, I was like, \u201cI know a Hailee. I know a Grace.\u201d I knew every character. I feel like the humor is really based in relatability.",
      "And with \u201cAdults,\u201d what I think they do so brilliantly is they take from the Gen Z sensibility of ... it\u2019s just joke after joke. I feel like now with TikTok, we\u2019re so used to this fast paced, joke-after-joke lifestyle. I remember watching a TikTok the other day and it was a minute long. The joke didn\u2019t come until the end and I was like, \u201cThis is so boring.\u201d I\u2019m so used to, like, 10 seconds in there\u2019ll be a joke, 20 seconds in, another.",
      "On your TikTok, you've engaged a lot with fans of the show. What was your approach to putting Anton into your social media?",
      "For me, I think what was fun about the social media aspect is, a lot of who I am as a person is also in Anton. So it was really fun to even just post something that Owen would post and people would be like, \u201cThis is so Anton.\u201d I was like, is that a compliment? Are you roasting me, or are you being super nice?",
      "People have really taken to the Anton and Paul Baker plot line, which I think is so beautiful. It\u2019s so cheesy to say this but it really makes me feel like, \u201cOh, people love, love. Love wins.\u201d",
      "Also, it\u2019s so fun to tease because I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the next season. On my own TikTok, I\u2019m like, \u201cWell, what if this happened?\u201d Then I see the reaction and I\u2019m like, \u201cOK, that can\u2019t happen because everyone hated that TikTok.\u201d I feel like the creators, too, are learning from the way that we have our own special communication with the people watching it. And it feels like we\u2019re just all in a friend group. They\u2019re like, \u201cWait, Issa (Amita Rao) needs a girlfriend in Season 2!\u201d And (creators) Ben (Kronengold) and Rebecca (Shaw) are so brilliant, I feel like they will hear that and take the people watching opinions, because it matters.",
      "Does your phone look like Anton's?",
      "So this is what happened. I'm just gonna tell you it straight. (Laughs). So Episode 1, the pilot, when I auditioned, Anton was struggling with dating as he is in the season, but he was a little more emotionally reserved and a little more cutting. Then as we built this character together, they kind of infused a little bit of my people-pleasing aspects into Anton. So then it became a mix of what they had brilliantly written before, and also a little bit of Owen as well \u2014 I just used my name in the third person ... I cannot believe I just did it.",
      "But yeah, they infuse Anton with me. For instance, the phone episode is very me to the point where I was like, we might as well just use my real phone. We didn\u2019t, thank God. But yes, if you look at my phone, it\u2019s like, \u201cCar Accident No. 4,\u201d like, \u201cGray Socks Guy From Bar.\u201d",
      "Right now I have probably 2,000 unread text messages. But I would like to say that my mother is worse than me and meets people on the street and puts me in group chats with random people. So that's why I have so many unread texts, because my mom will go to a 7-Eleven, meet someone and put me in a group chat with this person and all of his family.",
      "\"Adults\" opens with Issa's boyfriend, the Canadian, sexually fluid Paul Baker (Jack Innanen), moving into the house. He and Anton strike up a close friendship. In the season's finale, Paul Baker learns his visa's expiring, so Issa proposes. After she gets cold feet, their other housemates Samir (Malik Elassal) and Billie (Lucy Freyer) also offer to marry him.",
      "The final scene reveals that Paul Baker and Anton got married. At their roommates' urging, they share a kiss that turns more than platonic. But before anyone can react, the power goes out.",
      "I want to talk about the ending. At the civil wedding ceremony, did Anton volunteer to marry Paul Baker, or did Paul Baker ask Anton to marry him at that moment?",
      "I don't know why, I just got a full chill down my spine. I felt like Anton in this moment.",
      "I probably think, based on who Anton is \u2014 a little more emotionally reserved, emotionally stunted and scared of love \u2014\u00a0I don't think he volunteered. But I think he was so beyond happy when he was asked. That's what I would say.",
      "What has your experience been diving into this fandom?",
      "We'll do anything to make people watch the show. We love it so much that we're like, we will literally read fan fiction if you just turn on the TV. It's been amazing because it feels like everyone watching it and everyone interacting with us online are loving these characters and the stories as much as we did when we were making it. It feels like we\u2019re a little community of people... a group of people that I would get along with.",
      "I love reading all of people\u2019s theories about Paul Baker and Anton, or Samir and Billie, or what Issa is going to do. I\u2019ve never been on a television show that has that. I feel so lucky to be a part of it because I\u2019ve been on the other end for so many shows like that, where I was secretly on my finsta (\u201cfake Instagram,\u201d or a secondary social media account), writing comments about what would happen in the next season of whatever show I\u2019m talking about.",
      "So you were a fan of ship culture?",
      "I love ship culture. (Laughs). I love it. \u201cNew Girl\u201d was a big one for me. Nick and Jess, I was shipping. There\u2019s been so many. I remember re-watching \u201cFriends\u201d during COVID. And I was like, \u201cOh my God. I love Rachel and Ross.\u201d I love a sitcom ship, I really do.",
      "After that kiss, after they deal with the power going out, what happens next?",
      "Here's my theory, and I've never really said this, and maybe I'll get absolutely killed for saying it, but I think they're all going to make it through.",
      "I think Issa and Anton have such a beautiful friendship, and Amita and I actually have mimicked that in real life. We actually are the best of friends. She's gonna be a bridesmaid in my wedding, like, that's the kind of friend she's become to me. So I do feel like, if that happened in real life with Amita and I, we would make it through. I probably wouldn't do it, but we would make it through. So I think everything's gonna be OK, but I do think, of course, there will be some hiccups.",
      "We know Paul Baker has expressed that he thinks Anton's 'the coolest person in the world.' How does Anton view Paul Baker?",
      "I think Anton has finally found someone who he connects to on a level that he's been searching for. But it is just so scary that that person is your best friend's boyfriend.",
      "So I think either this will change him for the better. Maybe he will be more vocal about his feelings, or this will set him back 20 more years. He will never say anything again. Let's hope for the first.",
      "While releasing \u201cOvercompensating\u201d and \u201cAdults,\u201d Thiele has also been working on his own show, \u201cOff Color,\u201d about his relationship with his parents, who adopted him. The show includes executive producer Ilana Glazer.",
      "Per The Hollywood Reporter, the logline reads, \u201cHe\u2019s gay and Black, they\u2019re all Jewish, his mom should be on \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 and his cousin\u2019s a former party girl turned Rabbi-in-training. The comedy is about a son who doesn\u2019t want to grow up, a mother who has no intention of letting him, and a dad who\u2019s probably faking a nap in the other room so he doesn\u2019t have to engage.\u201d",
      "How is the development of 'Off Color' going?",
      "We are chugging along. Our little team, all these people that I\u2019ve looked up to for so long; Kent Alterman and Sarah Babineau were the heads of Comedy Central who greenlit my favorite shows ever, \u201cBroad City\u201d included. And then Ilana, who is a comedy legend and one of my deepest and biggest role models. So it kind of feels crazy to just even work with them.",
      "So we're chugging along, and hopefully something will happen soon.",
      "Thinking of the premise of 'Off Color,' how do you approach putting yourself into a role? Is it natural for you?",
      "Yeah, it is natural \u2014 because I\u2019m such a narcissist. No, no, but it is natural. What\u2019s so funny about writing about my family is that my family is so beautifully insane. I\u2019ll write something and Ilana will read it and be like, \u201cOh, this could not happen.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, no, it just happened two minutes ago, which is why I\u2019m texting you. ... My mother really did this in the grocery store.\u201d",
      "That's why it's so fun, because it feels like family therapy. It feels like I'm journaling about the craziest things that my parents could do. But somehow it's all real."

      "He was \"disturbed\" and \"troubled\" by the images, most of which he saw in news clips, a senior White House official told NBC News.",
      "\"We can save a lot of people,\" Trump said Monday during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland. \"I mean, some of those kids are \u2014 that's real starvation stuff. I see it, and you can't fake it. So we're going to be even more involved.\"",
      "White House officials said Trump had previously approved $60 million for aid to Gaza but that it had gotten little public notice and that the promise of more food \u2014 and a better system to ensure that it gets to civilians \u2014 points to ongoing need.",
      "\"He has continued to see photos of starving children and wants to continue to help,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told NBC News. In 2017, pictures of victims of chemical weapons attacks prompted Trump to launch Tomahawk missiles over Syria.",
      "Trump said Monday that the United States would work with international partners, including Britain and other European nations, to fund and set up food delivery centers in Gaza \u2014 aligning himself with countries that have been far more critical of Israel. A person familiar with Trump's thinking said that, in addition to reacting to images, he got \"an earful\" from Starmer and European Union leaders about the situation in Gaza.",
      "And while it remains to be seen whether there will be any substantive shift in American policy toward Israel, Trump's focus on food aid comes when much of the world, including a rising share of the American public, disapproves of Israel.",
      "In a rare public rebuke, Trump said Monday that he does not agree with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assessment that no one is starving in Gaza.",
      "\"Based on television, I would say not particularly,\" Trump said. \"Because those children look very hungry.\u201d",
      "In doing so, he echoed the sentiments of some in his MAGA political base who have become more vocally critical of Israel over the course of a war that will reach its second anniversary in October. MAGA support for helping Palestinians grew more pronounced on social media over the weekend, adding heft from the political right to long-standing left-wing calls for aid.",
      "\"I can unequivocally say that what happened to innocent people in Israel on Oct 7th was horrific,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a close Trump ally, wrote Sunday on X. \"Just as I can unequivocally say that what has been happening to innocent people and children in Gaza is horrific. This war and humanitarian crisis must end!\"",
      "Theo Von, a popular podcaster who backed Trump's presidential campaign in 2024, pleaded with Trump and leaders of both parties to \"get aid into GAZA NOW?!\"",
      "\"Children are starving to death!!\" he wrote Sunday on X. \"We are America. This isn't about politics. This is about humanity.\"",
      "The proliferation of images of emaciated children prompted recent international outrage, said Basim El-Arra, executive director of the Muslim civil rights and advocacy group CAIR Action, leading the public to flood elected officials with phone calls and for influencers to weigh in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re hearing from their constituents everywhere. We\u2019re talking about Republicans, Democrats, folks on the right, folks on the left. People are saying \u2018enough is enough.\u2019 Big influencers on all sides are coming out and calling out our elected officials for not stopping this. People don\u2019t want to be complicit in this genocide,\u201d El-Arra said.",
      "\u201cSome people thought that he\u2019s going to stop this thing like he promised during the campaign. And then it was one promise after the other. But the reality on the ground is that the genocide continues, and they\u2019re giving cover and sending more money and weapons to Israel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still believe he is the only one that can actually stop this. One phone call to Netanyahu saying: \u2018Enough is enough. That\u2019s it. Stop it now. Cease fire. Let in aid.\u2019\u201d",
      "Extensive reports of famine and starvation have been emerging for months, including a prominent piece by The New York Times in late May, which included an image of a 21-pound 6-year-old.",

      "Vice President JD Vance called on Israel and Arab states in the Gulf to ensure food is getting to Gaza as he talked to reporters in Canton, Ohio, on Monday.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure they get food,\u201d Vance, who emphasized that he blames Hamas for the crisis, said in response to a question from NBC News during a visit to a steel factory.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve also got to make sure that Hamas gets the hell out of Gaza and lets the food come into that terrible, terrible situation \u2014 because I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve all seen these images, you\u2019ve got some really, really heartbreaking cases. You\u2019ve got little kids who are clearly starving to death. Israel\u2019s got to do more to let that aid in, and we\u2019ve also got to wage war on Hamas so that those folks stop preventing food from coming into this territory.\u201d",

They say, \u2018Well, you\u2019ve got to hold Hamas up to the same standard,\u2019\u201d Vance said. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest. Hamas is a terrorist organization. If we ever count on Hamas to get food into Gaza, you\u2019re just going to have more starving kids.\u201d",
      "The fine points of Trump's plan have not yet been laid out publicly, but administration officials said Monday that he is committed to solving the starvation problem.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump wants to alleviate suffering for the people of Gaza because he has a humanitarian heart,\" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said. \"He announced a new aid plan today to help Gazans obtain crucial access to food \u2014 details are forthcoming.\u201d"

      "The ruling was announced by a judge in Bogota, the country\u2019s capital, following a nearly six-month trial in which prosecutors presented evidence that Uribe attempted to influence witnesses who accused the law and order leader of having links to a paramilitary group founded by ranchers in the 1990s.",
      "In a lengthy ruling that lasted more than ten hours, Judge Sandra Heredia said there was enough evidence to determine that Uribe conspired with a lawyer, to coax three former members of paramilitary groups who were in prison into changing testimony they had provided to Ivan Cepeda, a left-wing senator who had launched a probe into Uribe\u2019s alleged ties to a paramilitary group.",
      "The case dates back to 2012, when Uribe filed a libel suit against Cepeda, with the Supreme Court. But in a surprise twist the high court dismissed charges against Cepeda and launched an investigation against Uribe in 2018.",
      "Uribe faces up to 12 years in prison for the crimes he has been charged with. A sentencing will be delivered in a separate hearing. The former president is expected to appeal the ruling in a high court."

      "His comments come as Israel is facing mounting international pressure over a growing hunger crisis in Gaza, where at least 133 people have died by starvation, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. On Sunday, Israel announced a pause in fighting in parts of Gaza to facilitate aid delivery.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said that Israel was \u201cmoving toward full control\u201d of Gaza. Ceasefire discussions have stalled in recent days, and the White House\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff last week brought home the U.S. negotiating team, which had been participating in talks in Qatar.",
      "Asked whether a takeover of Gaza would mean hostages would not come home alive, Graham said, \u201cI hope not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there are people maybe in the Hamas organization that would accept safe passage if they release the hostages,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIf I were Israel, I\u2019d make that offer to Hamas fighters: \u2018You can leave safely. We want our hostages back.\u2019\u201d",
      "Graham continues advocating for special counsel to investigate Obama claims",
      "Graham on Sunday advocated for a special counsel to investigate Republicans\u2019 claims that President Barack Obama tried to influence an intelligence assessment about Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "These claims came to the fore last week when Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard alleged during a press briefing that the former president participated in a \u201ctreasonous conspiracy\u201d to harm Trump\u2019s campaign.",
      "Obama spokesperson Patrick Rodenbush has said that the \u201cbizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction.\u201d NBC News has also reported that former CIA officer Susan Miller, who helped lead the team that produced a report on Russia\u2019s actions during the 2016 election, defended the report and said the White House was \u201clying\u201d about it.",
      "Graham said Sunday that \u201cthe best way to handle this is if there is evidence of a crime being committed, or suspected evidence of a crime being committed, create a special counsel to look at it.\u201d",
      "A special counsel had previously been appointed during the first Trump administration to examine the origins of the Russia probe, and in 2023, then-special counsel John Durham argued that certain FBI personnel \u201cdisplayed a serious lack of analytical rigor toward the information they received.\u201d",
      "A 2020 Senate report backed up the assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, with the then-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, a Republican, saying: \u201cThe Committee found no reason to dispute the Intelligence Community\u2019s conclusions.\u201d",
      "In recent days, critics have accused Republicans of trying to turn the spotlight on Obama to distract from mounting criticism of the White House\u2019s handling of files related to Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Asked whether he was trying to rewrite history to distract from the Epstein news, Graham said: \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m not calling for prosecution against President Obama for treason, but I am calling for an investigation.\u201d"

      "Thousands of aid trucks loaded with lifesaving food, water and medical supplies are lined up outside Gaza, and hundreds more inside the border. A handful of miles away, a third of Gaza\u2019s population is on the brink of starvation, with a surging number dying of malnutrition. Why is it so hard to get aid into the enclave?",
      "The Israeli military, which manages the entry of all aid into the besieged enclave, says it has allowed in an average of 70 trucks a day since May, but that the United Nations and other aid agencies have failed to distribute it.",
      "This number is already far fewer than the hundreds of trucks necessary to feed the population, aid agencies say, and crossing the border into Gaza is just one hurdle in a broken distribution chain largely controlled by Israel since it began allowing a limited flow of aid into the strip in May following a nearly three-month total blockade. The current process is plagued by complex bureaucracy, deadly shootings at aid distribution sites and civil disorder exacerbated by Israel\u2019s relentless bombing campaign.",

      "Publishing their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team hypothesized that it was killed and eaten or consumed through scavenging by a medium sized caiman, a crocodile-like reptile.",
      "\u201cThis is a fascinating story of the interaction of two very iconic animals in the past,\u201d Andr\u00e9s Link, the study\u2019s lead author, told NBC News in an email Wednesday. \u201cWe actually found not only the first record of a terror bird in northern south America, but the tooth marks of a large caiman that has probably fed on it,\u201d he added.",
      "Terror bird fossils, which are rare, have mostly been identified in the southern part of the continent.",
      "While tooth marks are \u201cnot uncommon\u201d in the fossil record, it\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d to find evidence that indicates an apex predator being hunted or scavenged by another, said Link, an associate professor of  biological sciences at the Los Andes University in Colombia.",
      "Writing in \u201cBiology Letters,\u201d the team said the teeth marks showed no signs of healing, suggesting that the attack was fatal.",
      "Based on the finding, they added that terror birds might have faced higher risk of being killed and eaten than previously expected.",
      "To identify the attacker, Link and his team scanned the fossil and analyzed the size, shape and spacing of the tooth marks. After comparing those marks with teeth of crocodyliforms from the region, they concluded that the trace maker was likely a juvenile caiman about 15 feet long.",
      "It remains \u201cvery difficult\u201d to know if the caiman ate the terror bird after killing it or whether it scavenged the carcass, Link said. If the bird was alive, it was likely attacked while drinking at a river, researchers wrote, and conversely, if it was dead, the caiman found and fed on its body near water.",
      "\u201cThis story will not be told completely as we have no further evidence to choose between these two hypotheses.\u201d Link said.",
      "The discovery challenges the assumption of \u201ca linear relation between predators feeding on herbivores feeding in plants,\u201d he added. \u201cThe food web is really much more complex.\u201d",

      "At least 60% of liver cancers could be preventable, according to an analysis published Monday in The Lancet.",
      "Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the world, with around 870,000 cases in 2022. That\u2019s projected to increase to 1.52 million cases in 2050, the new report found, if no changes are made.",
      "The leading cause of liver cancer is viral infections, including the hepatitis B and C viruses. Hepatitis B infections \u2014 which are preventable with a vaccine \u2014 accounted for 39% of liver cancers in 2022. That\u2019s expected to fall slightly, to 36.9%, by 2025. Hepatitis C accounted for 29.1% of liver cancers in 2022 and is also projected to fall, to 25.9%, by 2050.",
      "The proportions of alcohol- and obesity-related liver cancers, however, are projected to rise in the next 25 years. Alcohol accounted for 18.8% of liver cancers in 2022, and that is expected to increase to 21.1% in 2050. The share of liver cancers caused by obesity-related disease is projected to increase from 8% to 10.8% by 2050 due to increasing rates of obesity, diabetes and high cholesterol and other metabolic risk factors.",
      "Dr. Hashem El-Serag, one of the report\u2019s co-authors and chair of the department of medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said the public usually thinks of alcohol as the biggest risk factor for liver cancer.",
      "\u201cI think for most people, if you say cirrhosis, they immediately think of a relative, of someone who was a heavy drinker,\u201d El-Serag said. \u201cI think the vast majority do not make the tie between MASLD, or fatty liver, and cirrhosis and liver cancer.\u201d",
      "MASLD, or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, affects about 25% of adults in the U.S. It\u2019s caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. About 5% of U.S. adults have a more severe form, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to scarring, or cirrhosis, of the liver, significantly increasing the risk of cancer.",
      "Excess alcohol consumption can also lead to cirrhosis.",
      "Liver cancer is still relatively rare in the United States, representing 2.1% of all new cancer diagnoses in 2025. The report estimated that by 2040, U.S. rates of MASLD could more than double, affecting more than 55% of adults.",
      "Detecting liver cancer risk factors",
      "Earlier detection and effective treatment plans for MASLD can reduce the risk of obesity-related liver cancer, El-Serag said. The most common treatment is weight loss. GLP-1 weight loss drugs, which include Ozempic and Wegovy, are promising, he said. (A clinical trial published in April found that Wegovy treated MASH in about two-thirds of patients.)",
      "However, people aren\u2019t screened for MASLD like they are for viral hepatitis, El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Arun Jesudian, a hepatologist and the director of liver quality and inpatient liver services at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, said patients are tested for MASLD and/or MASH if they have elevated liver enzymes in their blood.",
      "Raising awareness about MASLD among both patients and doctors can lead to more effective testing and diagnosis, Jesudian said.",
      "\u201cI think then we need to make sure that providers who are interacting with these patients are looking at the liver disease component of metabolic syndrome,\u201d he said, referring to patients with a cluster of conditions including high blood sugar, high blood pressure and excess weight. \u201cSo checking liver enzymes, that they know how to assess for fibrosis, even based on these blood test scores.\u201d",
      "MASLD and MASH can often be asymptomatic, making self-detection more challenging.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s haphazard. Some people get tested. Others get suspected. Third, who knows?\u201d El-Serag said.",
      "Dr. Neehar Parikh, a hepatologist at the University of Michigan who specializes in liver cancer, said he is seeing more patients with MASLD as a driving factor for liver cancer.",
      "Patients with MASLD can develop liver cancer without developing cirrhosis, making it even more challenging to detect those cases, Parikh said. Up to 40% of those with liver cancers linked to MASLD don\u2019t develop cirrhosis, according to the report.",
      "Figuring out who those patients are is the \u201cmillion-dollar question,\u201d he said. \u201cThose patients that develop MASLD that develop liver cancer, you know, how do you screen that population? We don\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d",
      "Still, Parikh said these types of cases are rare.",
      "Ultimately, Jesudian said, \u201ctreating these liver diseases early is the best way to prevent liver cancer, because liver cancer almost always occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease.\u201d"

Picked 20th overall in the 2023 draft, Nimmala is the first first-generation Indian American to be selected in the first round.",
      "Nimmala, who grew up outside Tampa, Florida, said his father introduced him to cricket at a young age but also taught him baseball. He fell in love with the sport and played competitively all the way through high school until the Blue Jays selected him at just 17 years old.",

      "\u201cTo be able to go there and not only see that baseball is a part of India, as well, but just also trying to make it bigger, I think that makes me super proud,\u201d Nimmala said. \u201cKnowing that I have a possibility of doing that and just seeing how much baseball is played in India already, I thought was very cool.\u201d",
      "Asked how big baseball can be in India, a country with 1.46 billion people, Marinak said MLB has high goals.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a billion fans that are watching cricket, it creates a real opportunity to grow the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can get baseball to the scale of cricket, it would be a huge penetration into that market. It would look a lot like what you see in Japan [and the] United States. It can be done.\u201d",
      "Nimmala says the goal remains to make the major leagues, though that could take multiple years because of his age and experience. His 17 home runs last year led all players ages 18 or younger, and after some early-season struggles, he turned up his production in the second half.",
      "From June 27 on, Nimmala hit .265/.331/.564 with 13 homers over his final 53 games.",
      "Known as a solid fielder, he has elite arm strength, according to MLB.com.",

      "The men were held for four months in the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, a Salvadoran megaprison known for its harsh conditions and reported abuse. The allegations included beatings that left bruises and cuts, psychological abuse and the denial of necessities such as food or bathroom access.",
      "The Trump administration sent about 250 Venezuelan men to CECOT in March and has accused them of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Many of the men and some of their families and attorneys have denied the claim. The men were released and flown to Venezuela on July 18 as part of a prisoner swap with the United States.",
      "Andry Hernandez Romero, a 32-year-old gay asylum-seeker from Venezuela, told NBC News that one day during his imprisonment he was taken to solitary confinement, where prison staff \u201cmade me kneel, perform oral sex on one person, while the others groped me and touched my private parts\u201d and \u201cstroked me with their batons.\u201d",
      "He said he could not identify the guards because their faces were covered and the room did not have a lightbulb, with only a small amount of light coming in through a hole in the ceiling.",
      "Hernandez said the incident left him devastated.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to eat. I didn\u2019t want to do absolutely anything,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThe only thing I did was stay laying down, look at the toilet, remember my family, asking myself a million questions.\u201d",
      "Another detainee who spoke to NBC News, Jerce Reyes, said Hernandez told him after they were released that he was sexually abused by CECOT staff. Hernandez also said on Venezuelan state media that he was sexually abused while in CECOT.",
      "\u201cHe told us that when we arrived in Venezuela, that he suffered abuse at the hands of guards there in El Salvador,\u201d said Reyes, referring to Hernandez\u2019s account of sexual abuse.",
      "Hernandez said he was unaware of any formal system at CECOT through which he could report the alleged abuse and that if detainees tried to complain to superiors at the prison, they would often be subjected to beatings by guards.",
      "The Salvadoran government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hernandez\u2019s sexual assault allegations and claims from other Venezuelan men that they were physically and psychologically abused in the prison. The government has previously said it observes safety and order standards, and the director of CECOT told CNN that \u201cthe whole operation is based on strict respect for human rights.\u201d In a statement, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security referred NBC News to the Salvadoran government for comment because the Venezuelan men were \u201cnot U.S. citizens or under U.S. jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "When asked whether the U.S. government would continue to send people to CECOT, Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, \u201cwhether it is CECOT, Alligator Alcatraz, Guantanamo Bay or another detention facility, these dangerous criminals will not be allowed to terrorize U.S. citizens.\u201d",
      "The statement said that President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u201care using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens off our streets and out of our country. Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u2018You will not be leaving here\u2019",
      "Hernandez and others said they were repeatedly beaten by prison officials.",
      "\u201cOur daily bread there as Venezuelans were beatings, threats. For whatever circumstance,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIf you answer an official, they hit you. ... If you talk, they hit you.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery time they went to hit a large group outside, they would put us in the required position so we couldn\u2019t see. And to hear the moans, to hear how they were hitting the people was also very heavy.\u201d",
      "Another detainee, Andry Blanco Bonilla, 40, said he and the other Venezuelans faced verbal, psychological and physical abuse from the day they entered CECOT.",
      "\u201cThere were so many moments of anguish and terror,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cI feared for my life.\u201d",
      "Blanco Bonilla said that when they first arrived at CECOT, the men were shackled so tightly at the ankles that walking \u201cwould give us cuts and bruises.\u201d He said the guards denied them food and access to bathrooms or showers as punishment.",
      "Blanco Bonilla, who had gone to the U.S. to seek asylum, said he would never forget the words of a prison official who told the detainees, \u201cWelcome to CECOT. Welcome to hell.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou will not be leaving here. Your days are over,\u201d the official said, according to Blanco Bonilla.",
      "The detainees would suffer beatings as the guards saw fit, he said.",
      "\u201cThey tried to avoid hitting our faces. They kicked us in the back or ribs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they made us get on our knees, they would step on our toes with their boots. They hit us with batons, they hit us on the head.\u201d",
      "After a beating, Blanco Bonilla said he would be brought by guards to a prison doctor, who would say to him, \u201cYou hit yourself. How did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "When he tried to tell the doctor that he was beaten by prison staff, a guard would hit him with a baton in the back, Blanco Bonilla said. The doctor would then ask him again, \u201cHow did you hit yourself?\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized that if I didn\u2019t tell them what they wanted, they would keep hitting me,\u201d he said, adding that the doctor would then make a false report about the incident.",
      "\u2018We are only migrants\u2019",
      "Reyes, 36, said one of hardest moments for him was when a prison official \u201cencouraged us to commit suicide\u201d and told him \u201cthis is how your whole nightmare ends.\u201d",
      "\u201cI did think about committing suicide at some point. But I thought about my two daughters, I thought about my family,\u201d he said about his two children, ages 3 and 6.",
      "Reyes said there were days when \u201cwe woke up and all said to ourselves, \u2018We aren\u2019t getting out of here.\u2019\u201d He said he witnessed and experienced physical aggression from CECOT guards.",
      "Reyes said he was thankful that he and other men were able to share copies of the Bible inside and motivate each other.",
      "The detainees who spoke to NBC News said they had no contact with the outside world or access to U.S. officials during the four months they were held in CECOT.",
      "Reyes did recall seeing Noem walk by when she toured CECOT in March, shortly after he and the others were sent there. She went past several cells that Salvadoran officials assured her held hardened criminals and gang members.",
      "Reyes says he wasn\u2019t told Noem was coming but remembers that day as the only day the detainees had gotten something cold to drink.",
      "He said he and others pressed their faces to the bars and saw her. \u201cWe began screaming, \u2018Freedom, freedom, freedom. We are not criminals. We are only migrants,\u2019\u201d Reyes said.",
      "The men were sent to CECOT after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act in March, declaring the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua an invading force. Immigration officials have since used that act to deport hundreds of people without immigration hearings, alleging that they were gang members.",
      "The men who spoke to NBC News, as well as the families of former detainees and their attorneys, have strongly denied any ties to gangs and said they were unfairly targeted because of tattoos that may be popular in Venezuela and are unrelated to Tren de Aragua. They have also said some migrants were denied due process and a chance to defend themselves from the accusations against them. Experts have said tattoos are not closely connected with affiliation to Tren de Aragua. An official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement previously said the administration did not solely rely on tattoos to identify the men sent to CECOT as gang members.",
      "A New York Times investigation, which relied on interviews with prosecutors and law enforcement officials as well as court documents and media reports in multiple countries, found that most of the men sent to CECOT did not have criminal records in the United States or in the region. It found at least 32 of the more than 200 men faced serious criminal accusations or convictions in the United States or abroad. Very few of them appeared to have any documented evidence connecting them to Tren de Aragua.",
      "The men said their strong faith in God, love for their families and a belief that one day they would get justice helped them keep going during their most desperate moments.",
      "\u201cReuniting again with my parents and children was a moment of such happiness,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "While the men resume life back in Venezuela, the question of whether they would ever return to the U.S. remains. During a status hearing Thursday tied to the government\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act, the Department of Justice said it would bring any of the men back for immigration or habeas proceedings if a \u201clawful order\u201d were issued.",
      "\u201cVenezuela has made assurances they\u2019ll allow us to do that,\u201d DOJ attorney Tiberius Davis told the court.",
      "Now that they are back home with their families, the men have said they are demanding justice from Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.",
      "On Thursday, former detainee Neiyerver Adri\u00e1n Leon Rengel filed a complaint, reviewed by NBC News, against the Department of Homeland Security under the Federal Tort Claims Act, claiming he was removed from the United States unlawfully and without due process. The complaint was filed on behalf Rengel by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and the Democracy Defenders Fund, which describes itself as a nonpartisan group that defends democratic institutions and opposes autocrats.",
      "LULAC told NBC News that it also planned to file a lawsuit and expected more lawsuits to come after that.",
      "Rengel alleged that he suffered physical, verbal and psychological abuse in CECOT and that the U.S. government could have and should have secured his release, according to the complaint.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the complaint.",
      "\u201cWe were mistreated, our rights were violated, crimes against humanity were committed,\u201d Blanco Bonilla said.",
      "Hernandez said he and others are still working through the psychological effects of their time in CECOT. \u201cAll 252 [of the men] are doing poorly, mentally.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven though we are free, even though we are now with our families, happy and content,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is still a big mental block, a block that particularly I have not been able to find a way to deal with.\u201d",
      "But despite their ongoing struggles, Hernandez said the shared experience has created a lasting sense of community among the men.",
      "\u201cWe entered [CECOT] as 252 strangers, 252 Venezuelans, but 252 brothers came out,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe all supported each other; we were all there in the constant fight.\u201d",

      "Tadej Poga\u010dar blasted his way to a fourth Tour de France victory on Sunday, besting rival Jonas Vingegaard by 4:24 across the famed Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es finish line.",
      "Billed as a clash between two titans, this year\u2019s race was filled with ghosts of Poga\u010dar\u2019s past, including the Hautacam, Mont Ventoux and the Col de la Loze climbs, where he had lost significant time in previous Tours to Vingegaard.",
      "This year, Poga\u010dar, of UAE Team Emirates XRG, conquered them all.",
      "\u201cJust speechless to win the Tour de France. This one feels especially amazing,\u201d he said. \u201cJust super proud that I can wear this yellow jersey.\u201d",
      "Vingegaard, of Denmark, suffered significant time losses early in the race beginning with his botched performance during the Stage 5 time trial. He crossed the finish 1:20 behind Poga\u010dar, who continued to build a steady time gap that eventually became too large for Vingegaard to overcome.",
      "Despite launching attack after attack and maintaining an upbeat attitude during interviews, Vingegaard, of Visma\u2013Lease a Bike, proved to be a mere mortal compared to Poga\u010dar\u2019s superhuman prowess.",
      "\u201cBattling against Jonas was a tough experience, but I must say to him, respect and big, big congratulations to him for his fight and incredible race,\u201d Poga\u010dar said.",
      "As of Sunday, two-time Tour winner Vingegaard has finished runner-up to Poga\u010dar three times. He will next take on the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, Spain\u2019s grand tour, in August.",
      "His teammate, Belgian rider Wout van Aert, won Sunday\u2019s rainy stage, which featured three climbs around Montmartre instead of the traditional ceremonial ride into Paris. Van Aert stunned onlookers in the last kilometer around the hill, known for its artistic history and the Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur Basilica, as he dropped Poga\u010dar in a final attack on the steepest section.",
      "\u201cWe came to this tour with ambition to also win the yellow jersey, but the strongest rider in the race and biggest rider on the road won,\u201d said van Aert. \u201cI\u2019m proud of how we raced as a team, how we kept trying every day.\u201d",
      "German climber Florian Lipowitz, of Red Bull\u2013BORA\u2013hansgrohe, finished third in the general classification, coming in 11:09 behind Poga\u010dar and taking home the white jersey for best young rider. His podium finish is all the more impressive considering this was his Tour debut. He was meant to be riding in a supportive role for teammate and Tour veteran Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d from Slovenia.",
      "But in the end, Lipowitz, who is 11 years younger than 35-year-old Rogli\u010d, emerged as the stronger rider. And Rogli\u010d, who has crashed out of several grand tours in recent years, appeared happy to just finish the race.",
      "Indeed, this year\u2019s Tour was filled with unforgettable performances by the next generation of emerging talent.",
      "Few people could have predicted the rise of Irish climber Ben Healy, who wore the yellow jersey for two days early in the race after launching strong attacks based purely on instinct. His team, EF Education-EasyPost, came into the race without its team leader, Richard Carapaz, but Healy quickly stepped into the role. He took the Stage 6 win and was awarded with the Tour\u2019s \u201cSuper Combative\u201d prize for what his team described as \u201cexploits\u201d on the road.",
      "\u201cIt is one thing to achieve what you set out to achieve; it is another to do it with a smile,\u201d team sports director Charly Wegelius said in a statement.",
      "Italian sprinter Jonathan Milan, of Lidl\u2013Trek, dominated in the green jersey for much of his Tour debut. The contest for points classification appeared to open in Stage 3 when the reigning champion, Jasper Philipsen, of Alpecin\u2013Deceuninck, was thrown over his handlebars during an intermediate sprint. The Belgian fastman was forced to abandon with a fractured collarbone and at least one broken rib.",
      "Milan and teammate Quinn Simmons, from Durango, Colorado, soon began a relentless campaign to best the remaining sprinters and succeeded. Simmons, donning his iconic handlebar mustache and American flag road champion\u2019s jersey, was seen at the front of the peloton nearly every day for three weeks. He proved to be the perfect lead-out man for Milan, who wouldn\u2019t let rain or crashes slow him down.",
      "In the end, Milan edged out Poga\u010dar in the final points classification and Simmons proposed to his girlfriend \u2014 she said yes! \u2014 after crossing the finish line."

    "story": [
      "Before one of its planes crashed just after takeoff last month, killing at least 260 people, Air India had been a symbol of the country\u2019s global rise.",
      "Only two years earlier, chief executive Campbell Wilson had inaugurated a brand-new Airbus A350, Air India\u2019s first, calling it \u201ca declaration of Indian aviation\u2019s resurgence on the world stage.\u201d",
      "The aircraft\u2019s delivery made headlines across the country, where the public cheered Air India\u2019s transformation from a neglected state-owned flagship carrier into a modern airline that its new owners, the Tata Group, hoped would become the world\u2019s biggest.",
      "Under the Indian conglomerate, which founded the airline in 1932  and bought it back in 2022 after it spent decades under government operation, Air India was making big moves, announcing a record order in 2023 of 470 aircraft valued at more than $70 billion.",
      "A year later, the airline said it had begun a $400 million retrofit of its legacy fleet, accelerating the upgrade by leasing jets from other airlines, including Delta.",
      "That momentum came to a grinding halt last month when a London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed seconds after takeoff in the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad, killing all but one of the 242 people aboard plus 19 others on the ground in one of India\u2019s worst aviation disasters.",
      "Air India has since been under immense pressure to answer for the crash, but bereaved families were left with more questions after investigators released a preliminary report this month that said the plane\u2019s fuel switches had been wrongly cut off, leading to speculation that one of the pilots might have done it accidentally or even intentionally.",
      "Indian investigators and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is involved in the crash investigation as the aircraft is U.S.-made, said such conclusions were irresponsible.",
      "\u201cInvestigations of this magnitude take time,\u201d NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy said, while India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau urged the public and the media to \u201crefrain from spreading premature narratives.\u201d",
      "But Indian commentators were already irate.",
      "\u201cWhy do this rumor mill mongering about possible problems with the pilot?\u201d Arnab Goswami, a firebrand anchor, said on his conservative Republic Media Network. \u201cSo that across the world the impression goes that Indian pilots cannot fly?\u201d",
      "Capt. C.S. Randhawa, a former pilot for Air India and the Indian air force, said the suggestion that one of the pilots may have crashed the plane deliberately has \u201cdemoralized the pilots in the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll pilots are up in arms, and it\u2019s not a good thing. The pilots have to fly with that mental attitude,\u201d Randhawa, who is currently the president of the Federation of Indian Pilots, told NBC News.",
      "The head of the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that the crash did not appear to have been caused by a mechanical issue with the Boeing fuel control unit. The final report is due next year.",
      "On top of the lack of clarity, some British families hoping to bury their loved ones said they had received the remains of the wrong people, according to the Daily Mail, which cited a lawyer representing them. The Indian foreign ministry said Wednesday that all remains were being handled with \u201cutmost professionalism\u201d and that it was working closely with the British side to address concerns.",
      "Air India was also warned last week by India\u2019s aviation regulator that it could face enforcement action over more than two dozen safety violations from this year and last year, Reuters reported, citing government notices. They include pilots not being given mandatory rest and poor compliance with simulator training requirements.",
      "The airline, which voluntarily disclosed the problems last month, said Friday that it would respond to the regulator and that it \u201cremains fully committed to ensuring the safety of its passengers and staff.\u201d",
      "Air India was already under enormous pressure to clean up its reputation after falling into disrepair during its nearly 70 years of government ownership. Its reform nevertheless aligned perfectly with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s nationalist narrative of turning India into a global superpower.",
      "\u201cGiven its legacy, the brand remains synonymous with India,\u201d said Shelley Vishwajeet, a New Delhi-based aviation journalist and  author of \u201cThe IndiGo Story,\u201d a book about the Indian airline. He added that the cultural transformation within Air India \u201chas been a challenge\u201d for its new owners.",
      "Things moved quickly after the takeover by the Tata Group, which consolidated several airlines it controlled, including Vistara and Air Asia India, into two entities: the full-cost carrier Air India and its budget arm, Air India Express.",
      "Vistara, which was partly owned by Singapore Airlines, was particularly beloved by Indians, known for its modern planes and best-in-class customer experience. When it merged with Air India, travelers and crew hoped that Air India would be the true Vistara successor.",
      "But Air India has struggled to deliver change as fast as some had hoped.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re struggling with maintenance issues, disrepair issues, and all these things are taking time,\u201d Randhawa said."

      "Israeli gunfire and airstrikes killed more than 50 Palestinians in Gaza on Saturday, including some who were waiting overnight for aid, according to local health officials, continuing a pattern that has drawn international criticism as the country\u2019s \u201cdrip-feeding of aid\u201d into the enclave continues to claim lives.",
      "Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, said at least 61 people were killed in Gaza so far this weekend, including those waiting in line for aid at the Zikim crossing with Israel, \u201ca number of starving children\u201d and a group recovered in southern Khan Younis.",
      "In the Zikim area, at least a dozen were killed as they waited for aid trucks, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The latest killings near an aid distribution site come amid what many have described as Israel\u2019s \u201cdrip-feeding of aid\u201d into Gaza, a tactic that has contributed to more than 120 deaths from malnutrition and left a third of the population on the brink of starvation.",
      "The criticism is disputed by the Israeli military, which says it has allowed in an average of 70 trucks a day since May. But aid agencies say hundreds more trucks a day are necessary to feed Gaza\u2019s starving population.",
      "Late Saturday, Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry announced that a \u201chumanitarian pause\u201d will be observed Sunday morning in Gaza to allow aid to reach civilian centers.",
      "Five deaths due to malnutrition were recorded in Gaza in the last 24 hours, the Palestinian Health Ministry in the territory said on Saturday. At least 127 people, including 85 children, have died as a result of hunger in the enclave since Oct. 7, 2023, according to the ministry.",

      "U.N. spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric told reporters this week that there was \u201ca lack of willingness\u201d from Israel to allow them to distribute aid.",
      "Israel has accused Hamas of stealing U.S.-funded aid, citing that as a main rationale, along with the U.S., for proposing a new armed, private aid operation.

      "Party leader Sohei Kamiya, who since 2022 had held Sanseito\u2019s only seat in the upper house of Japan\u2019s parliament, will now be joined by 14 others in the 248-seat chamber. It\u2019s a far cry from the party\u2019s origin as a fringe anti-vaccination group on YouTube during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Though Japan has long had a complex relationship with foreigners and its cultural identity, experts say Sanseito\u2019s rise is another indication of the global shift to the right embodied and partly fueled by Trump, with populist figures gaining ground in Europe, Britain, Latin America and elsewhere.",
      "Kamiya \u201cfancies himself a mini-Trump\u201d and \u201cis one of those who Trump has put wind in his sails,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "Speaking at a rally on Saturday at Tokyo\u2019s Shiba Park, Kamiya said his calls for greater restrictions on foreign workers and investment were driven not by xenophobia but by \u201cthe workings of globalization.\u201d He criticized mainstream parties\u2019 support for boosting immigration in an effort to address the labor shortage facing Japan\u2019s aging and shrinking population.",
      "\u201cJapan is still the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have 120 million people. Why do we have to rely on foreign capital?\u201d Kamiya told an enthusiastic crowd.",
      "The election results were disastrous for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is facing calls to resign now that his conservative Liberal Democratic Party \u2014 which has ruled almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II \u2014 has lost its majority in both houses of parliament.",
      "The Japanese leader had also been under pressure to reach a trade deal with the Trump administration, which said Tuesday that the two sides had agreed to a 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese goods.",
      "On Wednesday, Ishiba denied reports that he planned to step down by the end of August.",
      "The message from his party\u2019s string of election losses is that \u201cpeople are unhappy,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel that the status quo is biased against their interests and it advantages the elderly over the young, and the young feel sort of resentful that they\u2019re having to carry the heavy burden of the growing aging population on their back,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamiya, 47, an energetic speaker with social media savvy, is also a strong contrast to leaders such as Ishiba and the Constitutional Democrats\u2019 Yoshihiko Noda, both 68, who \u201clook like yesterday\u2019s men\u201d and the faces of the establishment, Kingston said.",
      "With voters concerned about stagnating wages, surging prices and bleak employment prospects, \u201cthe change-makers got a lot of protest votes from people who feel disenfranchised,\u201d he said.",
      "Sanseito\u2019s platform resonated with voters such as Yuta Kato.",
      "\u201cThe number of [foreign immigrants] who don\u2019t obey rules is increasing. People don\u2019t voice it, but I think they feel that,\u201d the 38-year-old hairdresser told Reuters in Tokyo. \u201cAlso, the burden on citizens including taxes is getting bigger and bigger, so life is getting more difficult.\u201d",
      "The biggest reason Sanseito did well in the election, he said, \u201cis that they are speaking on behalf of us.\u201d",
      "Kamiya\u2019s party was not the only upstart to benefit from voter discontent, with the center-right Democratic Party for the People increasing its number of seats in the upper house from five to 16.",
      "Sanseito, whose name means \u201cParticipate in Politics,\u201d originated in 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic, attracting conservatives with YouTube videos promoting conspiracy theories about vaccines and pushing back against mask mandates. Its YouTube channel now has almost 480,000 subscribers.",
      "The party has also warned about a \u201csilent invasion\u201d of foreigners in Japan, where the number of foreign residents rose more than 10% last year to a record of almost 3.8 million, according to the Immigration Services Agency. It remains far lower as a proportion of the population than in the U.S. or Europe, however.",
      "Critics say such rhetoric has fueled hate speech and growing hostility toward foreigners in Japan, citing a survey last month by Japanese broadcaster NHK and others in which almost two-thirds of respondents agreed that foreigners received \u201cpreferential treatment.\u201d",
      "At the Sanseito rally on Saturday, protesters held up signs that said \u201cNo Hate\u201d and \u201cRacists Go Home.\u201d",
      "Kamiya denies that his party is hostile to foreigners in Japan.",
      "\u201cWe have no intention of discriminating against foreigners, nor do we have any intention of inciting division,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re just aiming to firmly rebuild the lives of Japanese people who are currently in trouble.\u201d",
      "Despite its electoral advances, Sanseito doesn\u2019t have enough members in the upper house to make much impact on its own and has only three seats in the more powerful lower house. The challenge, Kingston said, is whether Kamiya can \u201ctake this anger, the malaise, and bring his show nationwide.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An internal U.S. government analysis found no evidence of systematic theft by the Palestinian militant group Hamas of U.S.-funded humanitarian supplies, challenging the main rationale that Israel and the U.S. give for backing a new armed private aid operation.",
      "The analysis, which has not been previously reported, was conducted by a bureau within the U.S. Agency for International Development and completed in late June. It examined 156 incidents of theft or loss of U.S.-funded supplies reported by U.S. aid partner organizations between October 2023 and this May.",
      "It found \u201cno reports alleging Hamas\u201d benefited from U.S.-funded supplies, according to a slide presentation of the findings seen by Reuters.",
      "A State Department spokesperson disputed the findings, saying there is video evidence of Hamas looting aid, but provided no such videos. The spokesperson also accused traditional humanitarian groups of covering up \u201caid corruption.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesperson, Anna Kelly, questioned the existence of the analysis, saying no State Department official had seen it and that it \u201cwas likely produced by a deep state operative\u201d seeking to discredit President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201chumanitarian agenda.\u201d",
      "The findings were shared with the USAID\u2019s inspector general\u2019s office and State Department officials involved in Middle East policy, said two sources familiar with the matter, and come as dire food shortages deepen in the devastated enclave.",
      "Israel says it is committed to allowing in aid but must control it to prevent it from being stolen by Hamas, which it blames for the crisis.",
      "The U.N. World Food Program says nearly a quarter of Gaza\u2019s 2.1 million Palestinians face famine-like conditions, thousands are suffering acute malnutrition, and the World Health Organization and doctors in the enclave report starvation deaths of children and others.",
      "The U.N. also estimates that Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 people seeking food supplies, the majority near the militarized distribution sites of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the new private aid group that uses a for-profit U.S. logistics firm run by a former CIA officer and armed U.S. military veterans.",
      "The study was conducted by the Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA) of USAID, which was the largest funder of assistance to Gaza before the Trump administration froze all U.S. foreign aid in January, terminating thousands of programs. It has also begun dismantling USAID, whose functions have been folded into the State Department.",
      "The analysis found that at least 44 of the 156 incidents where aid supplies were reported stolen or lost were \u201ceither directly or indirectly\u201d due to Israeli military actions, according to the briefing slides.",
      "Israel\u2019s military did not respond to questions about those findings.",
      "The study noted a limitation: because Palestinians who receive aid cannot be vetted, it was possible that U.S.-funded supplies went to administrative officials of Hamas, the Islamist rulers of Gaza.",
      "One source familiar with the study also cautioned that the absence of reports of widespread aid diversion by Hamas \u201cdoes not mean that diversion has not occurred.\u201d",
      "The war in Gaza began after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing 251 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Nearly 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israeli assault began, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israel says Hamas diverts aid",
      "Israel, which controls access to Gaza, has said that Hamas steals food supplies from U.N. and other organizations to use to control the civilian population and boost its finances, including by jacking up the prices of the goods and reselling them to civilians.",
      "Asked about the USAID report, the Israeli military told Reuters that its allegations are based on intelligence reports that Hamas militants seized cargoes by \u201cboth covertly and overtly\u201d embedding themselves on aid trucks.",
      "Those reports also show that Hamas has diverted up to 25% of aid supplies to its fighters or sold them to civilians, the Israeli military said, adding that GHF has ended the militants\u2019 control of aid by distributing it directly to civilians.",
      "Hamas denies the allegations. A Hamas security official said that Israel has killed more than 800 Hamas-affiliated police and security guards trying to protect aid vehicles and convoy routes. Their missions were coordinated with the U.N.",
      "Reuters could not independently verify the claims by Hamas and Israel, which has not made public proof that the militants have systematically stolen aid.",
      "GHF also accuses Hamas of massive aid theft in defending its distribution model. The U.N. and other groups have rejected calls by GHF, Israel and the U.S. to cooperate with the foundation, saying it violates international humanitarian principles of neutrality.",
      "In response to a request for comment, GHF referred Reuters to a July 2 Washington Post article that quoted an unidentified Gazan and anonymous Israeli officials as saying Hamas profited from the sales and taxing of pilfered humanitarian aid.",
      "Aid groups required to report losses",
      "The 156 reports of theft or losses of supplies reviewed by BHA were filed by U.N. agencies and other humanitarian groups working in Gaza as a condition of receiving U.S. aid funds.",
      "The second source familiar with the matter said that after receiving reports of U.S.-funded aid thefts or losses, USAID staff followed up with partner organizations to try to determine if there was Hamas involvement.",
      "Those organizations also would \u201credirect or pause\u201d aid distributions if they learned that Hamas was in the vicinity, the source said.",
      "Aid organizations working in Gaza also are required to vet their personnel, sub-contractors and suppliers for ties to extremist groups before receiving U.S. funds, a condition that the State Department waived in approving $30 million for GHF last month.",
      "The slide presentation noted that USAID partners tended to over-report aid diversion and theft by groups sanctioned or designated by the U.S. as foreign terrorist organizations \u2014 such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad \u2014 because they want to avoid losing U.S. funding.",
      "Of the 156 incidents of loss or theft reported, 63 were attributed to unknown perpetrators, 35 to armed actors, 25 to unarmed people, 11 directly to Israeli military action, 11 to corrupt subcontractors, five to aid group personnel \u201cengaging in corrupt activities,\u201d and six to \u201cothers,\u201d a category that accounted for \u201ccommodities stolen in unknown circumstances,\u201d according to the slide presentation.",
      "The armed actors \u201cincluded gangs and other miscellaneous individuals who may have had weapons,\u201d said a slide. Another slide said \u201ca review of all 156 incidents found no affiliations with\u201d U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations, of which Hamas is one.",
      "\u201cThe majority of incidents could not be definitively attributed to a specific actor,\u201d said another slide. \u201cPartners often largely discovered the commodities had been stolen in transit without identifying the perpetrator.\u201d",
      "It is possible there were classified intelligence reports on Hamas aid thefts, but BHA staff lost access to classified systems in the dismantlement of USAID, said a slide.",
      "However, a source familiar with U.S. intelligence assessments told Reuters that they knew of no U.S. intelligence reports detailing Hamas aid diversions and that Washington was relying on Israeli reports.",
      "The BHA analysis found that the Israeli military \u201cdirectly or indirectly caused\u201d a total of 44 incidents in which U.S.-funded aid was lost or stolen. Those included the 11 attributed to direct Israeli military actions, such as airstrikes or orders to Palestinians to evacuate areas of the war-torn enclave.",
      "Losses indirectly attributed to Israeli military included cases where they compelled aid groups to use delivery routes with high risks of theft or looting, ignoring requests for alternative routes, the analysis said."
