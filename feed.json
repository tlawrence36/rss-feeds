      "Lee Soo Man spent three decades trying to bring K-pop into the global market, often bending but never breaking his vision",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Lee Soo Man resisted the title at first. \u201cKing of K-pop\u201d sounded too brash, too nightclub-esque \u2014 like something you\u2019d see on a neon sign in Itaewon, a nightlife neighborhood in the South Korean capital Seoul once popular with U.S. soldiers and foreign visitors. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Couldn\u2019t it be Father of K-pop?\u2019\u201d the 73-year-old recalled during a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He was discussing the title of Amazon Prime's documentary about his career. The producers insisted the bolder moniker would resonate better with American audiences. After some back-and-forth, Lee relented. \u201cI had to follow their decision.\u201d",
      "The compromise speaks to Lee\u2019s pragmatic approach to breaking South Korean acts into the American mainstream \u2014 a three-decade quest that often required him to bend but never break his vision. Now, as the founder of SM Entertainment and widely credited as the architect of K-pop\u2019s global expansion, Lee will be inducted into the Asian Hall of Fame on Saturday alongside basketball legend Yao Ming, Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, and rock icon Yoshiki, among others.",
      "Lee remains a prominent but controversial figure in K-pop history. His label pioneered the industry\u2019s intensive training system, recruiting performers as young as elementary school age and putting them through years of rigorous preparation. Some of his artists have challenged their contracts as unfair, sparking broader debates about industry practices.",
      "The recognition arrives as Lee reemerges into the spotlight after a contentious, high-profile departure from the agency he founded in 1995 \u2014 a management battle that included a public feud with his nephew-in-law and a bidding war over his shares. He\u2019s been keeping busy since, debuting a new band, A2O MAY, in both China and the U.S. He's also investing in a boutique Chinese firm\u2019s high-tech production technologies.",
      "Born in South Korea, Lee studied computer engineering in the U.S. for his master's degree. That technical background would later inform his approach to everything from visualization and cutting-edge production technologies \u2014 he said he\u2019s been rewatching \"The Matrix\u201d to revisit filming techniques \u2014 to pioneering elaborate \u201cworldviews\u201d and virtual avatars for his K-pop bands.",
      "For Lee, the Hall of Fame honor \u201cconfirms that K-pop has become a genre that the mainstream is now paying attention to\u201d \u2014 an acceptance that came after costly lessons and years of trial and error.",
      "Lee invested about $5 million in BoA\u2019s 2009 American debut with \u201cEat You Up,\u201d one of the first songs by a South Korean artist to be primarily written and produced by Western producers \u2014 a bold early attempt to bring K-pop into the U.S. mainstream. But with few widely recognized Asian artists in American pop culture at the time, the market wasn\u2019t ready. After nearly two years, BoA \u2014 already a megastar in Korea and Japan \u2014 decided to return home. The experience, Lee has said, left him with lasting regrets.",

      "That setback taught Lee that K-pop needed to source global talent while maintaining creative control to adapt songs for the worldwide market. His quest for the perfect tracks took him worldwide.",

But I wanted to play it safe, so I found the Finnish address, went to meet the songwriter directly, wrote up a contract, and brought it back.\u201d",
      "At the time, top Western songwriters prioritized Japan, the world\u2019s second-largest music market. \u201cEuropean songwriters were willing to sell to Asia,\u201d Lee explained. \u201cThat\u2019s how we eventually built a system where music from Europe, Asia, and America could come together.\u201d",
      "That fusion became K-pop\u2019s signature. Lee also helped to pioneer another innovation: elaborate fictional universes, or \u201cworldviews,\u201d for groups like EXO and aespa \u2014 a storytelling approach that would later be adopted across the industry, including by groups like BTS.",
      "The concept emerged during his time in the U.S., where he witnessed MTV transform music into a visual medium. \u201cBut we only have three or four minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we express dramatic, cinematic elements in such a short time?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Florence Welch explores her desire for greatness and the constraints she faces as a female artist in Florence + the Machine's sixth album, \"Everybody Scream.\"",
      "During his acceptance speech for best actor at this year\u2019s Screen Actors Guild Awards, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet made known his desire to be remembered as \u201cone of the greats.\u201d A few years earlier, Chalamet starred in Greta Gerwig\u2019s adaptation of \u201cLittle Women,\u201d in which his character demonstratively asks his future wife, \u201cWhat women are allowed into the club of geniuses, anyway?\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody Scream,\u201d Florence + the Machine\u2019s sixth album, is a response to that familiar, gendered notion. Across its 12 tracks, Florence Welch contends with both her desire for greatness and the constraints she understands to have been put on her as a female artist.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if Welch had Chalamet\u2019s viral speech in mind when writing, \u201cOne of the Greats,\u201d the album\u2019s lead single. But what is apparent in her brooding feminist treatise are grievances about sexism and male entitlement. \u201cIt must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,\u201d she belts over gothic synths and strings. But it's a bit funny, too: \"Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m a fan, you\u2019re my second favorite frontman.\u201d",
      "Welch collaborated with Mark Bowen of IDLES for much of the record, as well as Mitski and Aaron Dessner of The National. Sometimes the collaborations create a haunting sound, but most of \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is packed with the band's signature orchestral pop, an ornate arrangement of strings, synths, guitars, pianos and percussion.",
      "Perhaps to a fault, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d isn\u2019t sonically dissimilar from what fans of Florence + the Machine have come to expect. But in a lyrical shift, Welch meditates heavily on mysticism and witchcraft throughout, something she turned to after suffering a nearly fatal ectopic pregnancy in 2023. The 39-year-old later revealed that she performed with a burst fallopian tube during her last tour and had to undergo emergency surgery.",
      "\u201cI sit in salt water/Call in a vision of my daughter/Light a candle/Place my grief upon the altar,\u201d her voice vibrates over haunting background vocals and an eerie electric guitar on \u201cYou Can Have It All.\u201d",
      "The record is reminiscent of Halsey\u2019s 2021 concept album, \u201cIf I Can\u2019t Have Love, I Want Power,\u201d where femininity and motherhood are juxtaposed with influence, respect and violence.",
      "There\u2019s a similar rawness to Welch\u2019s poetry, as she grapples with mortality and ambition. But, like life, it\u2019s also accompanied by the mundane. \u201cDownloading \u2018Revelations of Divine Love\u2019 on my phone/Trying to read but getting distracted/Trying to live but feeling so damaged,\u201d she sings on \u201cPerfume and Milk,\u201d one of the more austere songs on the album.",
      "As a concept, \u201cEverybody Scream\u201d is stellar. There\u2019s a sonic and thematic unity to the album and its Halloween release makes perfect sense.",

Kennedy Jr. and his deputies against a chemical that is a mainstay of dental care.",
      "The FDA said that the products are no longer recommended for children younger than 3 and those who are older but don't face serious risks of tooth decay. Previously, the products have been prescribed for children as young as six months.",

      "The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for educators, wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown has been a source of anxiety for school leaders wondering how long grant money will last and who can help them interpret federal laws. For Education Secretary Linda McMahon, it offers a preview of what she hopes to make permanent.",
      "Much of the department\u2019s work has gone completely cold. No new grants are being awarded, and civil rights investigations have been halted. Money is still flowing for key programs, but in many respects, schools and states are on their own.",
      "That\u2019s the vision President Donald Trump has promoted since his presidential campaign \u2014 a world where states fully have the reins of education policy with little or no influence from the federal government.",
      "Even before the shutdown, mass layoffs had left the agency with 2,400 employees, down from 4,100 when Trump took office. Remaining workers have mostly been furloughed during the budget impasse, leaving some 330 who are responsible for carrying out duties that are deemed essential.",
      "In a recent social media post, McMahon said the shutdown proves her department is unnecessary. \u201cTwo weeks in, millions of American students are still going to school, teachers are getting paid, and schools are operating as normal,\u201d McMahon wrote.",
      "She offered a more direct assessment days later, after the agency hit its 46th year: \u201cWe don\u2019t need a birthday cake,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe need an eviction notice.\u201d",
      "Some say the shutdown's impact has been more significant. They warn that funding for preschool centers and school meals is running out, and students with disabilities might not be getting the help they need.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the impact so far.",
      "Most of the billions of dollars the Education Department steers to schools each year went out the door in October, leaving schools funded until July.",
      "Other programs that aren\u2019t funded in advance face more uncertainty. That includes federally funded Head Start preschool centers and school nutrition programs funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said Julia Martin, director of policy and government affairs at the Bruman Group, an education law firm.",
      "Districts are required to cover the cost of school meals and then seek reimbursement from the Department of Agriculture, but the agency said it only has two months of reimbursements left amid the shutdown.",
      "\u201cDistricts are really worried that they\u2019re going to have to dig deep into their pockets to fund meals,\u201d Martin said.",
      "The last remnants of federal COVID-19 aid are still being released by the Education Department, but reimbursements have slowed with fewer staff reviewing the requests, Martin said.",
      "America\u2019s public schools are primarily funded by states and cities, but federal funding plays an important role. The billions sent already to schools include grants to help low-income students, those with disabilities and other populations.",
      "Grant competitions to award smaller amounts of money have largely frozen. Schools and states that already received grants can keep spending them down, but all new grantmaking has ceased, the department said. At the college level, federal Pell grants for low-income students are still flowing, and the FAFSA financial aid form is still being processed.",
      "Ordinarily, states and schools rely on the department to answer questions on a wide range of topics \u2014 from special education laws to statewide academic assessments to laws requiring public schools to provide certain services to students at private schools.",

      "That work, known as technical assistance, has halted during the shutdown, and the Trump administration has moved to eliminate it almost entirely. A new round of layoffs this month targeted most workers in the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education.",
      "Also gutted was the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which ensures that students with disabilities get the services they\u2019re entitled to under federal law. It maintains \u201cvery regular\u201d communication with states to field questions on coordinating aid to families and eliminating waitlists, said Katy Neas, CEO of The Arc of the United States, a disability rights group.",
      "The new layoffs have been halted by a federal judge. But as the shutdown drags on, more states are likely to break federal laws unknowingly because they can\u2019t get help from the government, said Neas, who led the special education office under former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cPeople of good intention and good faith are going to have honest questions that they're not going to be able to get an answer for,\u201d Neas said.",
      "Some states have turned instead to law firms for advice, but there are not always clear answers. In August, the department rescinded 2015 guidance explaining schools\u2019 legal obligations to students who are learning English. But with no new guidance replacing it before the government shutdown, schools have questions about their responsibilities, said Martin, of the Bruman law firm.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, a lot of districts are just going to continue to follow the old guidance because it\u2019s the best thing they have,\u201d Martin said.",
      "McMahon has acknowledged that only Congress can fully eliminate the Education Department, despite Trump's campaign pledge to shut it down. As a workaround, officials have been developing plans to transfer core functions to other agencies.",

      "The new deaths were reported in Hawaii and Oregon, the CDC said. Previous deaths were reported in Illinois, Michigan, Texas and Utah. One person who became ill was pregnant and it resulted in the death of a fetus.",
      "The outbreak has been traced to precooked pasta produced by Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California. In September, the company recalled nearly 245,000 pounds (111,130 kilograms) of pasta, including cases of linguine, fettuccine, penne and other products sold to large producers of heat-and-eat meals and pasta salads.",

      "Bill Swick, who has a rare degenerative brain disease, has lost access to virtual speech therapy due to the federal government shutdown",
      "MINOOKA, Ill. -- Bill Swick has a rare degenerative brain disease that inhibits his mobility and speech. Instead of the hassle of traveling an hour to a clinic in downtown Chicago to visit a speech therapist, he has benefited from virtual appointments from the comfort of his home.",
      "But Swick, 53, hasn\u2019t had access to those appointments for the last month.",
      "The federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week, halted funding for the Medicare telehealth program that pays his provider for her services. So, Swick and his wife are practicing old strategies rather than learning new skills to manage his growing difficulties with processing language, connecting words and pacing himself while speaking.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating because we want to continue with his journey, with his progress,\u201d 45-year-old Martha Swick, a caregiver for her husband since his diagnosis three years ago, said during an interview at their home in Minooka, Illinois. \u201cI try to have all his therapy and everything organized for him, to make his day easier and smoother, and then everything has a hitch, and we have to stop and wait.\u201d",
      "Their experience has become common in recent weeks among the millions of patients with Medicare fee-for-service plans who count on pandemic-era telehealth waivers to attend medical appointments from home.",
      "With Congress unable to agree on a deal to fund the government, the waivers have lapsed, even with support from Republicans and Democrats. As a result, medical providers are deciding whether they can continue offering telehealth services without the guarantee of reimbursement or whether they need to halt virtual visits altogether.",
      "That\u2019s left a patient population of mostly older adults with fewer options to seek specialists or get help when they can\u2019t physically travel far from home.",
      "Swick, whose corticobasal degeneration causes symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease, can\u2019t feed or dress himself anymore and struggles with balance and walking. Add on the logistical nightmare of driving to the city in traffic, and in-person speech therapy appointments aren\u2019t a worthwhile ordeal for him and his wife.",
      "But missing even a few appointments can impede progress for patients with dementia and other degenerative conditions who depend on continuity of care, experts said.",
      "It \u201cfeels like you\u2019re taking a step back,\u201d Swick said in the interview.",
      "Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Medicare only paid for virtual medical appointments under narrow circumstances, including in designated rural areas and when patients logged in from eligible sites, like hospitals and clinics.",
      "That changed in 2020, when Trump\u2019s first administration dramatically expanded telehealth coverage in response to the public health emergency. Medicare started reimbursing a wide range of telehealth visits, stripping the geographic requirement, and allowing patients to take calls from their homes.",
      "Congress has routinely extended the telehealth flexibilities and was poised to do so again before their Sept. 30 expiration. But when budget negotiations stalled and the government shut down Oct. 1, the vote never happened, leaving the program temporarily unfunded.",
      "With more than 4 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries using telehealth in the first half of 2025, according to Brown University\u2019s School of Public Health, the pause has had a major impact on an already vulnerable population.",
      "Swick\u2019s speech therapy services are provided by the Chicago-area business Memory and Aphasia Care. Owner Becky Khayum said many of her clients are in different cities and states and sought her therapists out because they specialize in frontal temporal dementias.",
      "\u201cNow suddenly without telehealth services, they do not continue to have the support to participate in those activities that are so important to them,\u201d Khayum said. \u201cThe risk is we could see social withdrawal; we could see depression and anxiety increased.\u201d",

He said that in the current Medicare telehealth pause, one of his patients wasn\u2019t having regular check-ins and ended up in the emergency room.",
      "Susan Collins, 73, in Murrieta, California, said Medicare-reimbursed telehealth appointments were a \u201ctremendous relief\u201d to her when she was a full-time caregiver for her late husband, Leo. Before he died last year from progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disorder, she struggled to lift him from his wheelchair in and out of the car for his in-person doctor visits 60 miles from their home.",
      "\u201cHe was much safer at home,\u201d Collins said, noting that telehealth was a useful resource when her husband needed a medication or symptom consultation but not a complete physical exam.",
      "The latest guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not ban medical providers from providing telehealth services during the lapse \u2013 but it stops short of promising they\u2019ll be reimbursed if they do.",
      "In response, providers are deciding whether they can absorb the risk of continuing care without assurance that they\u2019ll be paid for it when the government reopens.",
      "Khayum in Illinois said she had to stop providing telehealth services to Medicare patients because her small business couldn\u2019t handle the volatility of potentially losing out on payments. Ghoddusi, the family medicine provider, said his Oregon practice is honoring telehealth appointments made before Oct. 1 but not scheduling additional ones for Medicare patients until the funding is restored.",

Dr. Helen Hughes, medical director of the Office of Telemedicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine, said the hospital initially continued the care, but paused scheduling more Medicare telehealth visits as of Oct. 16 as the shutdown continued.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Tuesday called for tripling the government spending on projects for expanding artificial intelligence infrastructure and technology in a budget speech.",
      "Lee also called for lawmakers to approve a planned 8.2% increase in defense spending next year, which he said would help modernize the military\u2019s weapons systems and reduce its reliance on the United States, as the allies\u2019 military chiefs met in Seoul for annual security talks.",
      "Most conservative opposition lawmakers boycotted Lee\u2019s speech amid an ongoing rift over a criminal investigation into former President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Lee\u2019s speech came after South Korea last week hosted the leaders of major Pacific Rim nations for this year\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, which his government used to showcase its ambitions for AI and advance an effort at a trade deal with the U.S.",
      "In his speech at the National Assembly, Lee highlighted his APEC diplomacy and a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which he said eased uncertainties facing South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy by securing lower tariffs on automobiles and computer chips, two of the country\u2019s key exports.",
      "He said the country was still facing a critical moment for \u201cnational survival\u201d amid rapid changes in the global trade order and a \u201chuge, transformative wave of AI.\u201d",
      "Lee said the proposed budget of 728 trillion won ($506 billion), which would represent an all-time high for government spending, would be the country\u2019s \u201cfirst budget to open the AI era.\u201d",
      "He called on the liberal-led legislature to approve 10.1 trillion won ($6.9 billion) in AI-related spending \u2014 more than triple this year\u2019s level \u2014 to advance the country\u2019s AI computing and manufacturing capabilities, with a particular focus on industries such as semiconductors, automobiles, shipbuilding and robotics.",
      "\u201cJust as President Park Chung-hee paved the highway for industrialization and President Kim Dae-jung built the highway for the information age, we must now construct the highway for the AI era to open a future of progress and growth,\u201d Lee said, referring to major development drives under Park\u2019s dictatorship in the 1960s and \u201970s and Kim\u2019s presidency from 1998 to 2003, which focused on expanding South Korea\u2019s internet infrastructure.",
      "Lee said South Korean companies would have little difficulty securing the chips for their AI projects, citing a deal for Nvidia, whose GPUs power much of the global AI industry, to supply 260,000 graphics processing units for AI infrastructure projects with major South Korean businesses and the government. The deal was announced following a meeting during APEC between Lee and Jensen Huang, the Silicon Valley company\u2019s chief executive.",
      "It isn\u2019t immediately clear when Nvidia \u2014 which agreed to deliver 50,000 GPUs each to the government, chipmakers Samsung and SK, and automaker Hyundai, and another 60,000 to internet company Naver \u2014 will deliver those chips. Huang told reporters in South Korea that AI data centers and power networks must first be established before the company can begin shipping the GPUs.",

      "North Korea says its longtime ceremonial head of state Kim Yong Nam has died at age 97",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Kim Yong Nam, a longtime North Korean ceremonial head of state best known for his trademark propaganda-filled speeches with a deep, booming voice in support of the ruling Kim dynasty, has died, state media reported Tuesday.",
      "The Korean Central News Agency said that Kim Yong Nam, former president of the Presidium of North Korea\u2019s rubber-stamp Supreme People\u2019s Assembly from 1998 to 2019, died Monday of multiple organ failure at the age of 97.",
      "KCNA said that leader Kim Jong Un visited the bier of Kim Yong Nam early Tuesday to express deep condolences over his death. Kim Yong Nam is not related to Kim Jong Un, the third generation of his family to rule North Korea since its foundation in 1948.",
      "\u201cComrade Kim Yong Nam faithfully upheld the party's ideology and leadership and displayed his distinctive competence and experience on the international stage, making notable contributions in the history of our country's politics and diplomacy,\u201d KCNA said.",
      "KCNA said North Korea will hold a state funeral for him on Thursday. It released a list of 100 funeral committee members with Kim Jong Un\u2019s name at the top.",
      "Born in 1928 into \u201ca patriotic family\u201d resisting then Japanese colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula, Kim Yong Nam held a string of top posts since he joined the ruling Workers\u2019 Party in the mid-1950s, according to KCNA. His tenure as head of North Korea's parliament made him the country's nominal head of state and allowed him to appear frequently in state media greeting visiting foreign dignitaries.",
      "But the true power was held by the Kim family, which maintains absolute control of North Korea's 26 million people. Kim Jong Un, grandson of state founder Kim Il Sung, took power upon his father Kim Jong Il\u2019s death in 2011 in the country\u2019s second hereditary power transfer.",
      "In February 2018, Kim Yong Nam traveled to South Korea with Kim Jong Un\u2019s influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, to attend the opening ceremony of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics as North Korea sought better ties with South Korea and the U.S. after years of heightened animosities on the Korean Peninsula. At the opening ceremony, Kim Yong Nam and Kim Yo Jong sat within feet of then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, though the two sides made no apparent contact.",
      "That Pyeongchang trip made Kim Yong Nam the highest-level North Korean official to visit South Korea since 2014. North Korea's temporary diplomatic openness peaked when Kim Jong Un met U.S. President Donald Trump three times from 2018-19, before the high-stakes summitry collapsed due to wrangling over U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea. Trump recently expressed his desire to meet Kim Jong Un again during his trip to South Korea last week, but North Korea didn't respond.",
      "South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young, a supporter of greater reconciliation with North Korea, expressed his condolences over Kim Yong Nam\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cHe contributed to opening South-North Korea dialogue by coming to South Korea as head of a North Korean delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in 2018,\u201d Chung said in a statement. \u201cI also recall I had meaningful talks with him about peace on the Korean Peninsula and development of South-North Korea relations\u201d during meetings in 2005 and 2018, both in Pyongyang.",

      "Kim Yong Nam\u2019s career epitomized that of a successful North Korean bureaucrat. He survived major political purges through the 1970s. He was appointed to the powerful Politburo in 1978 and served 15 years as foreign minister, starting in 1983. He was left intact even when Kim Jong Un orchestrated a series of purges and executions, including the spectacular 2013 killing of his powerful uncle, in the early years of his rule in an apparent bid to remove his potential rivals from the old guard.",

      "And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States' withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.",
      "The newest climate-fighting plans \u2014 mandated every five years by the 2015 Paris Agreement \u2014 shaves about three tenths of a degree Celsius (nearly six tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) off a warming future compared with the projections a year ago.",

It is particularly important for those vulnerable communities and ecosystems that are already being impacted,\u2033 said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate U.N. scientific panel that calculates climate impacts. \u201dIt matters in heat waves. It matters in ocean heat waves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long-term when we think about sea level rise. \u2033",
      "Global average temperature increase is mainly caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which happens when fuels like oil, gas and coal are burned. So the plans that countries turn in must detail how, and how fast, they will cut emissions of such gases.",
      "Within the next decade, Earth is likely to blow past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which is the internationally agreed-upon goal made in Paris. If nations do as they promise in their plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.1 to 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit), the report calculates.",

      "Even super fast and deep cuts in emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will still more than likely mean global temperatures go up at least 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) this century with efforts then to bring them back down, the report says.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Saudi oil giant Aramco reported Tuesday a $26.9 billion profit in the third quarter, down slightly from last year as global energy prices remain depressed over concerns of too much oil being on the market.",
      "Aramco's results serve as a bellwether for the wider oil industry, which is still digesting the OPEC+ decision this weekend to halt planned production increases in the first quarter of next year over supply worries. Benchmark Brent crude, at just under $65 a barrel, has been fluttering near a four-year low.",
      "In filing on Riyadh\u2019s Tadawul stock exchange, Aramco, formally known as the Saudi Arabian Oil Co., reported overall revenue of $111 billion in the third quarter, compared with $123 billion in the same period last year. Its profit in the third quarter last year was $27.5 billion.",
      "The figures slightly beat analysts\u2019 projections.",
      "\u201cAramco\u2019s ability to adapt to new market realities has once again been demonstrated by our strong third quarter performance,\" Aramco President and CEO Amin H. Nasser said in a statement. \u201cWe increased production with minimal incremental cost, and reliably supplied the oil, gas and associated products our customers depend on.\u201d",
      "Under IFRS accounting standards, Aramco reported a net profit of $27.9 billion based on an adjusted bookkeeping.",
      "On Sunday, OPEC+ met and decided to increase its production by an additional 137,000 barrels of oil beginning in December. However, it said other adjustments planned in January, February and March of next year would be paused \u201cdue to seasonality.\u201d",

      "Shareholders of Kimberly-Clark, whose brands include Huggies, Kleenex and Cottonelle, will own about 54% of the combined company. Kenvue shareholders will own about 46%.",
      "Kenvue has spent a relatively brief period as an independent company, having been spun off by Johnson & Johnson two years ago. J&J first announced in late 2021 that it was splitting its consumer health division from the pharmaceutical and medical device divisions in a bid to make each more nimble.",
      "Kenvue was thrust into the national spotlight last month when Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. reasserted the unproven link between the pain reliever Tylenol and autism, and suggested people who opposed the theory were motivated by hatred for President Donald Trump.",
      "During a meeting with Trump and the Cabinet, Kennedy reiterated the connection, even while noting there was no medical proof to substantiate the claim.",
      "In July Kenvue, which also makes brands such as Listerine and Band-Aid, announced that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving as it continued with its strategic review. Board member Kirk Perry is serving as interim CEO.",
      "The combined company is expected to generate 2025 annual net revenues of approximately $32 billion. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue said that they identified about $1.9 billion in cost savings that are expected in the first three years after the transaction's closing.",

      "The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It still needs approval from shareholders of both both companies.",
      "Kenvue shareholders will receive $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares for each Kenvue share held at closing. That amounts to $21.01 per share, based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark shares on Friday.",
      "Shares of Kimberly-Clark slipped more than 15% before the market open, while Kenvue's stock jumped more than 20%.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A major question hangs over the Supreme Court's closely watched case on President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariffs: Will the conservative majority hold the Republican president to the same exacting standards it used to limit his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden?",
      "Key legal principles at the heart of conservative challenges to major initiatives in the Biden years are driving the arguments in the fight against Trump\u2019s tariffs, which is set for arguments at the high court on Wednesday.",
      "The businesses and states that sued over the tariffs are even name-checking the three Trump-appointed conservative justices whose votes they hope to attract to stop a centerpiece of Trump\u2019s economic agenda in a key test of presidential power.",
      "Trump imposed two sets of tariffs, determining that sustained trade deficits had brought the United States to \u201cthe precipice of an economic and national-security crisis\u201d and that hundreds of thousands of deaths from imported fentanyl had created a crisis of its own, the administration told the justices.",
      "Until this year, no president had used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs since its enactment in 1977.",
      "The law makes no mention of tariffs, taxes, duties or other similar words, although it does allow the president, after he declares an emergency, to regulate the importation of \"any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.\u201d",
      "That authorization, the administration argued, is enough to support the tariffs, and the absence of any \u201cmagic words\u201d is irrelevant.",
      "During Biden\u2019s presidency, conservative majorities made it harder to fight climate change under existing law and blocked several actions related to the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "The court ended a pause on evictions, prohibited a vaccine mandate for large businesses and rejected Biden's $500 billion student loan forgiveness program.",
      "In each case, the court held that Congress had not clearly authorized an action of economic and political significance, a legal principle known as the major questions doctrine.",
      "The Washington-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had little trouble applying those precedents to the tariffs case.",
      "Referring to the eviction pause and the student debt cases, a seven-judge majority wrote, \u201cIndeed, the economic impact of the tariffs is predicted to be many magnitudes greater than the two programs that the Supreme Court has previously held to implicate major questions.\u201d",
      "The tariff challengers are defending the appellate decision at the Supreme Court by leaning into the opinions from the earlier cases.",
      "\u201cAbsent vigilance under the major questions doctrine, \u2018legislation would risk becoming nothing more than the will of the current President,\u2019\u201d lawyers for a Chicago-area toy company, Learning Resources Inc., wrote, quoting an opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch in the climate change case.",

      "\u201cSuch a limitation would be especially out of place in an emergency statute like IEEPA,\u201d Taranto wrote, explaining that it was intended to give presidents flexibility to cope with crises.",

      "Dozens of centers are missing out on federal grant payments that were due to arrive Nov. 1. Some say they'll close indefinitely, while others are staying afloat with emergency funding from local governments and school districts. The closures mean Head Start students \u2014 who come from low-income households, are homeless or are in foster care \u2014 are missing out on preschool, where they are fed two meals a day and receive therapy vital to their development.",
      "\u201cChildren love school, and the fact that they can\u2019t go is breaking their hearts,\u201d said Sarah Sloan, who oversees small-town Head Start centers in Scioto County, Ohio. Staff told families they planned to close Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s hampering our families\u2019 ability to put food on the table and to know that their children are safe during the day.\u201d",
      "A half-dozen Head Start programs never received grants that were anticipated in October, but there are now 140 programs that have not received their annual infusion of federal funding. All told, the programs have capacity to assist 65,000 preschoolers and expectant parents.",
      "Among the preschools closing as of Monday are 24 Migrant and Seasonal Head Start centers spread across five states. Those centers, created to assist the children of migrant farmworkers, typically operate on 10- to 12-hour days to accommodate the long hours parents work on farms.",
      "Children attending the centers in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama and Oklahoma recently came home with fliers warning of possible closures, along with other parent notifications. Those centers serving more than 1,100 children will now remain closed until the shutdown ends, said East Coast Migrant Head Start Project CEO Javier Gonzalez. About 900 staff members across the centers also have been furloughed.",
      "In the absence of other options for child care, some parents\u2019 only option may be to bring their young child to the fields where they work, Gonzalez said.",
      "Many of the families that qualify for the federal preschool program also depend on food aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or food stamps. That program also was on track to run dry of money due to the shutdown, although a pair of federal judges on Friday ordered the Trump administration to keep the program running with emergency reserve funds.",
      "That means many Head Start families have been worried about food aid, along with the child care they rely on to make ends meet. A day without child care means a day without work for many parents \u2014 and a day without pay.",
      "In Kansas City, Missouri, Jhanee Hunt teaches toddlers at a Head Start site, the Emmanuel Family and Child Development Center, where her 6-month-old son is cared for in another classroom. The center said it can scrape up enough money to stay open for a few weeks, but the money won\u2019t last much beyond November.",
      "At dropoff, she said, parents often are wearing uniforms for fast food restaurants like Wendy\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s. Some work as certified nurse assistants in nursing homes. None have much extra money. The most urgent concern right now is food, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of the parents, they\u2019re, you know, going around trying to find food pantries,\u201d she said. \u201cA parent actually asked me, do I know a food pantry?\u201d",

      "The average price for a gallon of gasoline in the U.S., a key economic and political indicator in the country, stood at $3.03 on Monday. Trump also has criticized both OPEC+ and Saudi Arabia at times over the price per barrel, particularly in his first term.",
      "Meanwhile, both the United States and the United Kingdom implemented new oil sanctions targeting Russia over its war on Ukraine. Those sanctions targets included Rosneft and the Russian oil company Lukoil, whose red-and-white logo hung over the annual oil conference. The UAE has maintained close ties to Russia despite the war, but has served as a key interlocutor between Kyiv and Moscow to negotiate prisoner exchanges.",
      "\u201cThe Russian and Ukraine war is being funded by energy sales,\u201d Burgum said on a stage that had flashed the Lukoil logo before his remarks.",
      "The oil conference comes after the UAE hosted COP28. Those talks ended with a call by nearly 200 countries to move away from planet-warming fossil fuels \u2014 the first time the conference made that crucial pledge. Scientists have called for drastically slashing the world\u2019s emissions by nearly half in the coming years to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) compared with pre-industrial times.",
      "But the UAE as a whole still plans to increase its production capacity of oil to 5 million barrels a day in the coming years as it pursues more clean energy at home.",
      "Qatari Energy Minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi repeated a warning to the European Union that his nation could halt their liquefied natural gas shipments \u2014 something crucial due to Russian LNG being banned \u2014 over its Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. That seeks to have companies pursue net-zero emission goals.",
      "\u201cI think, you know, a small part of this conference, unfortunately, changes with politics depending on when it was President Biden and President Trump and so on,\" al-Kaabi said. \"I think that they're not looking at facts and realities and I think we shouldn't be following politics when we look at the lives of people for the future and how much energy we need in the future.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump says he \u201cwon\u2019t be extorted\u201d by Democrats to reopen the government, making clear that he has no plans to negotiate as the government shutdown will soon enter its sixth week",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he \u201cwon't be extorted\u201d by Democrats to reopen the government, making clear that he has no plans to negotiate as the government shutdown will soon enter its sixth week.",
      "In an interview on CBS's \u201c60 Minutes\" that aired on Sunday, Trump said that Democrats who are demanding an extension in health care subsidies \u201chave lost their way\" and predicted that they will eventually capitulate to Republicans who have said they won't negotiate until they vote to reopen the government.",
      "\u201cI think they have to,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd if they don't vote, it's their problem.\u201d",
      "Trump's comments signal that the shutdown could continue to drag on for some time as federal workers, including air traffic controllers, are set to miss additional paychecks and as there is uncertainty over whether 42 million Americans who received federal food aid will be able to access the assistance. Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times against reopening the government, insisting that they need Trump and Republicans to negotiate with them first on an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Instead of negotiating, the president reiterated his pleas to Republican leaders to change Senate rules and scrap the filibuster. But Senate Republicans have rejected that idea, arguing that the rule requiring 60 votes to overcome any objections in the Senate is vital to the institution and has allowed them to stop Democratic policies when they are in the minority.",
      "\u201cRepublicans have to get tougher,\u201d Trump said in the CBS interview. \u201cIf we end the filibuster, we can do exactly what we want.\u201d",
      "With the two parties at a standstill, the shutdown, now in its 33rd day, appears likely to become the longest in history. The previous record was set in 2019, when Trump demanded that Congress give him money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "Trump\u2019s push on the filibuster could prove a distraction for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Republican senators who have opted instead to stay the course as the consequences of the shutdown have become more acute.",
      "Republicans are hoping that at least some Democrats will eventually give them the votes they need as moderates have been in weekslong talks with rank-and-file Republicans about potential compromises that could guarantee votes on health care in exchange for reopening the government. Republicans need five additional Democrats to pass their bill.",
      "\u201cWe need five with a backbone to say we care more about the lives of the American people than about gaining some political leverage,\u201d Thune said on the Senate floor as the Senate left Washington for the weekend on Thursday.",
      "Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat, said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday that there is a group of people talking about \u201da path to fix the health care debacle\u201d and a commitment from Republicans not to fire more federal workers. But it\u2019s still unclear if those talks could produce a meaningful compromise.",
      "Trump said in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that the Affordable Care Act, often known as Obamacare because it was signed and championed by former President Barack Obama, is \"terrible\" and that if the Democrats vote to reopen the government, \u201cwe will work on fixing the bad health care that we have right now.\u201d",
      "Democrats feel differently, arguing that the marketplaces set up by the ACA are working as record numbers of Americans have signed up for the coverage. But they want to extend subsidies first enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic so that premiums won't go up for millions of people on Jan. 1.",
      "\u201cWe want to sit down with Thune, with (House Speaker Mike) Johnson, with Trump, and negotiate a way to address this horrible health care crisis,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said last week.",
      "As Democrats have pushed Trump and Republicans to negotiate, Trump has showed little interest in doing so. He immediately called for an end to the Senate filibuster after a trip to Asia while the government was shut down.",
      "White House Spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d on Fox News that the president has spoken directly to both Thune and Johnson about the filibuster. But a spokesman for Thune said Friday that his position hasn\u2019t changed, and Johnson said on Sunday that Republicans traditionally have resisted calling for an end to the filibuster because it protects them from \u201cthe worst impulses of the far-left Democrat Party.\u201d",

      "The movie exhibition business is wrapping up one of its slowest Octobers in over 25 years with a sluggish Halloween weekend",
      "The movie exhibition business is closing out one of its slowest Octobers in over 25 years with a sluggish Halloween weekend. Studios avoided opening any major new films with the holiday falling on a Friday. Instead, there were several re-releases including \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d which is celebrating its 40th anniversary, and the Netflix phenomenon \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "But even with a top 10 in which no films earned more than $10 million, there was still a bit of excitement as two studios claimed the No.1 spot Sunday. Universal\u2019s horror sequel \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d was largely expected to top the charts in its third weekend in theaters, and the studio reported that it was going to be in first place with an estimated $8 million. About 30 minutes later, Paramount reported that its romantic drama \u201cRegretting You\u201d had earned an estimated $8.1 million, which would place it in the top spot instead. Box office tracker Comscore went by the numbers and gave the first place title to \u201cRegretting You.\u201d Sunday numbers are based on estimates and projections, however, and sometimes Monday actuals tell a different story.",
      "\u201cRegretting You\u201d is the latest Colleen Hoover adaptation to open in theaters since \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d became a runaway hit in theaters. With a running domestic total of $27.5 million, this newest film is not going to match its predecessor, which made $50 million its first weekend.",
      "In three weekends \u201cBlack Phone 2\u201d has made $61.5 million domestically and $104.7 million globally. Universal also handled the nationwide re-release of Robert Zemeckis\u2019s \u201cBack to the Future\u201d which earned $4.7 million from 2,290 theaters \u2013 enough to snag a fifth-place spot on the North American charts. The 1985 time travel classic now has a domestic total of $221.7 million.",
      "Though there were plenty of HUNTR/X costumes on the streets this weekend, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d didn\u2019t do as well as it did when it played in theaters in August. That weekend, the streaming hit sold between $16 and $20 million in movie tickets. This weekend, it\u2019s estimated to have earned somewhere in the $5 million range from 2,890 screens. Two distribution executives shared numbers on the condition of anonymity because Netflix has a policy of not reporting ticket sales.",
      "Sony Pictures and Crunchyroll\u2019s \u201cChainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc\u201d dropped a steep 67% in its second weekend and is projected to add $6 million from 3,003 locations, bringing its total to $30.8 million.",
      "Focus Features also launched \u201cBugonia\u201d into wide release after several weeks in limited. With an estimated $4.8 million from 2,043 theaters, it marks filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s best wide break to date. The darkly comedic thriller stars Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons and is expected to be an awards season player.",
      "\u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere\u201d landed in sixth place, behind \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d and down 57% in its second weekend. It earned $3.8 million, putting its domestic total at $16.3 million and its global tally at $30.6 million.",
      "\u201cThis was a truly scary weekend,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s head of marketplace trends. \u201cIt was this imperfect storm of Halloween on a Friday and the World Series on Friday and Saturday. But the studios and theaters knew this was on the horizon and they planned for it.\u201d",
      "The weekend may net out to be one of the lowest grossing of the year, closing out an unusually slow October. With the exception of October 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the month\u2019s total ticket sales ($443 million) have not been this low since 1998 ($455.5 million).",
      "The next two weekends may bring some energy back to multiplexes, however, with releases like \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d and \u201cNow You See Me: Now You Don\u2019t,\u201d but the industry will likely have to wait until closer to Thanksgiving for a real blockbuster when \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d and \u201cZootopia 2\u201d enter the mix.",
      "\"This was always going to be a tough weekend. The audience was truly fragmented,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cThere are weekends where the movie theaters are the focus of the attention, and those are coming.\"",

While it might not be traditional NFL content, it's resonating and building on the league's push to attract young women through partnerships with women-centered media outlets.",
      "The league partnered with Betches last December, and finalized a partnership with The Gist, a female-fan focused sports site and newsletter, in August. The NFL has long seen women as key to their efforts to broaden the league's appeal, a push that gained extra momentum after Taylor Swift began her highly-publicized relationship with now-fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs.",
      "\u201cAs we want to connect with this audience, authentic, real storytelling is absolutely key,\u201d said Marissa Solis, the senior vice president of global brand and consumer marketing at the NFL. \u201cSo rather than doing targeted ads that really don\u2019t connect ... you give access to (Betches and The Gist) but they tell the story in their own point of view, being there, front and center. And I think that connection is something paid advertising can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "Both outlets receive access to NFL tentpole events \u2014 the Super Bowl, the draft and the combine, to name a few \u2014 to create articles and content for their platforms, alongside additional league content. Betches, for example, kicked off a tailgate tour series as part of its partnership, and The Gist debuted a free game for predicting each week\u2019s winners.",
      "The partnerships are all in pursuit of growing and engaging the league\u2019s large female fanbase, a demographic that has often been underestimated or overlooked. A September poll by Ipsos found that 41% of American women were NFL fans.",
      "That translates into the potential for big business, leading the NFL to turn to outlets that already have deep connections with women.",
      "\u201cWe center women in everything that we do. It\u2019s not an afterthought, it\u2019s not like you are adding the W to the end of ESPN,\u201d said Jacie deHoop, who co-founded The Gist with Ellen Hyslop and Roslyn McLarty in 2017. \u201cMore data and research on women is showing what an underserved and huge audience and fan base this is.\u201d",
      "In addition to traditional game reports and on-the-field breakdowns, a large part of the strategy around appealing to women \u2014 and to a new generation of NFL fans more broadly \u2014 is human-centric content. Through an approach aptly dubbed \u201chelmets off\u201d by the NFL, the league and their partners are focusing on content about the players themselves, looking to forge stronger connections by using more personal storytelling.",

      "\u201cRelating to someone will have them lean in, versus pushing a marketing narrative that you think perhaps would get someone to tune in on a Sunday,\u201d Windt continued. The NFL \u201cis not looking just for that tune in ... We\u2019re really collaborating on building fandom over time.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat's better than two?\u201d manager Dave Roberts asked at the team's rally at Dodger Stadium on Monday. \u201cThree \u2014 three-peat! Three-peat!\u201d",
      "Roberts said he'd gotten permission from his friend Pat Riley to use the phrase that the Miami Heat president trademarked in 1988.",
      "Soft-spoken and rarely seen team owner Mark Walter vowed to be \u201cback next year\u201d for another championship celebration.",
      "First baseman Freddie Freeman told a sold out crowd, \"Job in 2024, done. Job in 2025, done. Job in 2026 starts now.\u201d",
      "With three titles in the last six years, the Dodgers next will attempt to equal the New York Yankees, who were the last team to win three consecutive championships from 1998-2000.",
      "\u201cI'm already thinking about the third time we're going to do this,\" two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani said.",
      "It certainly seems possible. The team brings back all of its biggest names, alternately striking fear and grudging admiration in the hearts of baseball's other 29 teams. Los Angeles opened as +350 World Series favorites for 2026, according to Bet MGM Sportsbook.",
      "Andrew Friedman, president of baseball operations, has already referred to this time as \u201cthe golden era of Dodgers baseball.\u201d",
      "Throw in five National League pennants in the last nine years and 12 NL West titles in 13 years and, well, the word dynasty is becoming synonymous with the Dodgers.",
      "\u201cI think definitionally it's a dynasty,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cFor me, it's still evolving and growing and we want to add to it and we want to continue it and do everything we can to put it at a level where people after us have a hard time reaching.\u201d",
      "The Dodgers won the title last year mixing and matching their relievers. This season, the starting rotation survived a string of injuries to return in time to pitch the team to its ninth World Series title in franchise history.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really an exceptional, exceptional staff,\u201d Phillies president Dave Dombrowski said after his team lost to the Dodgers in the NL Division Series. \u201cIf you're going to beat them, you're really going to have to do everything right.\u201d",
      "Ohtani was brought along slowly in his return to the mound this season after rehabbing from elbow surgery in December 2023. He produced another NL MVP-worthy season at the plate and with no restrictions on the mound next year could do things few think possible.",

      "The two most prominent are Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez and Game 7 hero Miguel Rojas, whose home run tied the game in the ninth inning against the Toronto Blue Jays.",
      "The Dodgers figure to make a push to bring Hern\u00e1ndez back. He was a regular starter in the postseason where some of his biggest exploits have occurred. Rojas has been valuable off the bench the last three years and his ability to play all three infield positions helped the team withstand injuries to Max Muncy and Tommy Edman. But he's 36 and the Dodgers may want to acquire youth off the bench.",
      "The other four free agents are Michael Conforto and pitchers Andrew Heaney, Michael Kopech and Kirby Yates. None of them made any of the team's postseason rosters.",
      "Conforto hit .199 and never lived up to his $17 million, one-year deal despite spending most of the season as the starting left fielder. Yates, who came in on a $13 million, one-year deal, had a 5.23 ERA in 41 1/3 innings pitched. He had three stints on the injured list and at 38 has hinted he might retire.",
      "Kopech was part of a dominant bullpen that helped carry the Dodgers to their 2024 championship. But he began this season on the injured list and later had knee surgery. He was limited to pitching in 14 games before his season ended in September with another IL stint.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Tuesday called for tripling the government spending on projects for expanding artificial intelligence infrastructure and technology in a budget speech.",
      "Lee also called for lawmakers to approve a planned 8.2% increase in defense spending next year, which he said would help modernize the military\u2019s weapons systems and reduce its reliance on the United States, as the allies\u2019 military chiefs met in Seoul for annual security talks.",
      "Most conservative opposition lawmakers boycotted Lee\u2019s speech amid an ongoing rift over a criminal investigation into former President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Lee\u2019s speech came after South Korea last week hosted the leaders of major Pacific Rim nations for this year\u2019s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, which his government used to showcase its ambitions for AI and advance an effort at a trade deal with the U.S.",
      "In his speech at the National Assembly, Lee highlighted his APEC diplomacy and a bilateral meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which he said eased uncertainties facing South Korea\u2019s trade-dependent economy by securing lower tariffs on automobiles and computer chips, two of the country\u2019s key exports.",
      "He said the country was still facing a critical moment for \u201cnational survival\u201d amid rapid changes in the global trade order and a \u201chuge, transformative wave of AI.\u201d",

      "He called on the liberal-led legislature to approve 10.1 trillion won ($6.9 billion) in AI-related spending \u2014 more than triple this year\u2019s level \u2014 to advance the country\u2019s AI computing and manufacturing capabilities, with a particular focus on industries such as semiconductors, automobiles, shipbuilding and robotics.",
      "\u201cJust as President Park Chung-hee paved the highway for industrialization and President Kim Dae-jung built the highway for the information age, we must now construct the highway for the AI era to open a future of progress and growth,\u201d Lee said, referring to major development drives under Park\u2019s dictatorship in the 1960s and \u201970s and Kim\u2019s presidency from 1998 to 2003, which focused on expanding South Korea\u2019s internet infrastructure.",
      "Lee said South Korean companies would have little difficulty securing the chips for their AI projects, citing a deal for Nvidia, whose GPUs power much of the global AI industry, to supply 260,000 graphics processing units for AI infrastructure projects with major South Korean businesses and the government. The deal was announced following a meeting during APEC between Lee and Jensen Huang, the Silicon Valley company\u2019s chief executive.",
      "It isn\u2019t immediately clear when Nvidia \u2014 which agreed to deliver 50,000 GPUs each to the government, chipmakers Samsung and SK, and automaker Hyundai, and another 60,000 to internet company Naver \u2014 will deliver those chips. Huang told reporters in South Korea that AI data centers and power networks must first be established before the company can begin shipping the GPUs.",

      "During his meeting with Trump, Lee reaffirmed South Korea\u2019s commitment to increase defense spending and called for U.S. support for South Korean efforts to acquire nuclear-powered submarines.",

      "Lee\u2019s speech came as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and South Korean Defense Minister Ahn Gyu-back were meeting in Seoul for the allies\u2019 annual security talks. The meeting is expected to address key alliance issues, including South Korea\u2019s defense spending commitments and the implementation of a plan to transfer wartime operational control to a joint command led by a South Korean general with a U.S. deputy.",

    "story": [
      "Lambert, a critically endangered African penguin, has moved to a special geriatric island at the New England Aquarium in Boston",
      "BOSTON -- When Lambert started losing his vision and slowing down a few steps, it became clear that he needed to be relocated to a place where he could age safely and still be with his friends.",
      "But he couldn't be placed in just any nursing home \u2014 because he is a critically endangered African penguin. Instead, the New England Aquarium in Boston, where the 33-year-old Lambert was born and has lived his entire life, decided in February to open a geriatric island for him and its six other aging penguins.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it sort of started off as a joke. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, well, why don\u2019t we give them an old folks home?\u2019\u201d Eric Fox, associate curator of penguins at the aquarium, said. \u201cBut the more we were looking at their welfare data and understanding what ailments they go through, what physical limitations they have, we started to realize that we were on to something.\u201d",
      "The rocky island near the aquarium entrance is set apart from the rest of the 38-bird colony, ensuring the older penguins don't have to compete for territory with their often aggressive, younger peers. These penguins, with their trademark black and white feathers, stand about 2 feet (0.6 meters) tall and weigh about as much as a large house cat.",
      "The enclosure has some flatter topography and a carpeted path down to the water, which allows Lambert and the other penguins to better navigate up and down the island. The aquarium has built a stand in front of the island, which makes it easier for the penguins to hop out of the water.",
      "As a result, Mia Luzietti, a senior penguin trainer at the aquarium, said she has seen Lambert become more active since moving to the new island \u2014 swimming more with his mate and getting off the island more often.",
      "The concept was inspired by a larger concern that is confronting zoos and aquariums around the world \u2014 what to do when their animals are surviving far longer than their counterparts in the wild. In the case of these African penguins, some are in their 30s and one lived into its 40s. That is twice as long as they would live in the wilds of South Africa and Namibia, due to threats like pollution and lack of food from humans\u2019 overfishing.",
      "\u201cIt's really important that, as we learned how long these animals could live, if given an optimal environment, that we evolved with that,\u201d Luzietti said.",
      "\u201cSo learning on an individual level, how can we best set our animals up for success is really what led to the idea of creating our geriatric island, a place where our oldest penguins have a more comfortable, slower way of life as they live out their days here,\u201d she added.",

      "Caring for the aging penguins goes far beyond a safer enclosure.",
      "The older birds get more checkups than their younger counterparts, and veterinarians offer them treatment for ailments that might be familiar to older humans \u2014 such as supplements and anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis and joint pain, and eye drops for glaucoma. There are also more cameras around the island, so staff can better monitor the birds.",
      "\u201cWe are just keeping a little closer of an eye on some of these older birds,\u201d Luzietti said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we\u2019re picking up on those \u2014 from how someone\u2019s hips are moving, how they\u2019re walking, how they are acting, if someone\u2019s squinting. The smallest change day to day can be hiding a really big secret.\u201d",
      "On a recent day, Luzietti was in the geriatric enclosure tending to Lambert \u2014 who seemed content to stand at the top of the island with his mate Dyer III, preening one another and occasionally letting out a loud call that sounded like a donkey's bray. He previously had his left eye removed due to an infection and has glaucoma in his right eye. He also suffers from chronic inflammation.",
      "Luzietti coaxed him down from his perch, and soon he was sitting on her lap, getting ready for his daily dose of eye drops.",
      "A crowd had formed around the enclosure to watch, including Terri Blessman, a 69-year-old tourist from Canton, Illinois, who was being pushed in a wheelchair by her friend Lou Ann Delost. Hearing about Lambert's age and the care he gets, Blessman said she could relate.",
      "\u201cThat's wonderful,\u201d Blessman said. \u201cAll of us older people need extra care as we get older.\u201d",

That makes the moon look up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than the faintest moon of the year, according to NASA.",
      "November's supermoon is the second of three supermoons this year and also the closest: The moon will come within just under 222,000 miles (357,000 kilometers) of Earth.",
      "Tides may be slightly higher during a supermoon because the moon is closer to Earth, said astronomer Lawrence Wasserman with Lowell Observatory. But the difference isn't very noticeable.",

      "The recent escape of several research monkeys after the truck carrying them overturned on a Mississippi interstate is the latest glimpse into the secretive industry of animal research and the processes that allow key details of what happened to be kept from the public.",
      "Three monkeys have remained on the loose since the crash on Tuesday in a rural area along Interstate 59, spilling wooden crates labeled \u201clive monkeys\u201d into the tall grass near the highway. Since then, searchers in masks, face shields and other protective equipment have scoured nearby fields and woods for the missing primates. Five of the 21 Rhesus macaques on board were killed during the search, according to the local sheriff, but it was unclear how that happened.",
      "Mississippi authorities have not disclosed the driver's name, the company involved in transporting the monkeys, where the monkeys were headed or who owns them. While Tulane University in New Orleans has acknowledged that the monkeys had been housed at its National Biomedical Research Center in Covington, Louisiana, it said it doesn't own them and won't identify who does.",
      "The questions surrounding the Mississippi crash and the mystery of why the animals were traveling through the South are remarkable, animal advocates say.",
      "\u201cWhen a truck carrying 21 monkeys crashes on a public highway, the community has a right to know who owned those animals, where they were being sent, and what diseases they may have been exposed to and harbored simply by being caught up in the primate experimentation industry,\u201d said Lisa Jones-Engel, senior science adviser on primate experimentation with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.",

      "\u201cTo the best of Tulane\u2019s knowledge, the 13 recovered animals remain in the possession of their owner and are en route to their original destination,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The crash has drawn a range of reactions \u2014 from conspiracy theories that suggest a government plot to sicken people to serious responses from people who oppose experimenting on animals.",

Employees from the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, South Carolina, set up traps to capture them. However, some spent two months that winter living in the woods and weathering a rare snowstorm.

Kennedy International Airport in New York on a flight from Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, authorities said. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all of the animals were accounted for within about a day, though three were euthanized for undisclosed reasons.",

      "GYEONGJU, South Korea -- Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia plans to supply hundreds of thousands of its graphics processing units for projects with South Korean businesses and the government to advance the country\u2019s artificial intelligence infrastructure and technologies.",
      "The plan was announced Friday by the government, Nvidia, and some of South Korea\u2019s biggest companies, including chipmakers Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and auto giant Hyundai Motor, after President Lee Jae Myung met with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.",
      "At a news conference, Huang said he hopes to export Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI chips to China, following U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on loosening U.S. chip restrictions as the two leaders pledged to reduce trade tensions.",
      "However, he acknowledged that it was up to Trump to decide, and said there were no current plans to sell the next generation Blackwell chips to China.",
      "Huang has gotten rockstar treatment reminiscent of Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs since arriving in South Korea on Thursday to attend meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Gyeongju. As APEC host, South Korea is using the gathering of world leaders to showcase its ambitions in AI.",

      "About 50,000 of the GPUs will be used to support a government project to build a national cloud computing center for AI and Nvidia will provide the same number of GPUs each to Samsung and SK to help them enhance their manufacturing processes through AI and accelerate the development of advanced semiconductors.",
      "Hyundai and Nvidia said they plan to collaborate on developing technologies related to self-driving cars, smart factories and robotics, a process that will be powered by 50,000 of Nvidia\u2019s advanced Blackwell GPUs.",
      "Speaking to business leaders, Huang highlighted how AI and advanced computing are driving a profound transformation across industries, adding to the need for more infrastructure and capacity. South Korea\u2019s strengths in software, technical expertise and manufacturing give it an edge, he said.",
      "\u201cWhen you combine software, AI technology, and manufacturing, you have the opportunity to really take advantage of robotics,\u201d which is the future of AI, Huang said.",

      "Nvidia has argued that U.S. export controls hinder American competitiveness in one of the world\u2019s largest technology markets and warned that such limits could push other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology. Talking to reporters in South Korea, Huang said he hopes to eventually sell Blackwell chips to China, \u201cbut that\u2019s a decision for the president to make.\u201d",

And so I\u2019m hopeful that both governments will arrive at a conclusion someday where Nvidia\u2019s technology could be exported to China.\u201d",
      "Huang acknowledged U.S. security concerns about Nvidia technology being used by China\u2019s military but argued that China already has ample AI capabilities, making the use of Nvidia chips for military purposes largely unnecessary.",
      "In August, Trump announced a deal with Nvidia and AMD, another chipmaker, to lift export controls on sales of advanced chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut of the revenue, despite concerns among national security experts that such chips will end up in the hands of Chinese military and intelligence services.",
      "Nvidia earlier this week confirmed that it has become the first $5 trillion company, just three months after the company broke through the $4 trillion mark. The milestone underscores the upheaval driven by the AI craze, widely seen as the biggest technological shift since Apple co-founder Jobs unveiled the first iPhone 18 years ago.",

The tech executives clinked glasses, took bomb shots, and at one point, Huang stepped outside to hand baskets of chicken and fried cheese to the crowd waiting outside.",
      "The three later took the stage before hundreds of cheering fans at a nearby gaming festival, where Huang said Korea\u2019s gaming scene aided Nvidia\u2019s early success back when it mainly made graphics cards for gamers.",

That was slightly below the 8% increase in iPhone sales that had been anticipated by analysts, and less than the 13% bump in sales during the April-June period.",
      "Buoyed by the iPhone results, Apple earned $27.5 billion, or $1.85 per share, nearly doubling its profit from a year ago. Revenue climbed 8% from a year ago to $102.5 billion. Both the earnings and revenue eclipsed the analyst forecasts that steer the stock market.",

      "Apple had promised a wide array of AI features would be rolling out on last year\u2019s iPhone models, but was only able to deliver a few of them. The missing upgrades included a smarter and more versatile version of its frequently flummoxed Siri virtual assistant \u2013 a makeover that Apple now doesn\u2019t expect to complete until next year.",

      "Instead, it\u2019s a testing ground for tiny drones that can be deployed in search and rescue missions even in dark, smoky or stormy conditions.",
      "\u201cWe all know that when there\u2019s an earthquake or a tsunami, the first thing that goes down is power lines. A lot of times, it\u2019s at night, and you\u2019re not going to wait until the next morning to go and rescue survivors,\u201d said Nitin Sanket, assistant professor of robotics engineering. \u201cSo we started looking at nature. Is there a creature in the world which can actually do this?\u201d",
      "Sanket and his students found their answer in bats and the winged mammal's highly sophisticated ability to echolocate, or navigate via reflected sound. With a National Science Foundation grant, they\u2019re developing small, inexpensive and energy-efficient aerial robots that can be flown where and when current drones can\u2019t operate.",
      "Last month, emergency workers in Pakistan used drones to find people stranded on rooftops by massive floods. In August, a rescue team used a drone to find a California man who got trapped for two days behind a waterfall. And in July, drones helped find a stable route to three mine workers who spent more than 60 hours trapped underground in Canada.",
      "But while drones are becoming more common in search and rescue, Sanket and researchers elsewhere want to move beyond the manually operated individual robots being used today. A key next step is developing aerial robots that can be deployed in swarms and make their own decisions about where to search, said Ryan Williams, an associate professor at Virginia Tech.",
      "\u201cThat type of deployment \u2014 autonomous drones \u2014 that is effectively nil,\u201d he said.",
      "Williams tackled that problem with a recent project that involved programming drones to choose search trajectories in coordination with human searchers. Among other things, his team used historical data from thousands of missing person cases to create a model predicting how someone would behave if lost in the woods.",
      "\u201cAnd then we used that model to better localize our drones, to search in locations with higher chances of finding someone,\u201d he said.",
      "At WPI, Sanket\u2019s project addresses other limitations of current drones, including their size and perception capabilities.",
      "\u201cCurrent robots are big, bulky, expensive and cannot work in all sorts of scenarios,\u201d he said.",

A small ultrasonic sensor, not unlike those used in automatic faucets in public restrooms, mimics bat behavior, sending out a pulse of high-frequency sound and using the echo to detect obstacles in its path.",
      "During a recent demonstration, a student used a remote control to launch the drone in a brightly lit room and then again after turning off all but a faintly glowing red light. As it approached a clear, Plexiglas wall, the drone repeatedly halted and backed away, even with the lights off and with fog and fake snow swirling through the air.",
      "\u201cCurrently, search and rescue robots are mainly operational in broad daylight,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cThe problem is that search and rescues are dull, dangerous and dirty jobs that happen a lot of times in darkness.\u201d",
      "But development didn\u2019t go completely smoothly. The researchers realized that the noise of the bat robot\u2019s propellers interfered with the ultrasound, requiring 3D printed shells to minimize the interference. They also used artificial intelligence to teach the drone how to filter and interpret sound signals.",
      "Still, there\u2019s a long way to go to match bats, which can contract and compress their muscles to listen only to certain echoes and can detect something as small as a human hair from several meters away.",
      "\u201cBats are amazing,\u201d Sanket said. \u201cWe are nowhere close to what nature has achieved. But the goal is that one day in the future, we will be there and these will be useful for deployment in the wild.\u201d",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- A fragment of a mask that was preserved for hundreds of years in permafrost sat in the muck of a low tide in the western Alaska community of Quinhagak. Wooden spoons, toys, a fishing lure and other artifacts were strewn, in some cases for miles, along the beach.",
      "The Yup'ik community near the edge of the Bering Sea was spared the widespread devastation wrought by the remnants of Typhoon Halong on its neighbors further west earlier this month. But it suffered a different kind of blow: The lashing winds and storm surge devoured dozens of feet of shoreline, disrupting a culturally significant archaeological site and washing away possibly thousands of unearthed artifacts.",
      "About 1,000 pieces, including wooden masks and tools, were recovered in Quinhagak after the storm ravaged parts of southwest Alaska on Oct. 11 and 12. But many more pieces \u2014 perhaps up to 100,000 \u2014 were left scattered, said Rick Knecht, an archaeologist who has worked on the Nunalleq, or old village, project for 17 years. That's roughly the number of pieces previously recovered from the archaeological site.",
      "Meanwhile, freezing temperatures and ice have settled into the region, stalling immediate efforts to find and recover more displaced artifacts on searches done by four-wheeler and foot.",
      "Knecht called what happened a major loss. The site has yielded the world's largest collection of pre-contact Yup'ik artifacts. Much of what's known about Yup'ik life before outsiders arrived stems from the project, said Knecht, an emeritus senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland.",
      "\u201cWhen there are holes or disturbances in the site, it\u2019s like trying to read a book with holes in the pages. You're going to miss a few things,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the bigger those holes are, the weaker the story gets. There\u2019s a few holes in the book right now.\u201d",
      "While the name of the original village isn't known, it was attacked by another village and burned around 1650, he said. Knecht has worked with elders and others in Quinhagak to combine their traditional knowledge with the technology and techniques used by the archaeology teams to study the past together.",
      "Quinhagak has about 800 residents, and subsistence food gathering is critically important to them.",
      "The storm dispersed artifacts from a site long preserved by permafrost, Knecht said. A longstanding concern has been the threat that climate change \u2014 melting permafrost, coastal erosion, the potential for more frequent or stronger storms \u2014 has posed to the site, he said.",
      "It poses risks to the community itself. Erosion threatens major infrastructure in Quinhagak, including a sewage lagoon, homes and fish camps. Thawing permafrost is also unsettling and undermining buildings, according to a 2024 report from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium.",

    "story": [
      "GOP officials said they are in better shape for 2026 than they were in 2022.",
      "Republican candidates running in the 2026 midterm elections are ramping up for a campaign cycle in lockstep with President Donald Trump, their party kingmaker who's keenly invested in their races, which will determine much about how the latter half of his second term will play out.",
      "National Republicans are focused on retaining control of both chambers of Congress during the elections, ensuring that the legislative portion of Trump's presidency can carry on. With Democratic control, they could ramp up investigations and oversight hearings that could put his administration on the defensive.",
      "The president is expected to be engaged in the midterms, campaigning for Republican candidates and having a hand in messaging and candidate selection, a Republican official close to the White House told ABC News, in order to prevent messy primaries or bids from non-Trump-aligned options.",
      "\"[The White House is] very involved in making sure we have the right candidates next year, that we're backing the right folks and that we're basically prepared and ready to go,\" the official told ABC News. \"The thinking basically started even before the president took office, like it's been a fantastic change compared to 2017, 2018.\"",
      "\"People on our side remember what it was like to deal with all of these investigations ... and how much it distracted and hurt the president's agenda. So I do think, especially on our side, when we're talking to our base, we're going to remind voters, you need to get out and vote to give the president a full four years.\"",
      "To win races, Republicans are strategizing on how to mobilize Trump voters, whose turnout has historically been lower in off-presidential election cycles, the Republican official and other GOP political operatives said. Ongoing pushes from Trump and other Republicans for mid-cycle redistricting in order to gain additional House seats are another way the party is shoring up its chances for victory.",
      "A year out from the midterms, an\u00a0ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\u00a0published on Sunday finds 46% of registered voters saying they would support the Democratic candidate in House races if the election were held today. That's a significant drop from a\u00a0November 2017 ABC News/Washington Post poll, when voters had an 11-percentage-point preference for Democratic candidates.",
      "\u201cWhile Democrats face historically low approval ratings, a Sanders\u2019 socialists vs. Schumer\u2019s favorites proxy war for control of their Party, and an identity crisis after a decade of standing for nothing except hating President Trump, Republicans are united behind an agenda of promises made, promises kept to American working families who want to see Washington focused on the issues that matter to them,\" National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez said in a statement to ABC.",
      "White House already involved in midterms",
      "The White House has already been visible, with Vice President JD Vance holding rallies in the battleground states of Michigan and Georgia.",
      "\"I hope you remember when you're voting in 2026, you have a choice between somebody who tried to fight for the illegal aliens and somebody who tried to fight against the drug cartels,\" Vance said in Howell, Michigan, on Sept. 17.",
      "Trump has confirmed what could be one of the largest mobilization strategies for the party-- a 'midterm convention' ahead of the 2026 races.",
      "\"The Republicans are going to do a Midterm Convention in order to show the great things we have done since the Presidential Election of 2024,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform in September.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats are cognizant of Republicans' ramped up mobilization efforts, attempting to counter them by making strides early to be more competitive in future races.",
      "\"One thing that the Republicans have done, and quite sophisticatedly, is they run a permanent campaign. They never stop organizing. They never stop communicating,\" DNC Chair Ken Martin said in an interview with ABC News. \"We're not going to wait until '28 to start campaigning for president. We're certainly not going to wait until '26 to start our work for the '26 elections.\"",

And that's a huge advantage we have.\"",
      "They're prepared to \"sink or swim\" with the president and sell his agenda to voters.",
      "\"I think everyone has said from the beginning that we are going to sink or swim with the president. He was just elected on a mandate. We feel that a lot of the policies that he's been able to deliver were promises made, promises kept, and the fact that he and the White House continue to message on that is going to be very important,\" one GOP political operative involved in 2026 midterm races, granted anonymity to discuss internal dynamics, told ABC News.",
      "Emphasis is still being placed on candidates to work on the infrastructure, fundraising and messaging to be well-positioned to run winning campaigns. Trump will be a \"big asset\" on the campaign trail, the operative said.",
      "\"The president's popularity, the president's agenda, are also going to be on the ballot in a certain way, and I think everyone is prepared to sell that to voters,\" the operative added.",
      "But\u00a0some of the president's individual agenda items remain unpopular. A majority of Americans also disapprove of how Trump is handling every issue measured in the ABC poll. Over 6 in 10 disapprove of how Trump is handling tariffs, the economy and managing the federal government.",
      "Still, some campaigns see Trump's presidential actions as a net positive, even in battleground states where industries such as manufacturing and agriculture are directly impacted by many of the White House's immigration and tariff moves.",

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., laughed off a question at the Capitol on Thursday about whether the issue, which is being seized upon by Democrats as a cornerstone topic ahead of the elections, would be able to aptly message on the matter heading into the midterms.",
      "\"It's going to be dominated by what party is making you safe and prosperous. It's not going to be dominated by subsidies. It's going to be dominated by the big stuff,\" he said.",
      "Republicans dedicated to avoiding contentious primaries, National Republican operatives say",
      "Republicans are not struggling this cycle with having many messy primaries, with the White House and the national Republican Party steering Republican candidates in key toss-up races in order to fend off messy primaries and secure swing districts with Trump-aligned candidates, the Republican official said, echoing several GOP operatives interviewed for this story.",
      "\"I think that speaks volumes about the way that we're operating this time, compared to what it was like during the first administration,\" the Republican official close to the White House said.",
      "They're also looking to leverage Democrats' apparent lack of party unity, which has contributed to several messy Senate primary fights in key battleground states like Maine, Michigan, Texas and Iowa.",
      "\"Our ducks are in a row,\" the official said, \"it's an advantage that the Democrats had in '22 that we didn't-- messy primaries this time around, that script is completely flipped.\"",
      "While Republicans have largely avoided significant MAGA proxy battles, a few have still percolated. In Kentucky, Trump has weighed in against Rep. Thomas Massie, endorsing the\u00a0six-term congressmember's challenger over his opposition to the GOP megabill that's been Trump's chief achievement on the Hill this Congress.",
      "In Louisiana, incumbent Sen. Bill Cassidy is facing several primary challengers after his past criticism of Trump.",
      "A messy primary is also brewing in Texas, but is viewed as less of a MAGA-on-MAGA battle, and more of a personal fight between Trump loyalist Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, who has also been a longtime ally of the president.",

    "story": [
      "Newsom has discarded Democrats' \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra.",
      "At the beginning of the year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom's tenure was marked by devastating wildfires in Los Angeles, a steady stream of ridicule from the White House, and backlash from within the Democratic Party for siding with conservatives on transgender athletes in women's sports.",
      "Not to mention, in the summer of 2021, Newsom weathered a blistering attempt to recall him from office -- his starpower at risk.",
      "Yet the twice-elected governor has pulled off a reputational heel turn, marked by viral Trump-mocking social media posts and parody MAGA merch coupled with a statewide redistricting measure that would level Republican's attempt to get an edge ahead of next year's midterms.",
      "Now, Newsom is a leader running miles ahead of others, experts explained to ABC News.",
      "One of the most noticeable transformations was the rebrand of Newsom's official governor social media account. A senior Newsom official told ABC that the weekend of June 6, when the team learned the president was federalizing the National Guard into Los Angeles, was when the \"red line\" was crossed, and a more defiant version of the Democratic governor debuted.",
      "\"That is when everything changed, with the governor, with our social media,\" the official said.",
      "On June 10, Newsom's @GovPressOffice account shared a TikTok video, where a voiceover, in the style of a Star Wars villain, mimicked Trump's TruthSocial post announcing the federalization of troops. That post generated over 800,000 views.",
      "The salvo continued. The same day, Newsom, on Instagram, responded to Trump mocking him as \"Newscum\" on Truth Social with a diss-video set to the Taylor Swift (another common Trump target) song \"You Need To Calm Down,\" dismissing Trump as \"keyboard warrior.\" That short video has 11.3 million views.",
      "The mocking never let up.",
      "'Newsom Derangement Syndrome'",
      "A non-exhaustive list of the incoming includes: accusing Trump of having \"Newsom Derangement Syndrome,\" a play on Trump's oft-referred \"Trump Derangement Syndrome;\" likening Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Voldemort, the villain from the Harry Potter series, and calling him submissive; calling Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"Kosplay Kristi\" and urging followers to \"hide yo dogs,\" a reference to Noem's infamous tale of shooting and killing her own dog, Cricket; mocking Vice President JD Vance over a debunked rumor that he performed sex acts with a couch; and comparing White House border czar Tom Homan to an uncooked ham.",
      "Since then, Newsom's social media accounts have skyrocketed. Follower counts across multiple platforms for his non-government account, @GavinNewsom, ballooned -- growing to more than 11 million followers collectively. Nearly half of those followers were new this year.",
      "One of the official accounts, @GovPressOffice, has seen nearly 1 billion impressions on X since those first provocative posts in June, per Newsom's campaign.",
      "Newsom even launched his own \"patriot\" merchandise shop, repurposing Trump's Make America Great Again slogan -- Make America Gavin Again -- and selling REAL PATRIOT hats NEWSOM WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING! And REAL PATRIOT hats, and kneepads marked with Trump's signature.",
      "A key mark in Newsom's success is upending the \"when they go low, we go high\" mantra coined by Michelle Obama in 2016, suggested Parker Butler, the former director of Kamala Harris' presidential campaign's buzzy social media channel, @KamalaHQ. \"That is not where we are right now.\"",
      "'It feels very unrestrained'",
      "\"When we see democracy hanging by a thread, we have to take risks. It feels very unrestrained, that's the kind of energy that I think Democrats need,\" said Butler, now a digital strategist and co-founder at Luminary Strategies.",
      "\"We need to throw the sort of old rulebook out the window,\" Butler added.",
      "When Newsom launched his new solo podcast \"This is Gavin Newsom\" in March, he said he wanted to \"debate without demeaning\" and engage with people most members his party wouldn't dare to speak to. He called the Democratic brand \"toxic.\" He's positioned himself as a lefty alternative in the GOP-de-jour manosphere space. His interview with Charlie Kirk, for instance, has 1.3 million YouTube views.",

Julianna was outraged with Newsom at the start of the year, in part due to his right-wing podcast guests, but she now considers herself a huge fan -- she's even bought his merch.",
      "\"I did not take Gavin Newsom seriously until he made it clear that he was ready to take action,\" Julianna added.",
      "'Holding a mirror to the clown show'",

      "Elliott said the buzz around Newsom's posts creates space for the \"actual substantive work,\" like Proposition 50, the ballot initiative that, if approved by voters on Tuesday,\u00a0will temporarily adopt a new congressional map that redraws five districts to be more Democratic-leaning, potentially flipping five existing Republican seats in the midterms. Elliott said that since the office has sharpened its tone, donations have poured in from millions of supporters.",
      "\"How do you get 1.2 million people from all 50 states all across the country to buy into this defense of democracy? You do it by getting attention,\" Eliott said.",
      "Newsom, in a recent interview with ABC News' Jonathan Karl, concurred.",
      "\"We're trying to have a little humor in this process as well, and we're fighting fire with fire, not just rhetorically, in the context of that back and forth, but substantively, we can get into the 43 lawsuits, we can get in the work we're trying to do on Prop 50,\" Newsom explained.",
      "John Dennis, former chair of the San Francisco Republican Party, said Newsom's tactic is the latest iteration of what he and other critics call a history of \"shapeshifting.\"",
      "\"He doesn't know who he is. So he's trying to be everybody else,\" Dennis said.",
      "But he admits it appears to be working.",
      "\"This Prop 50 move is a very clever move for the Democrats. And he's got good people around him,\" Dennis said. \"They know that Trump is the center of the universe right now so he's just keeping his name alive and positioning himself as the Trump fighter -- and he's going to run that all the way into the Democrat primaries.\"",
      "Dan Schnur, a longtime California political analyst and UC-Berkeley professor, called the Proposition 50 campaign \"a self-delivered political gift for Newsom.\"",
      "Newsom's successes put him in a solid position to launch a presidential bid, an ambition Californians are under no illusions about.",
      "\"Every governor looks in the mirror and sees a president looking back at them, and Newsom probably whistles \"Hail to the Chief\" when he's in the shower every morning,\" Schnur said. \"It's hard to predict exactly how the race plays out, but the governor of the largest state in the country, who is also the most visible and impactful Trump critic, and who has access to tremendous amounts of fundraising dollars could be a pretty formidable contender.\"",

      "\"We have winners. We have good stars.\"",
      "Democrats, in the throes of rebuilding their party can agree, at least, on one thing: they are fed up with being portrayed as losers.",
      "Several ABC News interviews with Democratic strategists, current and former national staffers, and state-level officials raise several questions from within the party of how to best shift perceptions ahead of the midterms: does the party go full bore on anti-Trump messaging as the navigate the politics of the ongoing government shutdown and voters feel the pinch? Do they focus, instead, on boosting progressive rising stars even as Republicans paint the party as too-radical?",
      "Some less conventional Democrats question whether the party should bother relying on the traditional leadership structure, who may lean too much on outdated tactics, in Washington at all. While other, more traditional members, argue they're not in as much disarray as their critics claim.",
      "Democrats in Washington point to recent wins as proof that their brand is not as toxic as some critics claim: two Republican legislative district flips in Iowa; electing a Democrat in a Pennsylvania state senate seat for the first time in 130 years; elevating a Democratic mayor to lead Omaha's blue dot, for example.",
      "They're banking on likely successes in the days-away gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey (and to a lesser extent, dominance in New York City's mayoral race) as reputational defibrillators a year out from the midterms.",
      "\"We have the momentum, certainly, heading into this final stretch,\" Democratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin told ABC News in a recent interview, of anticipated wins in New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania's supreme court races.",
      "Yet a\u00a0recent\u00a0ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll\u00a0found that more Americans say the Democratic Party is \"out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today\" (68%) than Trump (63%) and the Republican Party (61%).",
      "Asked on Sunday why more Americans feel this way about Democrats than the president -- even amidst the East Wing demolitions or a White House Halloween party hosted during the shutdown -- Martin suggested Republicans were in hotter water and disapproved of by Americans more.",
      "But pressed on what Democrats are doing to try to get more in touch with voters -- or why he thinks, even if there is a swing away from Trump, people still see the Democrats as out of touch -- Martin said he's confident the party is making strides regardless of what the polls say.",
      "\"I can't speak to that because I've seen a lot of other polls that suggest just the opposite, right? People are starting to put their trust and faith back in with the Democratic Party. And you know, I can tell you right now that you know, we've been out there having conversations with voters, growing our coalition,\" Martin said, adding that Trump's policies and actions are creating an opening for Democrats to have conversations with disillusioned voters.",
      "Democrats also hope to mine several lessons from their soon-to-be-released election analysis (don't call it a postmortem, members joke).",
      "One of Martin biggest takeaways from the report, he told ABC News, is that \"everyone just started their campaign way too late, and we had already been defined before we ever had a chance to define ourselves ... we cannot wait to talk to voters until the final few months before an election.\"",
      "Yet, some Democrats see their party's lower approval numbers (32%, per a recent Associated Press survey)\u00a0and believe they should pivot away from the traditional party apparatus.",
      "\"We are a party without a leader, and so there is no one to set the tone,\" a former DNC staffer and Democratic strategist told ABC News.",
      "They argue that there are vulnerabilities beyond the DNC, but also from more classical candidate recruitment from congressional leadership's political operation, who they suggested are not taking necessary risks on non-traditional picks. Sen. Chuck Schumer is reportedly facing resistance to his leadership among potential Senate candidates.",
      "A second former DNC staffer, who has since worked on presidential campaigns, put it more bluntly: \"The current iteration of the DNC has weakened itself out of relevance and should not be seen as anything but a fundraising vessel.\"",
      "Libby Schneider, deputy executive director of the DNC, concedes that it's typical after an election loss to be heartbroken and upset, and understands there may be some criticism in its wake. Despite that, she argues the committee is laser-focused on winning and wishes to be a tool to help candidates succeed.",
      "\"People can feel what they need to feel and grieve how they need to grieve about this loss, and we will change the things that we need to change in order to continue to perform well. But to me, people complaining tells me that they care a whole lot, and I think that that's valuable. And also, frankly, we can listen to that stuff and still do our jobs every day to elect Democrats,\" said Schneider.",
      "\"We went from being the party of cool with Barack Obama to turning into the party of nerds and dweebs and losers, right? What is really annoying about all of it is that we have winners. We have good stars,\" the second staffer continued. told ABC News.",
      "Obama has aligned himself, and whatever residual it-factor he possesses, with marquee political fights over the last few months: rallying Texas Democrats who broke quorum, in-person campaigning for both the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, boosting Democrats in Pennsylvania's supreme court elections, to cutting ads for Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting proposition.",

      "There's no consensus that Harris is the exciting nominee she once was -- though the first former DNC staffer suggests.",
      "\"She shouldn't be sent out to pasture -- she made the most out of an impossible situation for four years. At the same time, if we're serious about telling voters we're moving forward -- she can't be our nominee in 2028. Is she a leading voice in the party, yes? Should she be our main and only voice, absolutely not,\" the first former DNC staffer added.",
      "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has also been criss-crossing the country with rumored '28 candidate Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez drawing substantial crowds, meanwhile, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and Newsom have not shied away from their ambitions, either.",
      "Some Democrats argue that not having one main spokesperson presents an opportunity for the various stars, rising or seasoned, to sparkle.",
      "\"We have to be a tent that wins by addition and not subtraction,\" Schneider said. She feels confident ahead of Tuesday's elections, and believes that there's a strong case to be made to voters about Trump's impact on their bottom line, their health care premiums, their overall cost of living, as well as voters' souring on the president's handling of the economy and immigration.",
      "Per a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, roughly 6 in 10 Americans disapprove of Trump's handling of the job.",
      "And despite worries of disinterested donors and shrinking voter registration, the campaign arms of the party, taking cues from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, are outraising their Republican counterparts, even as the national party heavily lags in that arena. The DSCC raised nearly $20 million in Q3, versus the NRSC's $18 million, and the DCCC currently has a slight cash-on-hand edge, with $46.6 million to the NRCC's $45.8. A DNC official says the committee",
      "Former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who rebuilt the DNC as chair after the party's devastating losses in 2001, is bullish on his party's chances to sweep over the next year, as he believes droves of voters will reject Trump due to rising costs, shrinking access to health care, and negative impacts of the government shutdown, and trickle back to Democrats after this off-cycle election day.",
      "\"T\u200b\u200bhe Democratic Party is poised to take off like a booster rocket,\" said McAuliffe, who, a few weeks ago, hosted a packed fundraiser for Virginia's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Abigail Spanberger, at his home alongside the Clintons on behalf of the Democratic Governors' Association.",
      "McAuliffe said the 400-or-so attendees raised $2.2 million in one night -- proof, he argues, of his party's unquestionable desire to win. His message to hand-wringers and eye-rollers, even some within the party, echoes from what many at the top tell ABC: \"We need to be encouraged, people are counting on us to fight. I'm tired of the whining, complaining, the party of lemon suckers. Get in the game.\"",
      "Jaime Harrison, Martin's most recent predecessor at the DNC, realized the extent of his party's vulnerabilities during his 2020 Senate bid to unseat Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. (Santa Claus could run on Christmas as a Democrat and lose, he jokes.)",
      "Harrison worries about the perceptions of disjointedness, and suggested that various groups like the DGA, members of Congress, and the DNC convene for a joint-policy retreat \"so that people see we're all in alignment on our message, on our mission.\"",
      "Harrison also said he hopes the party seriously considers hosting a midterm convention, which could amplify their talent and hammer home their priorities. Schneider said a potential event is \"in the mix.\"",
      "\"The Democrats are looking for a unity of purpose, a unity of message, a unity of strategy. And it's important that the leadership right now provides that,\" said Harrison, who says he trusts Martin and believes support, from donors and otherwise, will return after Democratic wins on Tuesday.",
      "\"I'm not overly concerned. If we were in June of '26 and we're still not getting major donors, then I'm concerned. But we're not there yet,\" he added, expressing confidence in the continued grassroots support.",
      "Some Democrats also point to Martin's tenure as one that prioritizes infrastructure. For example, state parties now get major influxes of cash, to the tune of a million dollars a month, to hire staff, set up programs, and fortify their ranks. \"Party changing money,\" adds Schneider. Lauren Necochea, chair of the Idaho Democrats, told ABC News her chapter now has steady, monthly financial support.",
      "Texas Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the Lone Star State House Democratic caucus, said Jefferies and Martin gave his cohort full support to break quorum and attempt to block Republican redistricting efforts, a move that kicked off the party's more aggressive opposition to redistricting nationwide.",
      "Wu acknowledges that the perception of the Democratic Party is in peril, and is anxious for politicians to openly fight for the working class. He says voters, friends see Democrats as message-less, scolding hall monitors.",
      "\"People who would rather be right than win; people who would rather spend the time to tell other people how they're wrong instead of telling people what they would do about it and how they're going to fix it,\" Wu told ABC News.",
      "Wu said candidates need to be firmer on their beliefs, and his party must run candidates willing to take Republicans to task (like California's Gov. Newsom in his push to draw Democratic friendly maps) or face total failure.",
      "\"I think that the reality of where we are today and what the cost of failure will mean, I don't think people are under any illusion of where we are at this moment,\" said Wu, who added, \"this is not time for us to screw around ... I don't give a crap that you think Democrats are wimpy or whatever else. But if you want America to not suck anymore, you better join us.\"",

      "The man whose mistaken deportation galvanized opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies is charged in federal court in Tennessee with human smuggling",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies, has hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday in the human smuggling case against him in Tennessee.",
      "U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw will hear evidence on motions from the defense asking him to dismiss the charges and throw out some of the evidence.",
      "Here's what to know about the latest developments in the case:",
      "Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, where he faces danger from a gang that targeted his family.",
      "While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported and held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.",
      "Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, Trump's Republican administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges and asked Crenshaw to dismiss them.",
      "Abrego Garcia is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling, with prosecutors claiming he accepted money to transport within the United States people who were in the country illegally.",
      "The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security agent testified at an earlier hearing that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration must work to bring back Abrego Garcia.",
      "Abrego Garcia has asked Crenshaw to dismiss the smuggling charges on the grounds of \u201cselective or vindictive prosecution.\u201d",
      "In a recent ruling, Crenshaw found \u201csome evidence that the prosecution against him may be vindictive\" and said many statements by Trump administration officials \u201craise cause for concern.\" Crenshaw specifically cited a statement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, on a Fox News Channel program, that seemed to suggest the Justice Department charged Abrego Garcia because he won his wrongful-deportation case.",

      "Acting U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee Rob McGuire has argued in court filings that it doesn't matter what members of the Trump administration have said about Abrego Garcia.",
      "\u201cThe relevant prosecutorial decision-maker, the Acting U.S. Attorney, has explained on the record that this prosecution was not brought for vindictive or discriminatory reasons,\u201d McGuire writes in a court filing. He adds that any public statements by senior Trump administration officials about Abrego Garcia reflect public safety concerns that are \"plainly consistent with a legitimate motivation to prosecute him.\u201d",
      "Another motion from Abrego Garcia asks the judge to suppress evidence in the case. It claims the 2022 traffic stop that ultimately led to the smuggling charges was illegal, so evidence from that stop should not be used at trial.",
      "In support, court filings say the state trooper who pulled him over stated that the speed limit was 65 mph (105 kph) when it was actually 70 mph (113 kph). The trooper accused him of driving at 75 mph (120 kph), but there is no record that the trooper used a radar gun or pacing to gauge the speed. Abrego Garcia said he was driving at 70 mph, correctly noting the speed limit.",
      "Attorneys for the government argue that the trooper made an honest mistake. The speed limit decreases to 65 mph about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) farther down the interstate. The attorneys also note that Abrego Garcia was driving in the left lane \u201cconsistent with an individual traveling in excess of the posted speed limit.\u201d And the trooper, they said, had \"no reason or motivation to manufacture a traffic violation against him.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia currently can't be deported to El Salvador thanks to the 2019 settlement that found he had a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past couple of months government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.",
      "The administration\u2019s deportation agreements with so-called third countries have been contested in court by advocacy groups, which have noted that some immigrants are being sent to countries with long histories of human rights violations. But in June, a divided Supreme Court allowed the swift removal of immigrants to countries other than their homelands and with minimal notice.",
      "Abrego Garcia sued the Trump administration in a Maryland court over his earlier deportation, and the judge in that case has temporarily barred his removal. If the judge decides to lift that order, government attorneys have said they are ready to deport him right away.",
      "Meanwhile, Abrego Garcia has applied for asylum in the U.S. in immigration court.",

    "story": [
      "The Ultimate Fighting Championship\u00a0mixed martial arts company has cut fighter Issac Dulgarian, days after his loss by first round submission to Yadier del Valle during Saturday's Fight Night prompted a probe of possible pre-bout irregular betting patterns.",
      "This makes the UFC the latest sports entity navigating a possible gambling-related integrity issue, joining Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, which recently saw FBI arrests connected to a gambling investigation.",
      "Suspicious gambling activity was reportedly flagged after the odds on Dulgarian, the favorite, changed rapidly in the hours leading up to the bout, leading several major sports betting sites to stop taking wagers on the contest due to the betting patterns.",
      "The UFC said in a statement Monday: \"Like many professional sports organizations, UFC works with an independent betting integrity service to monitor wagering activity on our events. Our betting integrity partner, IC360, monitors wagering on every UFC event and is conducting a thorough review of the facts surrounding the Dulgarian vs. del Valle bout on Saturday, November 1. We take these allegations very seriously, and along with the health and safety of our fighters, nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport.\"",
      "The controversy may have played out in the Octagon. Cageside commentators Daniel Cormier and Michael Chiesa called the submission \"white belt stuff\" on air, implying that sloppy actions led to the loss.",
      "The integrity of specific UFC bouts has faced scrutiny before, most notably for contests involving former UFC veteran and coach James Krause. He was investigated for allegedly using his background in mixed martial arts to offer insights to offshore sportsbooks and bettors. Krause was also suspended by the UFC for failing to disclose a fighter's pre-fight injury. He was never charged with any crimes.",
      "The next UFC event is scheduled for Saturday at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The suit worn by Will Ferrell in the 2003 comedy hit \"Elf\" is going under the hammer at an auction of movie memorabilia in London this December, and the skin-tight green and yellow piece of Hollywood Christmas magic is expected to fetch over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "Bidding for the iconic suit, complete with the conical hat and matching tunic, will begin at 50,000 pounds, the equivalent of about $65,000, but it's expected to eventually sell for as much as 200,000 pounds, or about $261,000, when the hammer falls at the Propstore Winter Entertainment Memorabilia auction.",
      "According to the description on the Propstore Auction house's website, there are tags reading \"Mr. Ferrell\" on the inside of the tunic and the stockings, with \"Hero-3\" also handwritten on the tunic tag.",
      "The auctioneers say the belt also has \"Mr. Ferrell\" written on it in blue ink.",
      "Large movie productions often create several versions of the same props, but the term \"hero\" is typically used to describe the highly detailed iterations which are central to the plot and intended for close-up shots in the final cut of the movie.",
      "The suit going up for sale does not appear to be the same one that Ferrell wore to an NHL hockey game in Los Angeles just after Christmas last year, when he gave fellow sports fans a giggle by sitting near the ice looking disgruntled with a beer and a cigarette in the garish outfit.",
      "Another notable item up for sale in the December auction is Marty McFly's iconic hoverboard from the second and third installations of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, which is expected to sell for more than $156,000.",
      "According to the product description, it's the lightweight foam version of the prop, which actors used for scenes where their characters were seen carrying the boards, rather than a wooden version that Michael J. Fox and his fellow actors were seen riding in other parts of the movies.",
      "The example of the then-futuristic hoverboard does have some \"wear from use and age, including adhesive residue around the fastening strips, cracks in the foam, and paint chipping throughout,\" according to the auctioneers.",
      "The most valuable lot in the auction, however, will be the original prop used as Boba Fett's rifle in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
      "The auction house says it is the only known example of the prop. Other stunt versions and castings were made for later movies in the franchise, but, according to Propstore Auctions, this EE-3 carbine blaster has been \"identified by its serial number and photo-matched by details on the stock, directly confirming its provenance.\"",
      "The blaster, which started its life as a genuine 1917 Webley & Scott No.1 Mark I flare pistol, is expected to fetch the equivalent of around $915,000 when it goes under the hammer.",
      "The three day auction begins on Dec. 5 and will feature other iconic film memorabilia including Indiana Jones' fedora, worn by Harrison Ford in the 1984 \"Temple of Doom\" movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightweight lightsaber from 1999's \"Phantom Menace,\" and Jack Nicholson's stunt axe from the horror classic \"The Shining.\"",

      "\"It's a huge honor,\" Bailey, 37, told the magazine. \"Obviously, I'm incredibly flattered. And it's completely absurd.\"",
      "Bailey had audiences swooning as Prince Fiyero in his 2024 big-screen debut in \"Wicked,\" the popular movie musical in which he proudly urges fellow students to join him in his shallowness. The second half arrives in theaters Nov. 21.",
      "He dripped with charm as Lord Anthony Bridgerton on Netflix's \"Bridgerton,\" and earned a 2024 Emmy nomination for his role in the Showtime series \"Fellow Travelers.\" Most recently, he starred in \"Jurassic World Rebirth,\" which came out in July.",
      "Bailey told Fallon the title was an \"honor of a lifetime.\"",
      "\"I'm sort of thrilled that People magazine have invited someone in - bestowed this honor on someone who can really cherish the value of a sexy man,\" he said.",

      "He's had plenty of stage credits since then, including starring in Shakespeare's Richard II in London earlier this year.",
      "Bailey, who has spoken openly about being a gay actor, founded The Shameless Fund, which helps to support LGBTQ+ organizations.",

      "The first Sexiest Man Alive was Mel Gibson in 1985. Other past recipients include Brad Pitt, George Clooney, John F. Kennedy Jr., David Beckham, Michael B. Jordan, John Legend, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Rudd, Pierce Brosnan and Patrick Dempsey.",

      "Her daughter, Laura Dern, said in a statement that she was by Ladd's side when she passed at her home in Ojai, California.",
      "\"She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,\" Dern said. \"We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.\"",
      "Dern's statement didn't immediately cite a cause of death.",
      "In 2023, the mother and daughter told \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that the two began taking daily walks in Santa Monica after learning that Ladd had developed a lung disease, believed to be caused by exposure to pesticides. Dern was told her mother only had six months to live.",
      "That's when the two had conversations that eventually filled the pages of \"Honey, Baby, Mine,\" their joint memoir named for an old folk song Ladd's father used to sing. They discussed everything, starting with Ladd's marriage and divorce from Laura's father, actor Bruce Dern, to her efforts to discourage Laura from joining the family business.",
      "\"She was only, like, 11 years old, and I said, 'Don't be an actress. Be a doctor, be a lawyer,'\" Ladd said. \"Nobody cares if you put on weight or your chin points when you cry if you're a doctor. They just want you to be the best you can be. But an actress? They care, care, care, care, care.\"",
      "But Dern said there was no stopping her from being in movies: \"No. It is all I knew.\"",
      "A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was apparently destined to stand out. In her 2006 memoir, \"Spiraling Through the School of Life,\" she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day be in \"front of a screen\" and would \"command\" her own audiences.",
      "By the mid-1970s, she had lived out her fate well enough to tell The New York Times that she no longer denied herself the right to call herself great.",
      "\"Now I don't say that,\" she said. \"I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70.\"",
      "A gifted comic and dramatic performer, Ladd had a long career in television and on stage before breaking through as a film performer in Martin Scorsese's 1974 release \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\" She earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actor for her turn as the acerbic, straight-talking Flo, and went on to appear in dozens of movies over the following decades.",
      "Her many credits included \"Chinatown,\" \"Primary Colors\" and two other movies for which she received best supporting nods, \"Wild at Heart\" and \"Rambling Rose,\" both of which co-starred her daughter. She also continued to work in television, with appearances in \"ER,\" \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"Alice,\" the spinoff from \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" among others.",
      "Through marriage and blood relations, Ladd was tied to the arts. Tennessee Williams was a second cousin, and first husband Bruce Dern, Laura's father, was himself an Academy Award nominee. Ladd and Laura Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in \"Rambling Rose.\"",

    "story": [
      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, appears set to be stripped of his last honorary military title as the British royals continue their efforts to distance themselves from King Charles III's younger brother over his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"We've seen Andrew surrender the military positions that he's had and we're looking now at the one remaining position he has, which is the honorary vice admiral position, and we've got a process underway for that\" to be removed, Defense Secretary John Healey told Britain's Sky News on Sunday.",
      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",
      "\"That's been a tragic situation,\" he said. \"And, I mean, I feel badly for the family.\"",

      "\"Do you go out of your way to understand that there is this perceived gap between you and others?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Clooney said. \"I didn't grow up around fame. I mean, my father was a newscaster in Cincinnati, Ohio. My aunt [Rosemary Clooney] was a famous singer, but I'd met her three times. So, when I met someone famous, I was always like, Oh my God! And so, I always try to remind people that, honest to God, this is the job that I do and that, you know, we're all fairly normal.\"",
      "\"Why is that so important to you?\" I asked.",
      "\"I think because I was raised not only that you treat everyone equally, but that everyone treats you equally as well.\"",
      "Clooney is pretty disarming, as we saw while setting up the interview. Asked if he wanted to check how he looked in the camera, he smiled: \"No, I don't care. I'm too old to give a s*** anymore.\"",
      "\"You are, for many, kind of the poster man of aging gracefully.\"",
      "\"That's why I'm wearing these glasses,\" Clooney said, \"because for the record, I have a horrible sinus infection. If I take these off ...\" He demonstrated for us. \"You see the problem?\"",
      "\"How much does aging factor in \u2026 Do you see parts changing?\"",
      "\"I see parts on my body changing,\" he replied. \"I'm like, that fell off? How'd that fall off?\"",
      "\"I didn't mean that.\"",
      "\"Oh sure, parts have changed significantly.\"",
      "He's 64 now, married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. The two juggle Hollywood glamour with social justice work through their foundation. They have eight-year-old twins, and the actor (once famously single) says family life suits him \u2013 another thing that sets him apart from this character. \"Fame, [Jay] actually does really well. And I'm kind of the opposite of that in a way.\"",
      "What do you mean? \"I feel I'm a better parent, I hope, certainly husband. And fame, if there was one of the two, that would be the one I'm least comfortable with.\"",
      "\"Wow, you seem to be quite comfortable with fame and celebrity,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, you know, you got to put on your famous outfit when you come here to do a film premiere.\"",
      "\"But you know everywhere you go, people watch you. Is it performative?\"",
      "\"Sometimes it's performative,\" Clooney replied. \"I mean, listen, you don't get caught picking your nose, you know? You have to be more aware than other people would be.\"",
      "I asked, \"You seem to have this desire to keep some things for yourself, but then you can also be very political and really stick yourself out there.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, yeah,\" Clooney said. \"I try to do it when I think I have a responsibility to it. My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you, and protect people with less power. One of the things you understand is, you can't take on every fight. You have to pick things. I worked on trying to help solve some of the problems in Darfur in the early 2000s. Failed. You fail more often than you succeed. But it doesn't mean you don't keep trying. We still work there, we're still involved.\"",
      "He also does not regret writing that opinion piece in The New York Times, urging President Biden to drop out. \"To not do it would be to say I'm not going to tell the truth,\" he said.",
      "While Clooney does not shy from public activism, he gets some help guarding his private life at the family's place in Italy: \"Italian towns adopt you, Like, people come up and say, 'Which house is George Clooney's?' They go, 'Hey, he doesn't live here, he doesn't.' They protect you.\"",
      "Right now, Clooney considers France home. \"We live on a 750-acre farm, and our kids run around. We wanted them to have something of a normal existence.\"",
      "\"And you find that on a 750-acre ranch?\"",
      "\"Well, you find it on a farm, and you find on a very small school and very sort of farming community. We found a real peace there.\"",
      "He prizes that peace. In the film, Jay Kelly is searching for what George Clooney already has: a sense of self and balance. Clooney really does seem to have it all.",
      "I said, \"If people say, What was it like being with George Clooney? One of the things I'm going to say is, well, I was sitting here sweating, and somehow he didn't seem to sweat.\"",
      "\"I don't sweat!\" Clooney laughed. \"It's a funny thing. I don't sweat much when I'm on camera, funnily enough. I don't know why. I put ice cubes under my arms!\"",
      "But like the rest of us, he still has to contend with the passing of time. \"I want to work, but I don't want to fill my life with work,\" he said. \"When I turned 60, Amal and I talked about it, and I said, 'Look, I can still play basketball with the boys, I can still hang out. But in 25 years I'll be 85. And that's a real number.'",
      "\"And things change, and it doesn't matter how many granola bars you eat; it catches you. So, we have to focus on making sure we work. We also have to have focus on spending time with the people we love. More time, because at the end of your life, you don't go, I wish I'd worked more.\"",

    "title": "Salman Rushdie on \"The Eleventh Hour\" and free speech",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salman-rushdie-on-the-eleventh-hour-and-free-speech/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:37:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The author talks about his first fiction published since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him; his own immigrant experience in the U.S.; and what happens when freedom of speech dies.",
    "story": [
      "Salman Rushdie recently turned up at a McNally Johnson bookstore near South Street Seaport in Manhattan. \"It's actually not particularly close to where I live, but I come here a lot,\" he said.",
      "He was browsing for his own books. His newest one, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" is his 23rd \u2013 a collection of short stories and novellas.",
      "Life has changed since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him. \"I think what has changed is, for public-facing things, then there has to be security in a way that there wasn't for 20 years,\" he said.",
      "On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was on stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., ready to speak, ironically about America as a safe haven for writers. A man lunged at him with a knife.",
      "His account of the attack, \"Knife,\" was published in 2024: \"I raise my left hand in self-defense. He plunges the knife into it. ... After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.\"",
      "Rushdie lost the sight in his right eye. \"I can still read,\" he said, \"but I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to. Because there's light, and because I can adjust the size of the type. So, I never, ever, read a book on an iPad, but now I do.\"",
      "His left hand and liver were badly damaged, but he lived, which he considers \"a miracle.\"",
      "In May of this year, Rushdie's attacker, Lebanese-American Hadi Matar, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors argued he was acting on the fatwa, the 1989 order by Iran's leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, to kill the author, claiming passages in his fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" insulted Islam.",
      "Recognized just for his fiction before, suddenly Rushdie was world famous (to some, infamous) for the fatwa. After nearly a decade in hiding, protected 24/7 by British security, Rushdie emerged and moved to New York, thinking times had changed. But he was wrong.",
      "Yet the author does not seem bitter or angry. \"I think that's who I am,\" he said.",
      "I suggested, \"Most people would say, well, this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have a therapist,\" Rushdie said, \"and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD. And I said, 'But I don't seem to be having those symptoms, so what's wrong with me?' And he said, 'Well, it's because you're a bad-ass, that's the technical term.'\"",
      "The new book is the first fiction he's published since the attack.",
      "So, why \"The Eleventh Hour\"? \"Well, for a start, I'm 78,\" he said. \"For another thing, I had a fairly intimate encounter with death, you know, and got away with it. But it makes you think, you know? So, I thought this idea of running out of time was something I had on the brain.\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America\"",
      "\"Now you have entered the magic space of my childhood,\" the fictional narrator of one story says, as he takes a last walk up the hill to the neighborhood where the real Salman Rushdie grew up, in Mumbai, India (which he still calls Bombay). \"My relationship with the place is kind of elegiac now,\" Rushdie said. It's a relationship about something that has passed.",
      "He left India for an English boarding school at the age of 13. He left Britain after nearly 40 years there. He became an American citizen in 2016. Rushdie sees his place in the world through the eye of an immigrant.",
      "Asked what he felt after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rushdie said, \"I remember getting into a cab, leaving the office where I'd been sworn in, and being driven back through the streets of the city, and it felt different. I thought, Oh, I can belong. And it felt very good.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did the feeling that you had when you were sworn in as a citizen become fractured or altered based on what's happened since, both in public life in the United States, and to you?\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America, but it's a hard time all over,\" he replied. \"If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less-good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.\"",
      "\"The Eleventh Hour\" includes a ghost story, characters who get even, a writer who disappears. But the book is also political. He writes: \"Words such as good and bad or right and wrong are losing their effect, emptying of meaning, and failing anymore to shape society.\"",
      "The meaning of words matters to Rushdie, who has spent his entire career advocating for free speech, even though exercising it nearly got him killed.",
      "He said, \"The final story in the collection, 'The Old Man in the Piazza,' is kind of an allegory of that. In fact, free speech, to my great surprise, language itself, turned into a character, a female character. She just walked into the story and sat down in a corner, and I hadn't expected her at all.\"",
      "\"She is in fact a very old language, one of the oldest and richest\u2026\" he writes, in a story about what happens when speech is restricted. \"It's even possible, though it's hard for her to admit this, even to herself, that she may die. Nobody's listening. Nobody cares.\"",
      "Language abandons her corner, leaving people no longer able to speak:\u00a0\"We are at a loss to know how things will proceed. Our words fail us.\"",
      "\"That's pretty startling and scary,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Rushdie agreed. \"It's supposed to be.\"",

      "From \"In the South\"",
      "The day Junior fell down began like any other day: the explosion of heat rippling the air, the trumpeting sun\u00adlight, the traffic's tidal surges, the prayer chants in the distance, the cheap film music rising up from the floor below, the pelvic thrusts of an \"item number\" dancing across a neigh\u00adbor's TV; a child's cry, a mother's rebuke, unexplained laughter, scarlet expectorations, bicycles, the newly plaited hair of school\u00adgirls, the smell of strong coffee, a green wing flashing in a tree. Senior and Junior, two very old men, opened their eyes in their bedrooms on the fourth floor of a sea-green building on a leafy lane, just out of sight of Elliot's Beach, where, that evening, the young would congregate, as they always did, to perform the rites of youth, not far from the village of the fisherfolk, who had no time for such frivolity. The poor were puritans by night and day. As for the old, they had rites of their own and did not need to wait for evening. With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.",
      "Almost at once they began to speak. Their words were not new. These were ritual speeches, obeisances to the new day, of\u00adfered in call-and-response format, like the rhythmic dialogues or \"duels\" of the virtuosi of Carnatic music during the annual December festival.",
      "\"Be thankful we are men of the south,\" said Junior, stretch\u00ading and yawning. \"Southerners are we, in the south of our city in the south of our country in the south of our continent. God be praised. We are warm, slow, and sensual guys, not like the cold fishes of the north.\"",
      "Senior, scratching first his belly and then the back of his neck, contradicted him at once. \"In the first place,\" he said, \"the south is a fiction, existing only because men have agreed to call it that. Suppose men had imagined the earth the other way up! We would be the northerners then. The universe does not under\u00adstand up and down; neither does a dog. To a dog there is no north and south. And in the second place, you're not that warm a character, and a woman would laugh to hear you call yourself sensual\u2014but you are slow, that is beyond a doubt.\"",
      "This was how they were: they fought, going at each other like ancient wrestlers whose left feet were tied together at the ankles. The rope that bound them so tightly was their name. By a curious chance\u2014which they had come to think of as \"des\u00adtiny,\" or, as they more often called it, a \"curse\"\u2014they shared a name, a long name like so many names of the south, a name neither of them cared to speak. By banishing the name, by re\u00adducing it to its initial letter, V., they made the rope invisible, which did not mean it did not exist. They echoed each other in other ways\u2014their voices were high, they were of similarly wiry build and medium height, they were both nearsighted, and, after lifetimes of priding themselves on the quality of their teeth, they had both surrendered to the humiliating inevitabil\u00adity of dentures\u2014but it was the unused name, that symmetrical V., the Name That Could Not Be Spoken, that had joined them together for decades.",
      "The two old men did not share a birthday, however. One was seventeen days older than the other. That must have been how \"Senior\" and \"Junior\" got started, even though the nicknames had been in use for so long that nobody could now remember who originally thought them up. V. Senior and Junior they had become, Junior V. and Senior V. forevermore, quarreling to the death. They were eighty-one years old. If old age was thought of as an evening, ending in midnight oblivion, they were well into the eleventh hour.",
      "\"You look terrible,\" Junior told Senior, as he did every morn\u00ading. \"You look like a man who is only waiting to die.\"",
      "Senior\u2014nodding gravely, and also speaking in accordance with their private tradition\u2014responded, \"That is better than looking, as you do, like a man who is still waiting to live.\"",

      "K\u014cRERO: THE PAST IS THE FUTURE",
      "I'd opened my share of graves before finding something of value: a pendant in the shape of a fishhook, carved from greenstone. Greenstone only came from Aotearoa, the land our people had fled before we ended up on this island. The pendant, when held to the sun, glowed soft and green as dawn through miro trees. I was of the third generation born on this island, but the pendant was from our ancestors, from before. My father said a fishhook necklace had a special meaning: it ensured seafarers safe passage over water. To wear the pendant, I braided a cord from the inner bark of a hibiscus branch, which produced a fiber so strong, even parrots couldn't bite through it.",
      "Unpleasant as it was, and offensive to our ancestors, I was ready to open more graves.",
      "Still, I had other duties to perform. I was up each morning before dawn to hunt birds. Pigeons in planting season, t\u016b\u012b birds when the flax blossomed. This time of year, it was parrots. They arrived on our island in closely bonded flocks, and it was these social connections we'd exploit to ensnare them. When our ancestors landed on this island, it was so full of birds, they named it Manumotu, or Bird Island. If only that were still the case. These days, we'd quietly crouch all morning, ready to trigger our snares, in the hopes of catching a bird or two. The worst part was the silence. I'm the talkative type. My mother says I was born speaking, which is why she named me K\u014drero. Only after hours of silent birding was I free to open graves with my best friend Hine. The two of us could talk all day.",
      "Hine's duties, unlike mine, were endless. She'd been but a girl when her mother died and she was given to an older, childless woman named Tiri. But after a few years, when Tiri went blind, it was Hine who became the caretaker. Tiri was one of the most amazing persons in the world \u2014 I admit I only knew eighty-four people \u2014 but Hine, like me, was sixteen years old, and nobody likes it when they have to do something. And Hine had to do everything for Tiri.",
      "After birding on the morning this story begins, I arrived at our island's cove to continue digging. Many people trapped on this island before us were buried around the cove. This was considered a good resting place because of the view and the breeze and because this was where birds landed after open-water voyages. Where'd the birds come from? I always wondered. Where'd they fly off to?",
      "I tethered my parrots to a branch. One was named Aroha \u2014 it was she who lured the wild parrots into our traps. I'd tug on Aroha's tether, she'd squawk in distress, and wild parrots would come to her aid.",
      "\"I ohiti r\u0101,\" I said to Aroha. \"I ohiti p\u014d.\"",
      "This was a fisherman's adage, shortened to fit a bird's memory. Alert by day, the saying went. Alert by night. My father was a fisherman.",
      "I knew from old stories that parrots could be made to talk, though I'd had no luck at it.",
      "The other parrot was freshly caught. We'd named her Kanokano \u2014 the complications she caused are soon to be described.",
      "With only a digging stick and a basket, I picked a likely spot on the upper beach and began moving sand. If only our ancestors had thought to mark their graves. But I suppose they didn't imagine being exhumed by their great-granddaughters. I ran into a lot of mangrove roots, which I hacked with the jagged edge of a mussel shell. By the time Hine and Tiri arrived, I was sweating.",
      "\"What's the ocean like today?\" Tiri asked. Her pearled-over gaze was directed at nothing.",
      "Hine rolled her eyes and helped the old woman onto a mat before handing her her weaving.",
      "\"It's blue, it's wet,\" Hine said impatiently. \"The waves go up and down.\" I described for Tiri how late-morning light penetrated the cove, illuminating the humps of mullet, how the distant reef-break frothed like coconut pulp, how sputtering waves reached up the beach before fingering all the little shells in retreat.",
      "Hine half-heartedly stabbed at some sand with her stick.",
      "I asked, \"Did you hear the Toki brothers found an earring in a grave?\" I was arm-deep in the hole, fighting roots.",
      "\"The Toki brothers are insufferable,\" Hine said. She made a gesture to help me, but looking in the hole saw I was already to the point where smelly water was seeping in.",
      "\"The earring was greenstone,\" I said. \"From the old world. I bet one of the brothers brings it to you. Will it be the big, handsome, doltish one? Or the big, handsome, inane one?\"",
      "\"Don't make fun of me,\" Hine said. \"You'll have to marry the one I reject. And have his baby.\"",
      "The Toki brothers were slow-witted, trusting, and humorless. But their father was charismatic and funny, and the truth was, Hine had a parent-crush on him. It was quite possible that when the marriage ban was lifted, she'd marry a Toki brother just to become the daughter of Papa Toki.",
      "Tiri took a breath. She always did that before beginning a story. While Hine had no patience for the old tales, I could hear them all day. Today was the story of Paikea, who was one of the navigators who discovered Aotearoa. He was from a place called Hawaiki. Tiri didn't start in the obvious places, like Paikea's departure from Hawaiki or his arrival at Aotearoa. She didn't start with Paikea sinking a canoe and drowning his seventy enemies. Nor with him being saved by a whale. Instead, she started that epic tale with a little moment: Paikea, succumbing both to vanity and shame, as he groomed his hair with a forbidden comb.",
      "All the while, Tiri did her weaving \u2014 her fingers displaying their own kind of sight.",
      "My hole reached the point where sand fell in as fast as I scooped it out. Hine scrunched her nose. It's probably clear that Hine's heart really wasn't into digging up graves. She could barely bring herself to touch any bones, and when she did, she was afraid they might belong to her mother, even though we knew her mother was buried up the hill, above the k\u016bmara fields. We'd both been there when she was put in the ground. Still, one person's bones can look like another's, which can look like anybody's, which might as well be your mother's. I hoped Hine would change her outlook when she finally found something of value in a grave.",
      "That's when my digging stick made the unmistakable knock of wood striking bone.",
      "Tiri paused her story. I reached into the dark water and felt something in the muck. Hine winced, afraid of what I'd pull out. \"I'm sorry, ancestor,\" I said. Then, with a sucking sound, I tugged out a dog skull. I reached back for its jaw, but the mud offered only bird bones and broken shells.",
      "\"Another junk pit,\" Hine said, and started pushing sand back into the hole.",
      "I contemplated the skull. Since we'd begun digging up the dead, I'd come across many dog remains. Did they happen to die at the same time as our ancestors? Were they slain and buried alongside? Or was it something else altogether? No living person on the island had ever seen a dog, and before we started digging, it was thought that dogs had never even been here.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked.",
      "\"Another dog skull,\" Hine said. \"Look at those teeth. Who'd want to get close to one of those things, let alone share the afterlife with it?\"",
      "\"Dogs had white fur, soft as t\u016b\u012b feathers,\" Tiri said. \"The old stories say they'd lick your face.\"",
      "\"They supposedly had long tongues,\" I said, marveling at the skull. Hine shook her head. \"You don't believe every story you hear, do you?\" Hine knew that I did, indeed, believe every story I heard.",
      "\"There's only one thing we know for sure about dogs,\" Hine said. \"They must've tasted good.\"",
      "What interested me was the size of a dog's eye sockets. K\u0101k\u0101 parrots also had large eyes. In fact, the eyes of a parrot were quite intelligent and expressive. \"Ancestors are supposed to be wise,\" I said. \"But they didn't leave us a single dog.\"",
      "Hine eyed its fangs. \"I'm glad they're gone.\"",
      "\"Parrots have sharp beaks,\" I said. \"And they're friendly.\" Hine took the skull and threw it.",
      "\"One of these days, you'll lose a finger to those birds,\" she said.",
      "Already, I've forgotten some stuff. That's how bad a storyteller I am. I should've mentioned that I was absolutely forbidden from teaching my parrots human words, that Hine had a father who was alive and walking around our island \u2014 we just didn't know his identity. That Papa Toki had lost an arm, with my mother and Tiri being the ones who cut it off.",
      "But it's too late, the story's begun. Aroha looked toward the cove, spread her wings, and began screeching. We turned. Drifting in past the reef was the largest waka canoe imaginable. It had two hulls and rocked silently with the waves. Most canoes in the old stories were waka taua, war canoes. This one seemed empty \u2014 not a person or a paddle or a sail was visible. We beheld its pitched bows and soaring mast. Most ominously, the symbol of a death-bringing frigate bird was carved down its side. Then we heard it: upon the spar was a large parrot with a crimson body. It had spread its wings and was screeching back.",
      "\"What is it?\" Tiri asked. \"What's going on?\"",
      "\"We have visitors,\" Hine said. She took my hand in hers, and then she screamed.",
      "It seemed to me that, at the sound of Hine's voice, dozens of warriors would sit up in the waka and reveal themselves. I took hold of my fishhook necklace because, like the waka before me, it felt both ancient and startlingly new.",
      "Did I mention that in all our years on the island, we'd never had a visitor? As Hine's scream echoed off the cliffs, the hum of island life stopped.",
      "Silenced were the sounds of flax being beaten on the leeward shore and of our fathers excavating burial sites on the south-facing bluffs.",
      "Our fathers \u2014 all the men of Bird Island \u2014 would be here in no time.",
      "I should say the waka wasn't a total surprise. We knew something was coming. There'd been signs.",

      "Dear Reader,",
      "You are eighteen years old. Cast out by your father, shunned by society, you have fled to Geneva with your lover and your sister. The closeness of their relationship makes you furious, but if you protest, your lover will abandon you. Confined by terrible storms, you find yourself in a house with your lover, your sister and Lord Byron, an infamous and magnetically attractive poet. You know he is dangerous, but you find yourself drawn to him. When he sets a challenge to write a ghost story, all the turmoil that has boiled within you finds a voice.",
      "The anger pours from your pen in a roar of rage. Even as the monster that emerges terrifies you, you understand that it belongs to you. This creature that crawls across the page is the woman you were always meant to be. And in Byron, this furious beast that you have kept hidden for so long may have found a mate. You are eighteen years old. The creature you have created will howl its way onto page and stage and screen, burning its path across history in its desire to be seen, to be known, to be loved. The monster will never be silenced. Neither will you.",
      "Prologue",
      "Geneva, 1816",
      "At dusk, the sky over Lake Geneva is the colour of blood in a glass of water. The ash fragments falling over the city form a strange fog \u2013 a thickening of the air, which swirls through the deserted streets, past the spire of the old cathedral and over the walls of the new Protestant church. Inside, people are on their knees, praying for the uncanny cloud to lift. It is a judgement, they fear, a punishment from God, or else a curse.",
      "This night, like so many before it, the choking dust has driven the residents of the city into the shelter of shuttered houses and places of prayer. Outside, there is no one to witness the way the ash gleams as it settles on the lake. The water flickers and shimmers, each tiny filament glowing like a candle, sinking into the silence, quickly snuffed out.",
      "The lake is chill and dark and deep \u2013 not even the fishermen have fathomed its depths, or the small children who, on any other evening, would be taking turns to dive beneath the surface, competing to see who could swim down the furthest, stay under the longest.",
      "No one is standing on the lake's stony shores to watch the water's surface glow, red as the strange sky above. No one is there to see the darkness beneath the water shift and stir and coalesce, parting for a breath, like two slick thighs, which fall back into the darkness with a gasp that is almost human.",
      "Above, half masked by cloud, a thin slash of moon hangs hazy and indifferent. A lone figure stumbles down to the lake and scrambles into a small rowboat that one of the fishermen has left bobbing at the end of a long line. Looking right, then left, the man leans forward over the rope. Flash of steel from the blade in his hand. A quick tug and the boat is free. The man settles himself on the rocking boards, tugging the oars. No one will see him on this cloud-deadened, mist-muffled night. No one will stop him. Still, his breath stutters and stumbles. He must be quick. His hands ache, his chest burns. His eyes feel gritty as the mist parts before him, then closes around him, giving him the strange sensation of being swallowed.",

      "From the storeroom hidden under the stairs, Ma fetched a cup of rice and a sack of eggs speckled gray like the moon, then cooked, standing before the stove's blue fire, her eye upon the window and its dusk, in which bats swooped and the neem tree shivered and a figure down on the road pedaled a bicycle, whistling, as if everything was all right.",
      "Thief, thought Ma. Who else but a person who had chanced upon fresh vegetables or fruit would wander the city of Kolkata in this ruined year, the heat a hand clamped upon the mouth, the sun a pistol against one's head, and recall a song? She watched to see what the thief would do. He pedaled past. But Ma saw a different reality shimmer into being, in which he leaned his bicycle against the wall, climbed the pipes like a toddy tapper, and appeared at her window. In that picture, the thief was a collector of local information, dutiful in his neighborhood eavesdropping, shrewd in following what he heard about the bins of onions and carrots, the sacks of lentils and rice, the bags of raisins and cashews hidden in the dark fist of the house, stolen by Ma from donations made to the shelter where she worked, while the city outside wept for a handful of something to eat.",
      "There was \u2014 in the label accepted by the region \u2014 a shortage.",
      "In the year prior to this day, farmers across the region had fallen, their bodies running fevers in air that no longer cooled. In the croplands, among stilled machines, pests had traveled from acre to new acre, savage in their feeding of grains. In the west a drought had cleaved riverbeds and in the east salt water had tainted the paddy fields. In the city, those who walked to the neighborhood markets with umbrellas in their hands and wishful lists in their pockets, broad corners torn from the newspaper with writing in Bengali \u2014 cabbage, ginger, lychees if they were good, ice cream, half loaf of bread \u2014 found the roads alongside which the markets usually sat, its baskets and tarps invading, rickshaws and cars sounding their horns, slow shoppers inspecting the purple shine of eggplant and pressing guavas hard as hail, instead completely empty, nothing but some onion peel scattered at the edges where the pavement gave way to earth, where on most days goats and cows might have nudged the soil for something to eat. But those animals were gone too.",
      "It had happened before. 1770, when crops failed and smallpox plagued the enfeebled. 1876, when drought struck the Deccan Plateau and the British continued to export what grain remained. 1943. Those black-and-white newspaper photos, in which people appeared as sunken eyes and twig-thin limbs, facing a photographer who could do nothing for them, their fullness \u2014 their love, their humor, their annoyance, their preference \u2014 pared by the lens to reveal what remained, which was hunger.",

      "Member's Mark Super Greens Powder Supplements, which were sold at the discount chain's stores nationwide and online, have been pulled from store shelves because they contain moringa leaf powder that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an alert posted on its website.",

      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-airspace-government-shutdown-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy/",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency may need to close \"certain parts\" of the nation's airspace if the shutdown drags on.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation may need to close \"certain parts of the airspace\" if the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on record continues into next week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" Duffy said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "He added, \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe.\"",
      "Throughout the 35-day federal shutdown, set to become the longest in U.S. history, Duffy has maintained that commercial air travel remains safe. The tradeoff is that passengers are experiencing more flight delays as officials slow flight traffic based on staffing levels to ensure that the national airspace remains well-monitored, Duffy\u00a0has said at earlier press conferences.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while an additional 4,700 trips were delayed on Monday, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "Duffy said on social media on Wednesday that 46% of the previous day's flight delays were due to staffing issues in air traffic control towers. Ordinarily, personnel issues account for roughly 5% of such delays, according to aviation data.",
      "\"Draconian steps\"?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the\u00a09/11 terror attacks for national security reasons, while hurricanes and other weather emergencies can also lead to flight restrictions. But closing parts of the nation's airspace because of staffing issues would be unprecedented, according to aviation industry experts.",
      "\"In this particular instance, Duffy is talking about staffing. He knows the strain and stress this is taking on air traffic controllers,\" Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an expert on aviation security, told CBS News.",
      "Closing even a portion of the nation's vast airspace would be a major step and likely impact travel nationwide, he added. The system operates on a so-called hub-and-spoke model in which passengers using regional airports can connect with major airports to travel around the U.S.",
      "If the airspace around New York were to close, for example, it could affect passengers in multiple cities, according to Jacobson.",
      "\"For us to take such draconian steps to shut it down in sectors of the country would be unprecedented,\" he said. \"If you shut down the New York area, you shut down a lot of the country because of the interconnectivity of the hub-and-spoke system.\"",
      "More controllers calling in sick",
      "With air traffic controllers working without pay during the shutdown, more than usual are calling in sick, Duffy has said. He has said he is discouraging them from taking on side gigs like delivering for Uber or DoorDash to make ends meet during the funding lapse, given the level of focus that their job requires.",
      "\"The longer this goes on, every day, these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, and they're being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said Tuesday. \"As every day goes by, I think the problem is going to only get worse. Not better.\"",
      "At an Oct. 28 news conference at LaGuardia Airport in New York, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels emphasized that his organization's members are under mounting financial pressures.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association on Monday urged congressional leaders to end the shutdown, which the industry trade group said could disrupt passengers during the busy Thanksgiving holiday. In 2024, 20 million passengers took to the skies over that week.",
      "\"A shutdown places extraordinary strain on federal personnel who are essential to keeping America moving \u2014 from Transportation Security Administration officers to air traffic controllers, who are forced to work without pay,\" the group said in a Nov. 3 letter. \"When staffing shortages worsen, airport wait times grow longer and flight delays and cancellations become more frequent, threatening to derail family travel plans across the country.\"",

Yet the move still leaves participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the dark on exactly when they will get the funds.",
      "In a\u00a0declaration\u00a0submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said $4.6 billion in contingency USDA funds will be used to cover 50% of SNAP recipients' benefits.",
      "However, the USDA declaration said that procedural changes U.S. states must make in order to issue partial benefits could take \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months.\" A spokesperson for the USDA referred CBS News to a social media\u00a0post\u00a0from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, which also says benefits could take several weeks to arrive.",
      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue SNAP payments since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.",
      "\"I would hope that states will move heaven and Earth to get SNAP benefits flowing as quickly as possible,\" she said.",
      "The White House referred CBS News to the Office of Management and Budget, which also did not respond to a request for comment.",

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified at a press conference later in the day that Mr. Trump was referring to future SNAP payments.",
      "\"He does not want to have to keep tapping into an emergency fund and depleting it in the case of a catastrophe in this country,\" she said.",
      "With questions continuing to swirl around the SNAP program, attention has turned to how this uncertainty directly affects people on food stamps.

      "In May of 2024, however, a hit-and-run accident required multiple surgeries and left the 64-year-old Lennox unable to work. Without a stable source of income, Lennox said she relies on SNAP, disability and Social Security retirement benefits to pay the bills. She plans to return to work as soon as she's physically capable, saying she needs a job to help cover her medical expenses.",

      "After learning that SNAP funding was under threat because of the shutdown, Lennox said she pulled back on buying food by conserving the remaining food stamps on her electronic benefits card. She currently has $240 in food stamp payments, but plans on visiting a local food bank to make ends meet.",

      "The deal, announced\u00a0Monday, values the chain at $620 million, including debt. The investors purchasing the company are private equity investment company TriArtisan Capital Advisors, investment firm Treville Capital and Denny's franchisee Yadav Enterprises.",
      "Under the agreement, Denny's shareholders will receive $6.25 per share in cash for each share of Denny's common stock they own, or a total of $322 million. That represents a 52% premium to Denny's closing stock price on Monday.",
      "Denny's shares jumped $2.05, or 50%, to $6.17 in early Tuesday trading.",
      "Founded in 1953 as Danny's Donuts, the company changed its name to Denny's in 1959 to avoid confusion with another chain, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange a decade later. During the past two years, Denny's has struggled to boost sales as consumers shifted toward a reliance on delivery through apps like Uber Eats, while newer rivals such as First Watch offered healthier breakfast menus.",

      "\"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" said Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the country's government pension fund.",
      "The fund has a 1.16% stake in Tesla, the sixth-largest holding among institutional investors.",

      "Travelers heading to airports this week may face more flight disruptions as air traffic controllers missed their first full paycheck late last month and with the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on the cusp of becoming the longest in U.S. history.",
      "Almost 6,000 U.S. flights were delayed on Sunday, Nov. 2, according to FlightAware, a flight tracking service. Newark Liberty Airport on Sunday had a four-hour ground delay, while staffing triggers \u2014 a Federal Aviation Administration alert system to indicate an air traffic control facility is understaffed \u2014 were reported at airports including Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; Austin, Texas; and Denver, Colorado.",
      "Airport delays are \"going to get worse,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday.",
      "The shutdown on Tuesday is set to become the longest in history, when it would eclipse the 2018-2019 funding lapse. In the meantime, air traffic controllers and workers for the Transportation Security Administration \u2014 both considered essential workers \u2014 are required to show up at their jobs even though their pay is halted until lawmakers agree on a new deal to fund the federal government.",
      "The longer the shutdown stretches on, the more likely it is to cause flight delays and snarls at security checkpoints, Katy Nastro, a travel expert at Going.com, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're over a month into this shutdown, and in the last few days is really when we've started to see that the seams are ripping,\" Nastro said. \"It's not just in air traffic control staffing triggers, but we're seeing TSA lines hit the 3-4 hour mark.\"",
      "Some Houston travelers faced waits of about an hour to get through airport security lines this weekend, according to CBS affiliate KHOU. Only two out of five security checkpoints are open at Houston's Bush airport, the station noted, while the Houston Chronicle\u00a0reported\u00a0that some people faced waits of three hours to get through the airport's security.",
      "Thanksgiving outlook for air travel",
      "If the shutdown drags longer into November, the real pain point could come during Thanksgiving week, when a record number of Americans are expected to travel for the holidays, Nastro said.",
      "\"I would be cautious if this continues into Thanksgiving \u2014 we're likely to see multiple days of 3 million-plus travelers,\" she said. \"At that point, we would be coming into almost two months of a shutdown.\"",
      "Some holiday travelers might be better off driving to their destinations given the potential for flight disruptions, Nastro added. Booking early morning flights, such as those that depart between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m., can also help minimize delays because these departures are more likely to be on time than flights that are scheduled later in the day, travel data shows.",
      "Still, experts said that air safety isn't an issue, given that the FAA will slow flights if there aren't enough air traffic controllers directing flights. That was reiterated by Duffy on Sunday, who told \"Face the Nation\" that the federal government will \"stop traffic\" if it becomes a safety issue.",
      "\"We're not going to let that happen,\" Duffy added.",

      "The Affordable Care Act marketplaces opened for enrollment on Nov. 1, with the average premium for a mid-level insurance plan surging 26% this year to $625 per month, according to nonprofit health research firm KFF.",
      "That jump \u2014 the biggest increase in ACA plan rates since 2018 \u2014 is causing sticker shock for some people who rely on the program for health insurance coverage.",
      "\"I've been hearing stories about the price increases, so I've been dreading this week,\" Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas, told CBS News. When he logged into his state's marketplace, he was dismayed to find out that his current plan's monthly premium is set to rise to $2,600 a month next year, up from $2,200 a month in 2025.",
      "That doesn't include higher cost-sharing for his family, such as a larger out-of-pocket maximum for 2026, meaning he's facing higher costs on both ends for the same coverage for himself, his wife and their 11-year-old son.",
      "\"I already pay a significant portion of my income for this insurance,\" he noted. \"What the hell am I paying for at this point?\"",
      "Roughly 24 million Americans get their health insurance through an ACA plan.",
      "The 26% premium hike for so-called ACA silver plans reflects what insurers are charging consumers buying plans via the marketplaces. Millions of Americans currently pay below the ACA's market rates because of\u00a0premium tax credits, KFF said. Those credits are set to expire at the end of 2025 \u2014 a looming deadline that has contributed to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, as Democratic lawmakers push for Republicans to agree to an extension.",
      "The roughly 22 million people who currently rely on the premium tax credits could see their ACA plan costs more than double in 2026, KFF estimates.",
      "Even those who don't qualify for the credits, as in Tolbert's case, face sharply higher health insurance costs next year, KFF said. The main factors behind that increase are increased demand for costly treatments, such as\u00a0GLP-1 drugs\u00a0for weight loss; higher prices from hospitals and other providers; and insurer projections that millions of people could drop their coverage next year when the premium tax credits expire, said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of KFF's program on the ACA.",
      "\"The biggest factor is that health care costs for everybody are going up,\" Cox told CBS News. \"That's driven by the underlying health care costs, hospital costs, doctor visits and drugs.\"",
      "\"The last time we saw premium increases like this was 2017, going into 2018, when we were talking about ACA 'repeal and replace,'\" a period during President Trump's first term when he\u00a0sought to roll back the Affordable Care Act, she added.",
      "Higher ACA insurance costs could spur some people to go without coverage, said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and a former official at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Biden administration.",
      "\"Some will have to go to skimpier plans,\" she noted in a recent conference call organized by left-leaning economic advocacy group Groundwork Collaborative to discuss the ACA premium tax credit expiration. \"Deductibles are going up as well ... [consumers] will be heading into next year with bigger out-of-pocket expenses.\"",
      "For some people, going without health coverage might seem like a financial necessity in the face of sharply higher ACA plan costs in 2026, but ultimately could prove ruinous, KFF's Cox said. \"It's like gambling with your health and your wallet,\" she added. \"You don't know what will happen.\"",
      "In the meantime, Tolbert expressed concern that ACA insurance may become unaffordable for his family if premiums continue to increase at the same pace. That could push him or his wife, who currently stays at home with their son, to look for a job with a bigger employer to secure health insurance, he noted.",
      "\"At this rate, I have one to three more years before I can no longer afford a plan,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture told a federal court that it will tap into a contingency fund to allow states to issue partial November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program during the government shutdown.",
      "In a declaration submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\"",
      "There is roughly $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover November benefit payments, according to Penn. Officials have said fully covering those benefits would require roughly $9 billion. The $4.6 billion will be used to \"cover 50% of eligible households' current allotments,\" Penn said.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to buy food, and the program ran out of funding over the weekend due to the ongoing shutdown. The federal government funds SNAP by sending money to the states, which oversee food stamp programs for their residents.",
      "Justice Department lawyers separately told the court that the administration will \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds\" by providing states with information on Monday that they can use to calculate benefits due to each eligible household.",
      "The administration said it will \"have made the necessary funds available and have authorized the states to begin disbursements\" once the material has been issued.",
      "Still, relief to food-aid recipients may not be immediate. Penn wrote in his declaration that there could be \"payment errors and significant delays\" because of variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "\"For at least some States, USDA's understanding is that the system changes States must implement to provide the reduced benefit amounts will take anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months,\" he said.",
      "Democracy Forward, a legal advocacy group that is representing a group of municipalities and nonprofit organizations that sued the Trump administration, said in a statement it is \"considering all legal options to secure payment of full funds.\"",
      "\"It shouldn't take a court order to force our president to provide essential nutrition that Congress has made clear needs to be provided. But since that is what it takes, we will continue to use the courts to protect the rights of people,\" Skye Perryman, the group's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, pushed the administration to transfer money from other programs to fully fund November benefits, saying the courts \"have made it clear\" that the government has the authority to do so.",
      "\"It is not enough to do the bare minimum \u2014 the administration should stop playing politics with hunger and use all available resources to ensure Americans can put food on the table,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.",
      "The USDA filing came in response to an order issued by Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case brought by nonprofits and municipalities in Rhode Island. Last Friday, McConnell ordered the Trump administration to tap into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP funding caused by the shutdown. The judge gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the funds.",
      "In a separate case in Massachusetts, two dozen states and the District of Columbia filed suit to get the administration to use the contingency funds. The judge in that case agreed with their argument that the government is required to use the money and likewise asked for an update by Monday.",
      "The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress had argued that the contingency fund couldn't legally be used to pay SNAP benefits because the underlying appropriation for the program had lapsed. Both judges disagreed with that argument and said the fund must be used to cover part of the shortfall.",
      "\"There is no question that the congressionally approved contingency funds must be used now because of the shutdown,\" McConnell wrote in the written version of his order on Saturday.",
      "He also said the government should \"find the additional funds necessary (beyond the contingency funds) to fully fund the November SNAP payments.\" The $5 billion in the contingency fund does not fully cover the $9 billion needed to pay out benefits for the month, and the administration had argued that calculating partial payments would be \"exceedingly difficult, highly disruptive, and delayed.\"",
      "The judge said the government could choose to issue partial payments instead of finding other sources of funding, but added that \"under no circumstances\" could those payments be delayed beyond Wednesday.",
      "The USDA warned late last month that federal food benefits would not go out to roughly 42 million recipients on Nov. 1 after it declined to tap into contingency funds to keep food stamp payments flowing during the shutdown. The agency pinned the blame for the pause on congressional Democrats for failing to back a GOP-backed stopgap measure that would fund federal agencies.",
      "The shutdown entered its 34th day Monday and is poised to become the longest shutdown in U.S. history if lawmakers fail to reach agreement on a spending measure by late Tuesday.",
      "The initial decision to halt the food aid appeared to be a shift from the USDA's plan for a lapse in federal funding that was issued Sept. 30. The agency said in its plan that multi-year contingency funds could be used for state administrative expenses to ensure states could continue SNAP operations during a shutdown and were also available \"to fund participant benefits\" in the event of a funding lapse.",
      "But the USDA wrote in a memo to states late last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to over regular benefits,\" and said the money was meant for priorities like assisting people in disaster areas.",
      "Faced with the looming cutoff of food stamp payments, half the states and the District of Columbia, as well as the municipalities, sought relief from the federal courts. Some states said they would work to continue providing assistance to food-aid beneficiaries. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans receive food stamps.",

      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"1929\" by Andrew Ross Sorkin",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Charles Mitchell strode up the steps of 55 Wall Street, determined to project his usual sense of confidence and certitude. It had been a crushing afternoon. As he returned to his office, he knew that the eyes of Wall Street were on him \u2014 everyone from the traders in the street to his own secretary was assessing his gait and searching his face, trying to read meaning into every twitch, every line, every wrinkle.",
      "In his gray three\u2011piece suit, shoulders back, Mitchell kept up his smile as he passed through the glass\u2011domed central hall of his National City Bank. With its eighty\u2011three\u2011foot ceiling and two solid bronze doors protecting a safe weighing some three hundred tons, the bank was the largest in the country.",
      "It was just past 5:30 p.m. on Monday, October 28, 1929. Hours earlier, the stock market had closed with a sharp, dizzying drop of 13 percent after a week of downward convulsions; today was by far the greatest fall. The darkening downtown streets still teemed with anxious brokers in their fedoras and flat caps, messenger boys and switchboard girls, all gossiping and speculating about the collapse. What caused the fall? How much further might it go tomorrow? Would the markets even open?",
      "As Mitchell made his way to his office, the teller windows he passed reflected the weary puffiness under his eyes and his disheveled, graying eyebrows. He collapsed into the chair behind his mahogany desk. The room was furnished with the high formality befitting an eighteenth\u2011century statesman: antique wood chairs, a grandfather clock that stood against the cream\u2011white woodwork flanked by portraits of George Washington orchestrating the newly independent nation with the purpose and resolve that Mitchell sought to emulate in his own life.",
      "The athletic fifty\u2011two\u2011year\u2011old bank chairman \u2014 an unusually optimistic man whom the press called \"Sunshine Charlie\" \u2014 had spent the afternoon in emergency meetings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, puzzling over how to calm the market. It was a moment for which a self\u2011consciously Great Man like Mitchell should have been utterly prepared. He had the experience, the stature, and the steely nerves necessary to steer Wall Street through these tough times.",
      "Yet he felt exposed, vulnerable.",
      "But he didn't have time to consider his emotional state.",
      "He walked upstairs to confer with Hugh Baker, who ran National City's stock\u2011trading unit.",
      "Baker, a tall, bald man with piercing eyes, began to explain to Mitchell, calmly, if somewhat obliquely, what had taken place while Mitchell had been at the Federal Reserve.",
      "\"Our portfolio today has been tremendously increased in our holdings of National City Bank stock,\" Baker told him.",
      "Mitchell stared at him, waiting to hear exactly what he meant.",
      "Baker finally blurted out: \"We purchased seventy\u2011odd thousand shares.\"",
      "Mitchell, who could calculate numbers instantly in his head, immediately grasped the nature and scale of the problem. That is unbelievable, he thought. The bank didn't have the cash to pay for so many shares. He was outraged \u2014 and terrified. Everything he had built was suddenly at grave risk of collapse.",
      "Barely a month earlier, Mitchell had been on top of the world. He had finalized an agreement to take over the Corn Exchange Bank, a bold acquisition that would turn National City from the largest bank in the country into the largest in the world, stealing the mantle from London and helping New York finally eclipse its rival city as the world financial center. This was history in the making, an overthrow of the established order, the kind of gambit that made Mitchell a king among men.",
      "But to pull off the deal, Mitchell had made a big \u2014 and risky \u2014 bet on the strength of his own stock. Corn Exchange shareholders could take $360 in cash for each of their shares, or four fifths of a share in National City Bank. On paper, the stock was the better deal: As long as National City stock stayed above $450, four fifths of a share was worth more than $360 in cash. At the time the deal was struck, it was comfortably higher, trading at $496 a share. Mitchell needed it to stay there until the deal could be completed, likely in the next month \u2014 because, in truth, National City didn't have the cash to pay everyone, a crucial detail he kept to himself.",
      "So he quietly instructed his traders to buy the bank's shares whenever the price slipped.",
      "In a relatively stable market, this posed no problem. Big publicly traded companies bought back their own shares all the time. In a rapidly falling market, however, doing so could quickly become like shoveling money into a furnace, which was what had been happening that afternoon. In the chaos of all that selling pressure, National City's bids had been accepted so quickly that they lost track of how many they had amassed. By the time traders got a handle on the situation, National City had committed to buy seventy\u2011one thousand of its own shares, far more than it could afford to hold.",
      "\"With that news,\" he told Baker, \"I could be knocked over with a feather.\"",
      "There were very few good options. To fund their daily operations, big banks like National City had to constantly borrow against their assets. But banking law prevented them from offering their own stock as collateral. Thus, those seventy\u2011one thousand shares \u2014 which cost about $32 million \u2014 were a deadweight that could possibly take down the whole bank.",
      "\"It would be embarrassing for us to attempt to borrow on that stock in other banks,\" Mitchell said, knowing full well that his rivals would seize on any such move as a sign of vulnerability. With the market in free fall, short sellers \u2014 traders who bet that stocks would go down \u2014 were lining up targets, probing for weakness.",
      "The stock market was at the breaking point. Sales volume had overwhelmed the human apparatus of the trading floor to such an extent that, on the previous Thursday, the ticker had fallen four hours behind in reporting stock prices, more than twice the longest previous delay.",
      "What this meant was that the big board of prices that loomed over the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was hopelessly inaccurate. Trading stocks in this environment was like being a gambler at a baseball game in the eighth inning and looking at a scoreboard that hadn't been updated since the third, while everybody around you was shouting conflicting opinions about which team was ahead and by how much. The prices of stocks sold privately \u2014 known as \"off\u2011exchange,\" which was the case with National City shares \u2014 were even further behind because they were tied to the broader market's movements without being fully updated in real time, exacerbating the delay. For Wall Street traders, the only prudent decision was to sell and get the hell out of the market. Which is exactly what they were doing.",
      "Mitchell knew that if he tried to unload even a small fraction of National City's position back into such a weak market, rumors would begin to fly about the bank's solvency, and that could easily turn into a vicious cycle that would be impossible to stop.

      "Selling for nearly $1,000 a cup, a cafe in Dubai is offering the world's most expensive coffee, brewed from Panamanian beans sold at a premium price.",
      "The wealthy emirate is known for its extravagant ventures, including an enormous mall with an indoor ski area, the world's tallest building and an artificial island dotted with five-star hotels.",
      "\"The wait is finally over,\" Serkan Sagsoz, co-founder of the Julith cafe with the pricey offering,\u00a0said in a Facebook video. \"The world's most celebrated and highest graded coffee of all time has arrived at Julith.\"",
      "Located in an industrial neighborhood that has become a hotspot for coffee lovers, Julith plans to serve \"around 400 cups\" of the precious beverage starting on Saturday, Sagsoz told AFP.",
      "\"We felt Dubai was the perfect place for our investment,\" Sagsoz said.",
      "For a price tag of 3,600 dirhams (around $980), the brew offers an experience of floral and fruity flavors reminiscent of tea.",
      "\"There are white floral notes like jasmine, citrus flavors like orange and bergamot and a hint of apricot and peach,\" said Sagsoz, who previously ran a cafe in his native Turkey.",
      "\"It's like honey, delicate and sweet,\" he said.",
      "Dubai notched a Guinness World Record for the world's most expensive cup of coffee last month, when Roasters offered one for 2,500 dirhams.",
      "The new record staggered some people, though residents also said it was par for the course for the desert city with a luxury lifestyle.",

      "It claimed to have paid the highest price ever for coffee.",
      "Twenty kilograms of the beans went for around 2.2 million dirhams, or $600,000, Julith said in a press release.",
      "Asian buyers, Emirati coffee enthusiasts and coffee bean collectors have since reached out to the cafe in the hopes of securing some of the \"Nido 7 Geisha\" beans, which are grown on a plantation near Panama's Baru volcano.",

      "Coffee prices surging in U.S.",
      "The pricey cup of coffee is being offered as the cost of roasted coffee has jumped 18.9% in the U.S., according to the most recent Consumer Price Index data for September.",
      "The average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee reached a record high of $9.14 per pound in September, labor\u00a0data\u00a0shows. That's well over double the price from December 2019, when a pound of ground coffee cost just over $4.",
      "Several factors are driving this increase. First, volatile weather, including both heavy rain and droughts in major coffee-producing countries, such as Brazil and Colombia, is depressing crop yields, Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru, told CBS News.",
      "Lempert also said American tariffs on foreign imports are having an impact on domestic coffee prices. As of 2023, the U.S. imported about 80% its unroasted beans from Latin America,\u00a0according\u00a0to the USDA, with Hawaii and Puerto Rico the only U.S. states or territories that produce much coffee.",
      "The Trump administration this year has imposed new tariffs on several major coffee producers that export to the U.S. That includes a 50% levy on Brazil, which has led producers there to withhold shipments as they negotiate with American roasters over who will absorb the added costs, according to investment bank UBS.",
      "In a September\u00a0report, the International Coffee Organization cited uncertainty around coffee tariffs as one catalyst impacting supply in the U.S. Coffee \"cannot be produced in the U.S. on a large enough scale to meet domestic demand,\" the trade group noted.",

    "summary": "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" said one mother of two about a looming freeze in food aid.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards. On Nov. 1, that aid is set to abruptly stop amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, potentially leaving households scrambling to figure out how to put food on the table.",
      "People enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, told CBS News they're bracing for some tough financial choices. Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mother living in Buckfield, Maine, said she's planning to delay paying her electric and credit card bills to make sure her two children have enough to eat.",
      "\"Now we'll have to prioritize which bills we can pay and which can wait,\" McBlais, who works for a Maine social services agency and who draws about $600 a month in SNAP benefits, said. \"My children won't go hungry.\"",
      "The suspension of food aid comes as Democratic and Republican lawmakers continue to trade blame over the\u00a0government shutdown, which now stands as the second-longest funding lapse in U.S. history. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds the SNAP program, warned earlier this month that there would be insufficient funding to pay full November benefits if the shutdown continued, prompting local governments to post notices on their websites about the potential interruption in payments.",
      "\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA said in a memo\u00a0posted Sunday on its website. \"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.\"",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Saturday isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have asked the USDA to use contingency funds to cover most of next month's SNAP benefits, but an agency memo surfaced on Friday that says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits.\" The document says the money is reserved for such things as helping people in disaster areas.",
      "That means beginning Nov. 1, the government will halt about $8 billion in monthly SNAP payments, cutting off food assistance for the one in eight Americans who are enrolled in the program. Recipients, who include households in every state, typically get about $187 a month on a prepaid card to help cover the cost of groceries.",
      "Unused benefits on SNAP recipients' cards will roll over into November.",
      "\"That's money that's already been appropriated. It's been put on their card,\" Mackenzie Libbey, a staff attorney with Community Legal Services, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"So we definitely do not want people rushing out to try to use up their benefits at the end of October thinking they're not going to be able to buy anything in November.\"",
      "The USDA said it is incumbent on Democrats in Congress to end the government shutdown.",
      "\"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely\" SNAP benefits and other federal food aid, the agency said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Some U.S. states, including Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia, have vowed to continue disbursing SNAP benefits even if the federal government suspends payments. New York on Monday\u00a0pledged $30 million in emergency food assistance, while also recently committing to provide millions more in support for food banks. The USDA memo stipulates that states won't be reimbursed for temporarily providing food aid to residents, raising questions about the viability of that approach.",
      "Other states are taking legal action.",
      "A coalition of 25 states and the District of Columbia on Tuesday\u00a0sued the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of food stamps is unlawful and threatens the health and well-being of millions. The states are asking a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the USDA to provide SNAP benefits in November by tapping into a contingency fund, which is estimated to hold around $5 billion.",
      "\"Where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sharlene Sutton, a 45-year-old single mother of four in Dorchester, Massachusetts, who left her job as a security officer last month to care for one of her children, who has epilepsy, said she relies on the $549 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to feed her family.",
      "\"I was freaking out because I'm like, 'Oh my god, now I don't have a job,'\" she told CBS News. \"I'm not worried about myself that much. It's about the kids. Like, where am I going to get food from?\"",
      "Sutton said she's looking for a food bank to help fill the gap if her food aid is cut off. But experts warn that the non-profit organizations alone aren't capable of filling the $8 billion monthly hole left by a looming SNAP suspension.",
      "\"The charitable food system and food banks don't have the resources to replace all those food dollars,\" John Sayles, CEO of Vermont Foodbank in Barre, Vermont, told CBS News.",
      "Already, food banks are getting an influx of calls from SNAP recipients who are worried about the payment freeze, and food shelves could see long lines next month if the shutdown persists, Sayles said.",
      "\"There is no safety net after SNAP other than the food shelf,\" he added.",
      "Albuquerque, New Mexico's Roadrunner Food Bank, which typically serves 83,000 households per week, is \"seeing panic\" among residents due to the SNAP halt, said Katy Anderson, vice president of strategy, partnerships and advocacy at the nonprofit organization.",
      "George Matysik, executive director of the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, has also noticed an uptick in demand. He told CBS News in a text message that some of the pantries the hunger relief nonprofit works with have reported 12-fold increases in new registrations week to week.",
      "Even before this new surge in demand, food banks were already facing pressures because of the growing number of people seeking their services, aggravated this year by\u00a0persistent inflation\u00a0and funding constraints. In March, the\u00a0USDA said it was nixing $420 million in funding\u00a0for a program that allows food banks to buy food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "Broader economic impact",
      "A temporary halt in $8 billion in monthly food aid could also impact local businesses, from grocers to farm stands, said Sayles of Vermont Foodbank. Each $1 in SNAP benefits provides an economic benefit of $1.60, he said, referring to the so-called\u00a0multiplier effect\u00a0in which dollars flowing through the local economy help support spending, jobs and growth.",
      "\"SNAP is the foundation of economic support for a lot of food retailers, like those smaller places in rural areas and the corner store in our cities,\" said Kate Bauer, an associate professor of nutritional services at the University of Michigan. \"So this has far-reaching impacts beyond just the people who get SNAP.\"",
      "SNAP is designed to provide supplemental aid for a family's grocery budget, but some families depend on it as their main source of income to buy food, Bauer noted. For those living paycheck to paycheck, even a short disruption in benefits can have immediate consequences, experts said.",
      "The loss of SNAP funding threatens some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S., with the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities noting that two-thirds of food-stamp recipients are children, seniors or people with disabilities.",
      "For McBlais, the single mom, the issue isn't political. Rather, it's about making sure families can eat in an economy where many are already struggling to afford rent, utilities and basic groceries, she told CBS News.",
      "\"Everybody needs food \u2014 SNAP recipients are Democratic, Republicans and everything in between,\" McBlais said.",

      "SNAP recipients receive an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card, and many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. Many of those registered with the program are asking if they will still be able to use the remaining dollars on their cards once funding is suspended and if they'll receive their November benefits retroactively, should lawmakers reach a deal to reopen the government.",
      "A stoppage in SNAP payments on Nov. 1 isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday, Oct. 31, that the Trump administration is required by law to\u00a0use contingency funds\u00a0to pay at least partial SNAP benefits.",
      "The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "With just days to go before a potential suspension in SNAP funding, here's what to know.",
      "Will current SNAP benefits roll over to November?",
      "While SNAP benefits will not be disbursed as scheduled in November, program recipients can use existing funds on their EBT cards to make purchases. If someone enrolled in the program hasn't spent all their October EBT dollars, for example, those benefits would roll over into November.",
      "Some states are advising recipients to use their remaining food stamps wisely, given the stalemate over funding the federal government.",

      "\"It is our understanding that SNAP benefits will be issued retroactively when the shutdown ends,\" said Lizbeth Ginsburg, a managing attorney in the welfare law unit at Greater Boston Legal Services.",
      "Federal rules\u00a0governing the food-stamp program stipulate that SNAP recipients are entitled to their benefits, and that they should receive them if there's a disruption, said Gina Plata-Nino, interim SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger.",
      "\"That's why many state agencies have done a very good job of saying, 'Your benefits will be delayed,' versus, 'You are not getting benefits,'\" she told CBS News.",
      "Can states step in to fund SNAP?",
      "While SNAP is federally funded and overseen by the USDA, each state is responsible for administering the program to its residents.",
      "Some states are taking action, with Democratic lawmakers\u00a0urging\u00a0Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to tap into an estimated $5 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits next month. On Tuesday, a coalition of officials from 25 states and the District of Columbia\u00a0sued the Trump administration\u00a0over the suspension of benefits, arguing that it is unlawful. The\u00a0lawsuit\u00a0notes that this would mark the first delay in SNAP benefits in the program's history.",
      "In recent days, several states have pledged to step in to ensure SNAP recipients can afford food in November. Their approaches vary, with some states promising to dispatch troops to support food banks, while others are allocating funds for general hunger relief.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry\u00a0signed an emergency declaration on Oct. 24 intended to fund SNAP benefits for people who rely on the program, while Vermont lawmakers on Oct. 29 approved a plan to cover its residents' food stamp benefits through Nov. 15.",

      "Millions of Americans are sliding toward a financial cliff as the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0stretches into a second month, with four federal assistance programs for low-income families set to run out of funding on Nov. 1.",
      "Some families could lose access to multiple sources of government support. Ashley Trent, a 37-year-old single mother of six, expressed concern she could soon be without aid provided under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), better known as food stamps, and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program, which provides food aid for mothers of young children.",
      "\"I'm wondering how I'm going to be able to afford everything,\" Trent, a Bloomington, Ill., resident who works full-time as a housing navigator, told CBS News. \"It's very stressful \u2014 what bills will I have to put off? I have a car note, I have insurance, I have clothes I have to get my kids because it's getting colder.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which funds SNAP and WIC, has said it will halt payments for the anti-hunger programs on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. Head Start programs serving 65,000 low-income children will also lose federal funding on Saturday, potentially disrupting preschool for thousands of families,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Head Start Association.",
      "The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps struggling households heat their homes, could be next to run short of funding.",
      "Halting funding for these programs \u2014 which help cover food, education, and energy costs \u2014 could have lasting consequences for poor families already strained by high grocery and utility prices, said Ailen Arreaza, executive director of the advocacy group ParentsTogether Action.",
      "Although funding will resume once Congress passes legislation to reopen the government, she warned that the damage to households could persist.",
      "\"What we are hearing from parents is desperation \u2014 parents going without meals, making impossible decisions about not paying bills or going without medication,\" Arreaza told CBS News. \"This has so many implications, because these kids need these programs to get ahead.\"",
      "Experts note that hunger can hinder children's ability to learn, while parents who fall behind on bills may face utility shutoffs or other lasting setbacks.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The USDA is set to\u00a0halt SNAP payments on Nov. 1, leaving about 42 million Americans uncertain how they'll afford groceries next month. Recipients receive an average of about $187 a month on prepaid cards that can be used to buy food at grocery stores, farmers' markets and other retailers.",
      "A prolonged cessation in food-stamp funding isn't guaranteed. Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration is required by law to use contingency funds to pay at least partial SNAP benefits. The government must respond by Monday on whether it plans to allocate money to continue payments.",
      "Meanwhile, more than a dozen states are trying to fill the gap by using state funds to support food aid or local food banks. But food bank leaders say charities can't make up for a cutoff in food stamps.",
      "\"It's going to hurt us really bad,\" said Taylour Grant, 29, a Tampa medical assistant who relies on $970 a month in SNAP benefits to feed her four children, plus WIC support for her youngest, who is 1-year-old. \"It's really scary because I know I'll go without to make sure my kids are fed.\"",
      "Grant said many people misunderstand who relies on SNAP. \"We're not on it because we want to be \u2014 no one makes enough to live off these days. That help is really needed,\" she said.",
      "WIC",
      "Nearly 7 million low-income pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5 who receive WIC could lose federal aid in November because of the government shutdown.",
      "Unlike food stamps, WIC provides funds specifically to purchase formula and nutritious foods for pregnant women and young children, though many families rely on both programs, said Georgia Machell, CEO of the National WIC Association.",
      "\"None of these programs operate in a vacuum,\" she said. \"Often, if a family is participating in WIC, they're also participating in SNAP.\"",
      "WIC continued paying benefits in October after the Trump administration tapped\u00a0$300 million\u00a0in leftover tariff revenue from the previous fiscal year. But with the stalemate in Congress continuing into November, that funding could run out.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about whether it could tap additional tariff revenue to fund the program. At this point, the program is set to delay payments on Nov. 1, according to the National WIC Association.",
      "WIC has been able to maintain funding during previous shutdowns in its 50-year history, according to the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on stopping hunger. \"The disruptions we're concerned about would be fairly historic,\" Machell said.",
      "Some states have pledged to use their own funds to keep WIC running, but many lack the budget, according to FRAC.",
      "Head Start",
      "About 140 Head Start programs in 41 states and Puerto Rico will lose federal funding with the shutdown set to extend past Nov. 1, affecting roughly 65,000 children, according to the National Head Start Association. Nationwide, about 750,000 children are enrolled in Head Start.",
      "Some programs may not be able to stay open, regional program directors warn.",
      "\"Everybody is trying to do everything they can to keep children in classrooms and families at work,\" Michelle Haimowitz, executive director of the Massachusetts Head Start Association,\u00a0told CBS News Boston. \"But it is incredibly difficult to operate without those federal funds.\"",
      "Minnesota mother Jaycee Chrudimsky said she fears that the closure of her local Head Start program could force her to miss work and affect her 4-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It would impact her, and that's the thing I worry about the most, because she looks forward to coming to school every single day and seeing her friends and being a part of the program,\" Chrudimsky\u00a0told\u00a0CBS News Minnesota this week.",
      "LIHEAP",
      "Another program threatened by the shutdown is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The program helps about 6 million low-income households pay their energy bills.",
      "\"We are now at a point where the government shutdown is going to cause serious delays in the release of LIHEAP funds,\" Wolfe told CBS News.",
      "The delay could leave millions of families behind on utility bills and facing power shutoffs just as\u00a0energy prices are skyrocketing, he added.",
      "NEADA projects the\u00a0average cost for people to heat a home this winter\u00a0will rise nearly 8%.",
      "\"It's a perfect storm of misery for low- and middle-income households,\" Wolfe said.",

    "summary": "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol doesn't expect AI to replace baristas as the coffee chain focuses on improving the \"human-to-human experience\" for customers.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol took the helm in September 2024, inheriting a company facing its first revenue decline in four years amid customer complaints about high prices and long wait times. A year later, the coffee giant has halted the slide but faces fresh pressures, from surging coffee bean costs to store closures.",
      "Coffee prices\u00a0jumped 30% from January through September, squeezing Starbucks' profit margins even as Niccol vowed not to raise menu costs this year. The restaurant chain said last month it would spend $1 billion to close underperforming stores and cut 900 jobs.",
      "As Niccol told CBS News' Jo Ling Kent, the retail chain can't rule out price hikes in 2026 due to rising coffee prices, although he described this step as a \"last resort.\" At the same time, Niccol noted that Starbucks has no plans to introduce a value menu like McDonald's and other fast-food chains appealing to budget-conscious patrons.",
      "\"We have a huge point of difference and that is, I think, that customer connection and the experience you get in our stores,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"I just believe, at the end of the day, the experience sets us apart from everybody else.\"",
      "He added, \"Pricing would be one of those things that we do as a last resort, and we do it very surgically. To say never, you know, I don't think you can do that in this environment.\"",
      "\"Human-to-human\"",
      "Starbucks' reboot involves what the company calls its \"Green Apron service model,\" which aims to hire more baristas, improve customer service and cut down on customer wait times.",
      "\"What we're doing right now is making sure that we're staffed correctly,\" Niccol said. \"The teams are trained correctly for the demand that we know we have in the morning, and we know that we're growing in the afternoon.\"",
      "While other companies are turning to artificial intelligence to replace some workers, Niccol said he doesn't envision AI supplanting baristas. He said the technology could be useful for behind-the-scenes tasks, such as managing the company's supply chain.",
      "\"I don't see [AI] replacing our baristas \u2014 that human-to-human experience is just too important,\" Niccol said. \"And I think it really separates our experience from everybody else.\"",
      "While Starbucks is bolstering its barista ranks, it also faces the threat of strikes from Starbucks Workers United, which represents 9,500 workers in some 550 Starbucks cafes across the country. Overall, the company has roughly 201,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Niccol said he's open to talking with union members, but also described his company's pay and benefits as generous, adding that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" Niccol told CBS News. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",
      "Although other companies have noted a pullback from low- or middle-income consumers as inflation continues to tick upwards, Niccols said Starbucks patrons are still opening their wallets.",
      "\"Transactions are up, our sales are up,\" Niccol said. \"What we hear from them is they love the experience and they think it's a great value proposition, so I think they're being much more judicious in where they want to spend their money.\"",
      "He added, \"And I think it's really important that you give them a great experience so that it justifies why they chose to spend money with you.\"",

      "Powder supplements sold at Sam's Club stores are linked to at least 11 cases of Salmonella in seven states, federal health authorities said Friday.",
      "Member's Mark Super Greens Powder Supplements, which were sold at the discount chain's stores nationwide and online, have been pulled from store shelves because they contain moringa leaf powder that may be contaminated with Salmonella bacteria, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in an alert posted on its website.",
      "\"If you have any of the products listed below in your home, throw them out or return them to the store,\" the agency said, while noting that the product has not been recalled.",
      "Three of the people who contracted Salmonella were hospitalized, according to the agency. Illnesses, which were reported between May and September, were confirmed in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, South Carolina and Virginia.",
      "The source of the Salmonella was traced to a single lot of organic moringa leaf powder imported from Vallon Farm Direct in Jodhpur, India, according to an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration. State health officials in Virginia and Michigan collected and tested samples of the product from the homes of people who fell ill.",
      "The CDC said it may add other Vallon Farm products with moringa leaf powder to avoid as the agency's investigation continues.",
      "Moringa is a plant native to India and other countries prized for essential nutrients including protein, amino acids, vitamins and minerals, according to research published by the National Institutes of Health. Its leaves can be dried and powdered.",
      "People infected with the Salmonella bacteria can experience symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and fever. Rarely, Salmonella can result in more serious ailments, including arterial infections, endocarditis, arthritis, muscle pain, eye irritation and urinary tract symptoms.",
      "Infections can be severe in young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, who may require hospitalization.",

      "Thousands of Starbucks workers are gearing up to vote on whether to go on strike next week.",
      "The strike authorization vote is set to begin Friday and will remain open for several days, with Starbucks Workers United expected to share results after voting ends. Employees represented by the union have staged two national strikes over the last year, most recently in May to protest Starbucks' new dress code. Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",
      "As the voting gets underway, the union is also planning a series of rallies and pickets over the weekend outside Starbucks stores in dozens of U.S. cities.",
      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500\u00a0workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in May 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

Instead, she was connected to a\u00a0scam artist\u00a0who claimed that hackers had obtained access to her bank account. The only way to protect her money was to convert the funds into bitcoin, the person told Reynolds.",
      "She withdrew her entire bank account balance, which totaled $13,100, and followed the scammer's directions to go to a bitcoin ATM at a nearby gas station. The ATM was operated by Athena Bitcoin, which has more than 4,000 such terminals across the U.S.",
      "Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb said such incidents highlight the surge in cryptocurrency scams linked to bitcoin ATM providers, resulting in the theft of millions of dollars.",
      "\"Bitcoin ATMs are a tool that scammers, that criminals, are using to separate people, including D.C. residents, from their hard-earned money,\" Schwalb told CBS News. \"Athena, as a bitcoin operator, knows that its kiosks are being used by this element, and yet [has] failed to put proper anti-fraud prevention systems in place to keep it from happening.\"",
      "He added, \"What makes it worse is they are profiting from this because they're charging very substantial fees.\"",
      "Schwalb in September filed a lawsuit against Athena, alleging that it charges \"undisclosed fees on deposits that it knows are often the result of scams, and for failing to implement adequate anti-fraud measures.\"",

      "As the Grammy and Oscar winner accepted the music award at this year's WSJ. Magazine Innovator Awards on Wednesday night, she urged the ultra-wealthy to address more of the world's issues.",
      "\"We're in a time right now where the world is really, really bad and really dark and people need empathy and help more than, kind of, ever, especially in our country,\" Eilish said to an audience that included Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, as well as \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas. \"I'd say if you have money, it would be great to use it for good things, maybe give it to some people that need it.\"",
      "Late-night host Stephen Colbert\u00a0introduced Eilish onstage at New York's Museum of Modern Art by announcing that she would donate $11.5 million of the proceeds from her Hit Me Hard and Soft tour to causes dedicated to food equity, climate justice and reducing carbon pollution.",
      "In accepting the award, the \"Bad Guy\" singer added a polite but direct call to others in the room, saying a lot of people, especially in the U.S., could use some help right now.",
      "\"Love you all, but there's a few people in here who have a lot more money than me,\" she said, to a smattering of applause. \"And if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? And no hate, but give your money away, shorties.\"",
      "Through her Changemaker Program, Eilish has worked with the nonprofit Reverb for years on its Music Decarbonization Project and its Music Climate Revolution initiative, alongside artists ranging from Dead & Company to Harry Styles.",
      "Chan was also honored at the event, receiving the \"Philanthropy of Science Innovator of the Year\" award. A spokesperson for the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Brandi Hoffine Barr, said Zuckerberg and Chan have committed to giving away 99% of their Meta shares to philanthropy over the course of their lifetimes and have already granted out $7 billion. According to Forbes, Zuckerberg's current net worth is around $224 billion.",
      "Eilish's comments come as the number of billionaires worldwide continues to grow, with 204 new billionaires added in 2024, according to a January report from\u00a0Oxfam International titled \"Takers Not Makers.\"",
      "The report found that the billionaires grew wealthier three times faster in 2024 than in 2023, pointing to an increased concentration of resources globally.",
      "Oxfam predicted that at least five people will become trillionaires in the next decade, up from one person the year before. The group called for higher taxes on the rich and other measures to break up monopolies, cap CEO pay and require companies to pay living wages.",
      "The wealthiest Americans have a long history of calling on each other to give away more of their money. In 1889, the steel magnate and industrialist Andrew Carnegie argued in the essay \"The Gospel of Wealth\" that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "In 2010,\u00a0Bill Gates,\u00a0Melinda French Gates\u00a0and\u00a0Warren Buffett\u00a0took up that call by creating the\u00a0Giving Pledge, a commitment for billionaires to give away more than half their wealth in their lifetimes or when they die.",
      "Fifteen years on, some 256 billionaires have taken the pledge, with 110 of them coming from the U.S., according to a recent\u00a0report by the Charity Reform Initiative\u00a0of the Institute for Policy Studies. Those U.S. billionaires represent 13% of the total 876 billionaires in the U.S., according to the report, revealing the small portion of the wealthiest people who have publicly committed to giving away their fortunes.",
      "The report found that of the 22 billionaires who have died since taking the pledge, only one gave away his fortune before he died. Meanwhile, only eight of the 22 deceased pledgers fulfilled the commitment by giving away half of their wealth or more at their death, though some of their estates are still being resolved.",
      "Chuck Collins, one of the authors of the report and an expert at the Institute for Policy Studies, said Eilish's comments are part of a growing realization that the rules of the economy favor those with assets over those who earn wages.",
      "He thinks the Giving Pledge has created an expectation and competition for the wealthiest to give away their money, but the fortunes of many of the pledgers have increased over time, meaning they will need to move even more aggressively if they are to fulfill the commitment.",
      "\"In the end, philanthropy is not a substitute for a fair and effective tax system,\" Collins said. \"The level of extreme inequality will require some form of restoring progressivity to the tax system, a wealth tax as well as progressive income tax.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/social-security-government-shutdown-2025-impact-benefits-checks-services/",
    "published": "Fri, 31 Oct 2025 12:24:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",
      "Benefit verificationsEarnings record corrections and updates unrelated to the adjudication of benefitsPayee accountingsPrisoner activities \u2014 suspensionRequests from third parties for queriesFreedom of Information Act requestsIT enhancement activities, public relations and trainingReplacement Medicare cardsOverpayments processing",

      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",

    "summary": "Visa predicts Americans will spend an average of $736 on holiday gifts in 2025, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to open their wallets this holiday season, increasing their gift budgets even as a slowing job market and stubborn inflation weigh on consumer confidence, according to a new analysis from Visa Business and Economic Insights.",
      "U.S. consumers are forecast to spend an average of $736 each on holiday gifts, a 10% increase from the $669 reported last year, Visa said in its 2025 holiday spending outlook.",
      "Inflation partly explains this year's projected sales growth, with the Consumer Price Index showing that prices rose 3% on an annual basis in September. But Americans are also planning on upping their gifting, especially older consumers, with baby boomers forecasted to boost their holiday spending by 21%, the study found.",
      "The robust spending outlook highlights consumers' resilience, even as confidence surveys paint a more cautious picture.",
      "\"We are clearly seeing consumers spend in a far better, more robust way than what we're seeing in the consumer sentiment and confidence data,\" Michael Brown, a principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Visa tapped retail sales data from the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 excluding automobiles, gas stations and restaurants \u2014 for its holiday spending projections.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, changes in consumer spending corresponded more closely with consumer sentiment, Visa's analysis shows. But that link has weakened in recent years. In April, for example, when consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since the pandemic, real consumer spending increased 3.1% on an annual basis, the Visa report points out.",
      "Consumers continue to express dour views about the economy, with sentiment falling for a third consecutive month\u00a0in October due to worries about a weaker job market and rising inflation, according to the latest University of Michigan sentiment index. Another measure from the Conference Board, a nonprofit group, also shows confidence in the economy edged down slightly this month.",
      "What explains the disconnect? Steady wage gains have kept spending aloft, with many Americans continuing to shop despite higher prices because their take-home pay remains solid, Brown said.",
      "Other holiday outlook forecasts from groups like Abode for Business and polling firm\u00a0Gallup point to the same conclusion as Visa's: Americans are planning to dish out billions on holiday gifts, travel and food despite their gloomy views on the economy.",
      "Still, some are exercising caution in their purchasing, Brown said, noting that low- and middle-income households will face the biggest tradeoffs this holiday season. Higher costs for essentials such as groceries are leaving them with less room for discretionary spending, he added.",
      "\"There is absolutely an undercurrent of trying to make the dollar stretch, given some of those necessities are costing a bit more this season,\" Brown said.",

      "Democrat Jay Jones will win the Virginia attorney general's race, CBS News projects, surviving a scandal that arose late in the race over violent text messages he had written in 2022 about a Republican legislator.",
      "Jones defeated GOP incumbent Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, who had tried to seize on the resurfaced text messages to portray him as unfit for the office. But Miyares, who was backed by President Trump, was confronted by the headwinds of the federal shutdown and the president's government cuts in a state with high numbers of government workers \u2014 over 147,000 \u2014 according to Office of Personnel Management data.",
      "In his sole debate against Miyares, Jones apologized multiple times for the texts, but maintained Miyares' connections to Mr. Trump were worse.",

      "In the text messages, Jones wrote that he would \"piss on graves\" of GOP opponents and mused about a fantasy hypothetical shooting of Republican Todd Gilbert, who was then speaker of the House of Delegates. In a statement to CBS News at the time, Jones said he took full responsibility for his actions and apologized for the texts.",
      "Jones had been leading the race according to a Washington Post poll in early October, but before the poll was released, the text messages resurfaced.",

As attorney general, Miyares brought lawsuits\u00a0 against the Biden administration, but has so far only joined one lawsuit against the Trump administration. Jones during the primary campaign vowed he'd sue the Trump administration \"into oblivion\" on his first day in office.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 21:40:11 -0500",
    "summary": "A Democratic Socialists of America leader says New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani offers a \"powerful way forward\" for Democrats \u2014 but some moderates worry he'll hand the GOP \"a pretty potent set of weapons\" in next year's midterms.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory on Tuesday in the New York City mayoral race is already fanning the debate about the future of the Democratic Party and what his sudden political stardom could mean for next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"We hope this is demonstrating a very powerful way forward,\" said Ashik Siddique, a national co-chair of the Democratic Socialists of America. \"This election proves that democratic socialist ideas are very popular.\"",
      "Mamdani ran on promises to confront economic inequality and cost-of-living issues, vowing rent freezes for residents of rent-stabilized units, affordable housing construction, free \u2014 and faster \u2014 bus service, free childcare, city-owned grocery stores to address high food costs and tax hikes on the wealthy.",
      "His victory is the biggest win for progressives since Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated 10-term incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley in 2018. But history suggests his success isn't likely to translate to a progressive sweep nationwide.",
      "\"It's very reminiscent of 2018 when you had this superstar, young, telegenic and extremely capable candidate win a primary in New York City and set the world on fire,\" said Matt Bennett, the executive vice president for public affairs for moderate Democratic group Third Way. \"But in the end, the thing that really mattered was that 40 seats were flipped, and Nancy Pelosi got the gavel \u2014 and those seats were flipped by moderates.\"",
      "\"Much ink will be spilled over Mamdani, and he will become a face to the party, but the idea that he will define what it means to be a Democrat, I think, is absurd,\" Bennett said.",
      "Some in the Democratic Party who have been critical of Mamdani rallied behind Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York, who ran as an independent after his defeat by Mamdani in the Democratic primary. Cuomo, the son of liberal icon and former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, was endorsed by the current scandal-ridden New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped his reelection bid, and President Trump.",
      "In the 2024 primary elections, \"mainstream\" Democrats outperformed progressive candidates, winning about two-thirds of the races, according to a study from the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The study also noted just three House candidates and one Senate candidate who identify as democratic socialists won their elections in 2024.",
      "A CBS News poll conducted last week found that just 22% of Democrats nationwide think the party should move toward socialist positions. A majority \u2014 60% of Democrats nationwide \u2014 said their party's economic positions should reflect a mixture of socialist and capitalist ideas. And 5% said the party should move more toward capitalist positions.",
      "Establishment Democratic leaders have mostly offered tepid endorsements of Mamdani, or none at all, and moderate Democrats have been trying to distance themselves from his proposals.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, was slow to endorse Mamdani, offering his backing to the candidate in late October, only a day before early voting began. Neither of the state's Democratic senators, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, gave their endorsement. Former President Barack Obama called Mamdani the weekend before the election, but he stopped short of offering public support.",
      "Jeffries told CNN in an interview Sunday that he does not view Mamdani as the future of the party and is not concerned about Republicans using him as a \"lightning rod\" against Democrats in the elections next November.",
      "That won't stop Republicans from asserting that Mamdani is the new face of the Democratic Party. They're doing it already. The National Republican Campaign Committee, the House GOP's fundraising arm, has been linking Mamdani to vulnerable Democrats in New York, as well as party leaders.",
      "\"The Democrat Party has surrendered to radical socialist Zohran Mamdani and the far-left mob who are now running the show,\" NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement Tuesday. \"Every House Democrat is foolishly complicit in their party's collapse, and voters will make them pay in 2026.\"",
      "Bennett said Mamdani's win and the Democratic Socialists of America platform gives Republicans \"a pretty potent set of weapons\" to use against Democrats running in Republican strongholds and battleground states or districts. He compared it to Republican attack ads against Democrats during the \"defund the police\" movement which gained prominence after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.",
      "\"It raises the level of difficulty to flip places from red to blue,\" Bennett said. \"What we have learned, and we especially learned from the 'defund the police' experience, is that silence is deadly. So Democrats cannot simply presume that their reputation, their brand, the fact that they are local in Wisconsin or Michigan or wherever they're running is going to be enough to convince people that they don't share the Mamdani ideas the Republicans suggest that they do.\"",
      "Also unclear: Whether New York Democrats will help or hinder Mamdani as he tries to implement his far-reaching agenda. He'll need authorization from New York state agencies for proposals like free bus service, and Democrats in Albany will need to greenlight some of the tax increases on high earners that he's proposed in order to pay for his plans.",
      "\"While there is some low-hanging fruit, we believe that many initiatives are not viable in their current form,\" J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a report on Mamdani's platform last month that argued state lawmakers are unlikely to let him hike taxes on corporations and residents who make over $1 million.",
      "Still, Bennett said there are lessons that Democratic candidates can learn from Mamdani, the most important being his \"crystal clear\" focus on affordability.",
      "\"I don't particularly like his ideas, but he articulated them in ways that really resonated and that people could kind of repeat back to him, and that's a very good lesson for Democrats to take,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist state assemblyman from Queens, will be New York City's 111th mayor.",
    "story": [
      "Zohran Mamdani will be New York City's 111th mayor, CBS News projects, capping a closely watched campaign in which the little-known state assemblyman energized voters with his focus on making America's largest city more affordable.",
      "The 34-year-old democratic socialist defeated Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent after losing a Democratic primary that he had initially entered as the clear front-runner. The mayoral race drew the attention of President Trump, who endorsed Cuomo the night before the election and threatened to withhold federal funds to New York City under a Mayor Mamdani.",
      "Mamdani's message centered around the cost of living, energizing a coalition of young and progressive voters, even as critics questioned his lack of experience and raised concerns about his stance on Israel. He pledged to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments and raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for a host of new services, like free buses and city-run grocery stores.",
      "When he assumes office, Mamdani will make history as the city's first Muslim mayor. At 34, he'll also be one of the city's youngest mayors, but not the youngest ever: That distinction belongs to Hugh J. Grant, who was 31 when he was elected to his first term in 1889.",
      "Click here for complete New York City election results.",
      "Mamdani's background",
      "Mamdani was born in Uganda and moved to New York City when he was 7. He attended the elite Bronx High School of Science before heading off to Bowdoin College.",
      "In 2018, he became an American citizen.",
      "His parents are political science professor Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair. Mamdani is married to artist Rama Duawaji. They live in Queens, where Mamdani has served as state assemblyman since 2021, representing Astoria, Astoria Heights and Ditmars-Steinway in Queens.",
      "Mamdani's policies",
      "Mamdani focused his campaign around reducing the cost of living. He promised to freeze the rent for\u00a0the city's rent-stabilized units. He has also pledged to provide\u00a0free bus service\u00a0and to open city-owned grocery stores in each borough. Mamdani also says he wants to build 200,000 affordable housing units.",
      "To pay for his proposals, Mamdani has said he would raise taxes on corporations and on top earners by 2%, but he'll need the help of Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state legislature to do it.",
      "His candidacy was enthusiastically embraced by prominent fellow progressives like\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0and\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He eventually got the endorsement of some top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Gov. Kathy Hochul.",
      "Mamdani's position on Israel\u00a0drew scrutiny over the course of the campaign. He condemned\u00a0the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attacks\u00a0on Israel, but also criticized the Israeli government's response, calling the war in Gaza a genocide. Israel said his comments were \"shameful.\"",
      "Mamdani says, while he supports Israel's right to exist,\u00a0he will not say it should exist as a Jewish state.",
      "\"I would not recognize any state's right to exist with a system of hierarchy on the basis of race or religion,\" he said in the candidates' second and final debate.",
      "He also said critics have wrongly accused him of more extreme statements.",
      "\"I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad. That is not something that I have said. And that continues to be ascribed to me. And frankly, I think much of it has to do with that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election,\" Mamdani said during the last debate.",
      "Mamdani and the NYPD",
      "Mamdani came under withering criticism for his past remarks regarding the NYPD. He previously called for disbanding the Strategic Response Group, which was the same unit that responded to the Midtown office shooting in July. He has since walked that back, saying he was opposed to using that unit to respond to protests.",
      "\"I am not defunding the police,\" Mamdani said\u00a0this summer. \"I am not running to defund the police.\"",
      "In an\u00a0October interview with Fox News, Mamdani again apologized for remarks he made about the NYPD in 2020, when he called the department \"racist\" and a \"threat to public safety\" amid nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "\"We used to ask officers to focus on serious crimes. Now we're asking them to focus also on the mental health crisis, to focus also on homelessness,\" Mamdani said last month. \"Absolutely I'll apologize to police officers right here. Because this is the apology that I've been sharing with many rank and file officers. And I apologize because of the fact that I'm looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day.\"",
      "Mamdani also recently said he would ask Jessica Tisch to stay on as police commissioner.",

    "summary": "Democrats are set to sweep Tuesday's gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, with Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger projected to win.",
    "story": [
      "Democrats are set to sweep Tuesday's gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, as the national party \u2014 still facing internal battles about its future \u2014 seeks to recover from last year's losses to President Trump.",
      "Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill is projected to defeat Republican former legislator Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey, and Democratic former Rep. Abigail Spanberger is projected to overcome Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia.",
      "The results mark a turnaround for Democrats in two states where the party has faced setbacks in recent years \u2014 especially during last year's presidential race, when Mr. Trump significantly boosted his share of the vote in normally blue-leaning New Jersey and Virginia, and the 2021 races, when Republicans reversed years of Democratic gains at the governor's mansion.",
      "The races could also serve as an early rebuke to Mr. Trump, albeit in two states that have never backed him outright. Spanberger and Sherrill ran hard against the president, who is unpopular in their respective states.",
      "And both Democratic campaigns \u2014 along with those of their GOP opponents \u2014 focused on economic concerns,\u00a0 an issue both parties have struggled with. Nationwide, most voters disapprove of the president's handling of the economy and worry that inflation will increase, though only 28% think Democrats have a better approach to economic policy than Mr. Trump and the GOP, according to a CBS News poll from last week.",
      "Still unresolved, however, is a longstanding internal dispute over whether the Democratic Party should embrace a progressive platform or move in a more moderate direction. Sherrill and Spanberger hail from the party's moderate wing. But on the same night as their victories, the New York City mayoral race is leaning toward Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who campaigned on rent freezes and city-owned grocery stores.",
      "Sherrill wins in New Jersey after Trump showed strength last year",
      "The victory by Sherrill, a four-term House member and former Navy pilot, follows two unexpectedly close races for New Jersey Democrats.",
      "One year ago, the state faced its tightest presidential contest since 1992. Mr. Trump lost the Garden State by just 5.9 percentage points in 2024, compared to 15.8-point and 14.1-point losses in prior times Mr. Trump was on the ballot.",
      "And in 2021, incumbent Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy defeated Ciattarelli by just 3 points, after Murphy won with a more than 14-point edge in 2017.",
      "While New Jersey hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988, the governor's office has darted between the two parties for decades. This year marks the first time since the 1960s when a single party has won three New Jersey gubernatorial races in a row.",
      "Both candidates spoke extensively about the cost of living, with Ciattarelli promising to \"Make New Jersey Affordable Again\" and Sherrill touting an \"Affordability Agenda.\"",
      "Sherrill frequently sought to link Ciattarelli to Mr. Trump and argued he would not stand up to the president, who enthusiastically endorsed the former state legislator, while Ciattarelli accused Democratic politicians like Murphy of mismanaging the state.",
      "Both Murphy and Mr. Trump are unpopular in New Jersey, with the governor's favorability (45%) fairly similar to the president's (44%), according to exit poll data.",
      "The race grew increasingly bitter in its closing weeks, with both campaigns tossing legal threats. CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records \u2014 including her Social Security number \u2014 to a Ciattarelli ally. And Ciattarelli threatened to sue Sherrill for defamation after she attacked him for alleged links to the opioid industry and claimed he \"went on to kill tens of thousands of people.\"",
      "Spanberger wins in Virginia after DOGE-dominated race",
      "Spanberger, a former House member and CIA officer, also tried to tie her opponent to Mr. Trump and railed against the administration's cuts to the federal workforce \u2014 a potent line of attack in Virginia, which has about 150,000 federal government jobs.",
      "Unlike in the New Jersey race, Mr. Trump did not endorse Earle-Sears for governor outright, although he appeared a telerally on Monday for the Republican ticket and he has penned Truth Social posts generically encouraging people to vote for the Republican candidates in Virginia.",
      "\"YOU WILL RUE THE DAY THAT YOU VOTED TO DESTROY YOUR LIFE,\" he wrote in a message Monday warning voters not to back Democrats.",
      "The state's gubernatorial races almost always go to the party that doesn't control the White House, and are often treated as referenda on the president. Mr. Trump's approval rating in Virginia stands at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to exit poll data.",
      "Virginia used to be reliably red at the national level but has shifted leftward in recent years, backing Democrats in every presidential race since 2008 after voting for Republicans in the nine races before that. Democrats faced some slippage last year: Mr. Trump lost in the state by 5.7 points last year, compared to a 10.1-point loss in 2020.",
      "Spanberger sought to brand herself as a moderate, campaigning for part of the closing stretch with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a fellow moderate, and touting endorsements from two former Republican lawmakers.",
      "Meanwhile, Earle-Sears tried to follow Gov. Glenn Youngkin's strategy in 2021 and capitalize on some of the more polarizing parts of the Democratic agenda, attacking Spanberger on immigration enforcement and transgender issues. \"Spanberger is for they/them, not us,\" said one Earle-Sears ad that closely mirrored one of last year's best-known pro-Trump advertisements.",
      "Earle-Sears also railed against Spanberger over Democratic Attorney General candidate Jay Jones, who sent violent and incendiary texts about Virginia Republicans.",

      "\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth said.",
      "\"Two male narco-terrorists\" aboard the vessel were killed, the defense secretary added, noting that no U.S. personnel were killed in the operation. No further information was provided.",
      "Dating back to early September, the Trump administration has reported well over a dozen such strikes in the waters of the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean off South America on what it alleges are drug vessels. The strikes have killed more than 50 people.",
      "Outside of the unclassified videos released by the Defense Department, the U.S. has provided no details on the boats that were struck or about the people aboard.",
      "The White House says they are part of an effort to cripple the operations of drug cartels. Some lawmakers have criticized the strikes, saying the White House has not provided enough evidence the boats were smuggling drugs, and with some insisting the president needs congressional approval to carry out the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump on Oct. 23 told reporters, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",
      "Several of the strikes have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, as Mr. Trump has been vocal in his criticism of controversial Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and amid a broader buildup of U.S. military assets in the Caribbean.",

      "Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger will defeat Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the Virginia gubernatorial race, CBS News projected Tuesday, marking one of Democrats' first major victories since President Trump's win last year.",
      "Spanberger will be Virginia's first female governor.",
      "Virginia's off-year gubernatorial race tends to serve as a referendum on the president who was elected a year prior \u2014 and historically, the president's party has almost always lost.",
      "National politics were a throughline in this year's race, especially the Trump administration's sweeping federal layoffs and the still-unresolved month-long government shutdown, which has forced most federal workers to go without pay. Both issues are potent in Virginia, which has nearly 150,000 federal civilian jobs and is home to scores of military personnel.",
      "Spanberger, a former CIA officer and congresswoman, positioned herself as an adversary of the Trump administration and sought to link Earle-Sears to Mr. Trump. She frequently tried to capitalize on frustration over federal layoffs and Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Virginia has moved leftward in recent years, driven by shifts in the fast-growing suburbs of Washington, D.C., though Democrats lost ground last year, with Mr. Trump boosting his share of the statewide vote from 44% in 2020 to 46.1% in 2024.",
      "A year later, however, the president's approval rating in Virginia stands at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to exit poll data \u2014 a possible liability for Republicans.",
      "But the race also follows months of uncertainty for the Democratic Party, which was stung by its 2024 loss and is still riven by disagreements between its moderate and progressive factions on the party's strategy moving forward. Meanwhile, just 34% of U.S. adults hold a favorable view of the party, compared to 41% for the GOP, according to a CBS News poll from last month.",
      "Earle-Sears, a Marine Corps veteran and former state lawmaker, took aim at Spanberger over immigration and the participation of transgender students in school sports.",
      "In recent weeks, the race has been dominated by a scandal in the usually lower-profile Virginia attorney general election, after text messages surfaced showing Democratic nominee Jay Jones used violent and incendiary language toward Republicans. Spanberger condemned the messages, but Earle-Sears pressed her to call for Jones to drop out of the race.",
      "Spanberger campaigned in the closing stretch with high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "Earle-Sears drew on support from Virginia's popular but term-limited incumbent Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whose economic record Earle-Sears has touted.",
      "But the Republican candidate wasn't explicitly endorsed by Mr. Trump, the leader of her party, even though the president gave his \"complete and total endorsement\" to the GOP nominees in Virginia's attorney general race and New Jersey's gubernatorial race.

    "summary": "The federal government was unable to avert a lapse in funding. Here's a look at the 14 other shutdowns that have occurred since 1980.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down\u00a0on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding. Some 35 days later, it surpassed the record for longest shutdown on record.",
      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018 and early 2019, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Here is a look at the lapses in government funding that have taken place over the past four decades:",
      "Nov. 20, 1981",
      "Duration: Two full days",
      "White House: President Ronald Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0On Nov. 20, 1981, the Senate approved legislation that fell short of spending cuts Reagan had sought. The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The one-day shutdown was not the result of a bitter stalemate, but happened because members of Congress were busy with social commitments.",
      "The New York Times reported at the time\u00a0that \"congressional leaders barred a late-night session because of major social events tonight by both Republicans and Democrats.\" Reagan had invited members of Congress to a barbecue at the White House, while Democrats had a $1,000-per-plate fundraising dinner.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown arose in part from Reagan's opposition to a measure that included billions in funding for a jobs creation program and Democrats' opposition to money for the MX missile program.",
      "Congress walked away from the jobs provision but included money for legal support for low-income Americans. Lawmakers also declined to fund the missile program, but Reagan still signed the legislation to end the shutdown.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown stemmed from Democrats adding roughly $1 billion in education spending, and cutting foreign aid. House Democrats ended up decreasing their request for education spending to $100 million and provided money for the MX missile, which Reagan wanted. Democrats kept their cuts to foreign aid and defense.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Reagan and congressional Democrats were at odds over several provisions included in a funding bill that cleared the House, namely a crime bill favored by the president, and a water projects measure he opposed. Democrats also wanted legislation reversing a Supreme Court decision that found entire colleges that did not accept federal or state funding were not subject to Title IX's requirements even though their students did receive federal assistance.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The stopgap funding measure passed days earlier didn't do enough to stave off another shutdown. Democrats ultimately gave in and removed the water projects and civil rights provisions, and Congress passed the crime bill.",

      "White House: Reagan",
      "Senate control: Democrats",
      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0The lapse in government funding was the result of disagreement over providing aid to the Contras in Nicaragua and Democrats' push to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine, a policy from the Federal Communications Commission that required broadcast licensees to cover different sides of controversial issues. The rule was repealed in 1987.",
      "In the end, Congress approved nonlethal aid for the Nicaraguan rebels, but Democrats were unsuccessful in their efforts to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine.",

      "House control: Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Bush said he would veto a short-term funding measure that did not include a plan to reduce the deficit, forcing a shutdown. Congress ultimately passed a joint budget resolution that outlined a plan for reducing the deficit, and the president signed a continuing resolution that reopened the government.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdowns that occurred during Clinton's presidency centered around his dispute with congressional Republicans of their pledge to balance the budget and repeal the president's 1993 tax increases. The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",
      "The GOP-led Congress passed a short-term continuing resolution that sought to boost Medicare premiums and required the president to balance the budget within seven years, among other measures. But Clinton vetoed the legislation, which led to a shutdown.",
      "Clinton and Republican congressional leaders ultimately reached a deal to fund the government for several weeks and allow negotiations to continue.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The additional time given to Congress and the White House in November to continue talks wasn't enough, and funding lapsed again in mid-December. Unlike the November 1985 shutdown, this one lasted much longer, into early January 1996.",
      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this. I mean, it's gotten to the point where it's a little ridiculous, as far as this senator is concerned.\"",

      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The fight began over the Affordable Care Act and a push by Republicans to dismantle key parts of Obama's signature health care law. The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",
      "House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner in the end ceded to Democrats and approved a short-term spending bill that didn't include changes to Obamacare.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown, which officially began on the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration, stemmed from a fight over immigration, and specifically Democrats' demands for protections for \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",
      "In the end, Democrats relented after Republicans pledged to work toward a deal addressing DACA, and Trump signed a short-term funding bill that reopened the government.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",
      "House control: Republicans/Democrats",
      "What happened:\u00a0Months later, immigration was again at the center of the government funding fight, though this shutdown involved Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "As the shutdown stretched to become \u2014 until this year \u2014 the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided once again to nominate Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator, he announced Tuesday evening, months after withdrawing the tech billionaire and private astronaut's nomination because of concerns about his political leanings.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Isaacman to the Senate-confirmed post last year, but announced in late May he had decided to withdraw Isaacman after a \"thorough review\" of his \"prior associations.\"",
      "Weeks after the withdrawal, the president went further in expressing his concerns about Isaacman's credentials. At the time, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he thought Isaacman \"was very good,\" but had been \"surprised to learn\" that Isaacman was a \"blue-blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"",
      "Federal Election Commission records\u00a0show\u00a0Isaacman has donated to Democratic congressional candidates and Democratic aligned groups, though he has also given some money to Republicans. Isaacman has\u00a0described himself\u00a0as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and said he disclosed his political donations to Democrats prior to his nomination.",
      "Isaacman has had the endorsement of a powerful fellow tech entrepreneur, Mr. Trump's former adviser, Elon Musk. Isaacman, the CEO and founder of credit card-processing company Shift4, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with Musk's company SpaceX. He bought a series of spaceflights from SpaceX, which has extensive contracts with NASA to transport astronauts and equipment.",
      "The president and Musk had a very public falling-out earlier this year, but are now on better terms. Last week, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Musk have spoken \"on and off\" since sitting together at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's funeral last month in Arizona and that their relationship is \"good.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested that he withdrew Isaacman's nomination in part because of his relationship with Musk, saying he \"thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life.\"",
      "Isaacman said on X he \"only know[s] Elon professionally\" and does not own any equity in SpaceX, but he has a \"firsthand appreciation for what he and his companies have accomplished.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made no mention of his previous decision to nominate and then withdraw Isaacman in his Tuesday evening announcement of the re-nomination on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,\" Trump posted. \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman thanked the president and the \"space-loving community\" Tuesday in a post on X, writing: \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been serving as interim NASA administrator. The president on Tuesday praised Duffy for doing an \"incredible job.\"",

    "summary": "Former Vice President Dick Cheney, one of the most powerful people to hold the office, has died, his family says. He was 84.",
    "story": [
      "Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a force in Republican politics for over 30 years and one of the most powerful people to hold the second-highest office in the U.S., has died. He was 84.",
      "In\u00a0a statement, Cheney's family said he died Monday night of complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, surrounded by his wife of 61 years, Lynne, daughters Liz and Mary and other family members.",
      "Before becoming vice president in the George W. Bush administration, Cheney served as defense secretary, White House chief of staff and a Wyoming congressman.",
      "In the statement, his family called Cheney \"a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing. We are grateful beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.\"",
      "In 2000, Cheney was asked by Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, to help pick his running mate. In the end, it was Cheney's own name that topped the list. He would, it was believed, provide gravitas and broad Washington experience for the younger Texas governor.",
      "\"He really wanted me to come on board because he thought I could help govern, be part of his team, and that he wanted me involved in everything,\" Cheney told CBS' \"60 Minutes II.\"",
      "He was viewed as one of the most powerful vice presidents in U.S. history; at the same time, he became a lightning rod for those who opposed the war in Iraq and the expansion of presidential powers.",
      "\"Cheney really drastically changed the presidency, the vice president's role and our standing in the international community,\" presidential historian Alexis Coe told CBS News.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Bush called Cheney a \"calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges.\"",
      "\"I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best,\" Bush said. \"He held to his convictions and prioritized the freedom and security of the American people. For those two terms in office, and throughout his remarkable career, Dick Cheney's service always reflected credit on the country he loved.\"",
      "In recent years, Cheney saw his daughter Liz Cheney achieve political prominence as a Wyoming GOP representative in Congress known for her open criticism of President Trump. She lost her position as the top Republican woman in the House over her fight with Mr. Trump about his baseless claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. She went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and continued to warn of the danger that she said Mr. Trump posed to democracy, even campaigning for his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, in 2024.",
      "Dick Cheney cut an ad for his daughter's failed 2022 reelection campaign backing her position, arguing that in U.S. history \"there has never been an individual that was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\"",
      "Cheney shaped Republican Party politics for a generation, but he cast his final presidential ballot in 2024 for a Democrat. In a statement, he said Mr. Trump \"can never be trusted with power again. As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.\"",
      "Early life and rise to power",
      "Richard Bruce Cheney was born in 1941 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and grew up in Wyoming. He attended Yale but dropped out after two years and instead finished his college education at the University of Wyoming. Cheney married his high-school sweetheart Lynne, with whom he had two daughters.",
      "He then moved to Washington, D.C., to begin his career, having avoided the draft and the Vietnam War with deferments beginning in early 1966 because it took him six years to finish college, he later testified before Congress at a confirmation hearing.",
      "By age 34, he was White House chief of staff for President Gerald Ford, the youngest person ever to hold the job.",
      "In 1978, he ran for Congress and won the first of six terms in the House, representing Wyoming. In 1989, he was chosen to be secretary of defense in the administration of President George H.W. Bush.",
      "In 1991, he oversaw the U.S. victory in the first Gulf War, when Iraqi forces were driven out of Kuwait. For years afterward, he defended the decision not to invade Baghdad.",
      "\"If we had gone on to Baghdad, if we had sort of accepted the responsibility for occupying the country, governing Iraq, putting a new government in place, running Saddam to ground, I think there would have been significant additional U.S. casualties,\" Cheney said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" in 1992. \"I can't say how many, but the proposition is how many additional American lives is Saddam Hussein worth? And my answer to that question is, not very darn many.\"",
      "In 1995, Cheney became chairman and CEO of Halliburton, the world's largest oil field services company, his first corporate job. His salary and stock options made him a multimillionaire. But in 2000 he left the company to join the Republican ticket.",
      "\"This election is about real choices \u2014 we are talking about the future of our nation,\" Cheney said at a 2000 post-debate rally in Kentucky.",
      "The presidential campaign was bitterly contested and its outcome was undecided on election night, with Florida too close to call, though Bush had a slight lead. Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, asked for recounts in four counties, as Bush sued to stop the recounts. The race was ultimately decided five weeks after the election by a 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court.",
      "A turning point in history",
      "The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States proved to be the defining moment for the new administration \u2014 particularly, it seemed, for Cheney. Even as the U.S. struck al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan, Cheney warned of a larger web of U.S. enemies, urging military action against Iraq and Saddam Hussein.",
      "\"Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,\" Cheney told the Veterans of Foreign Wars in 2002.",
      "Baghdad fell only three weeks after the U.S. invasion in 2003. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, and American forces began a long, deadly occupation.",
      "\"It's hard to explain how important he was, actually, during those Iraq war days,\" Republican strategist Kevin Sheridan told CBS News. \"He was truly central to everything that America did to respond to 9/11. He's obviously received a lot of criticism since for it.\"",
      "Even so, the Bush-Cheney team made national security the centerpiece of the 2004 presidential campaign.",
      "\"If we make the wrong choice, the danger is that we'll get hit again,\" Cheney said at a town hall meeting in Des Moines, Iowa.",
      "The president and Cheney were returned to office in a close election.",
      "But as the situation in Iraq disintegrated and U.S. casualties mounted, public opinion turned against the conflict and the administration.",
      "In November 2006, Democrats won majorities in both houses of Congress, swept in primarily by anti-war sentiment.",
      "To his many detractors, Cheney was a man obsessed with secrecy, the threat of terrorism and strengthening presidential power.",
      "Cheney and Bush ignored the critics.",
      "But in his second term, the president broke with Cheney on the firing of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the offer of talks to North Korea, and the refusal of a pardon for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby. Libby was convicted in 2007 of lying to a grand jury but ultimately pardoned by President Trump in 2018.",
      "At the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama, Cheney appeared in a wheelchair because of a back injury.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-airspace-government-shutdown-transportation-secretary-sean-duffy/",
    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency may need to close \"certain parts\" of the nation's airspace if the shutdown drags on.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation may need to close \"certain parts of the airspace\" if the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on record continues into next week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" Duffy said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "He added, \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe.\"",
      "Throughout the 35-day federal shutdown, set to become the longest in U.S. history, Duffy has maintained that commercial air travel remains safe. The tradeoff is that passengers are experiencing more flight delays as officials slow flight traffic based on staffing levels to ensure that the national airspace remains well-monitored, Duffy\u00a0has said at earlier press conferences.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while an additional 4,700 trips were delayed on Monday, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "Duffy said on social media on Wednesday that 46% of the previous day's flight delays were due to staffing issues in air traffic control towers. Ordinarily, personnel issues account for roughly 5% of such delays, according to aviation data.",
      "\"Draconian steps\"?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the\u00a09/11 terror attacks for national security reasons, while hurricanes and other weather emergencies can also lead to flight restrictions. But closing parts of the nation's airspace because of staffing issues would be unprecedented, according to aviation industry experts.",
      "\"In this particular instance, Duffy is talking about staffing. He knows the strain and stress this is taking on air traffic controllers,\" Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an expert on aviation security, told CBS News.",
      "Closing even a portion of the nation's vast airspace would be a major step and likely impact travel nationwide, he added. The system operates on a so-called hub-and-spoke model in which passengers using regional airports can connect with major airports to travel around the U.S.",
      "If the airspace around New York were to close, for example, it could affect passengers in multiple cities, according to Jacobson.",
      "\"For us to take such draconian steps to shut it down in sectors of the country would be unprecedented,\" he said. \"If you shut down the New York area, you shut down a lot of the country because of the interconnectivity of the hub-and-spoke system.\"",
      "More controllers calling in sick",
      "With air traffic controllers working without pay during the shutdown, more than usual are calling in sick, Duffy has said. He has said he is discouraging them from taking on side gigs like delivering for Uber or DoorDash to make ends meet during the funding lapse, given the level of focus that their job requires.",
      "\"The longer this goes on, every day, these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, and they're being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said Tuesday. \"As every day goes by, I think the problem is going to only get worse. Not better.\"",
      "At an Oct. 28 news conference at LaGuardia Airport in New York, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels emphasized that his organization's members are under mounting financial pressures.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association on Monday urged congressional leaders to end the shutdown, which the industry trade group said could disrupt passengers during the busy Thanksgiving holiday. In 2024, 20 million passengers took to the skies over that week.",
      "\"A shutdown places extraordinary strain on federal personnel who are essential to keeping America moving \u2014 from Transportation Security Administration officers to air traffic controllers, who are forced to work without pay,\" the group said in a Nov. 3 letter. \"When staffing shortages worsen, airport wait times grow longer and flight delays and cancellations become more frequent, threatening to derail family travel plans across the country.\"",

    "summary": "Senators are discussing a deal that would fund the government alongside long-term appropriations bills in exchange for a vote on extending health care tax credits.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The contours of a potential deal to reopen the government began to emerge on Tuesday as the shutdown was poised to become the longest in history, with senators discussing an agreement that would fund the government alongside long-term appropriations bills in exchange for a vote on extending health insurance tax credits that Democrats have demanded.",
      "A bipartisan group of senators has been engaged in conversations in recent days as lawmakers search for an off-ramp in the shutdown fight. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday morning that he's hopeful the bipartisan group is close to a solution, while acknowledging the \"cross-pressures that everybody's feeling\" are \"great.\"",
      "Republicans argue that Democrats are waiting until after Tuesday's elections to back down, claiming they don't want to discourage their base from turning out to vote. A 14th vote on advancing the GOP-backed continuing resolution failed on Tuesday, with no new Democrats crossing the aisle.",
      "Senate Democrats were tight-lipped about a potential deal after a lengthy lunch meeting at the Capitol. \"We had a very good caucus, and we're exploring all the options,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, told reporters that he's \"pretty confident\" the shutdown will end this week: \"I will tell you there's enough Democrats that I'm friends with that were willing to vote last week, and they were assured that Schumer would let them vote the way they need to this week.\"",
      "The bipartisan conversations on Capitol Hill revolve around an effort to move forward on a so-called \"minibus,\" or a package of full-year appropriations bills, in addition to the continuing resolution. Proponents of the plan say that approving the package would demonstrate Republicans' willingness to work on the long-term funding process on a bipartisan basis.",
      "The minibus would include three separate bills. One would fund military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The second would include funding for the legislative branch, and the third would fund the FDA and the Department of Agriculture. Thune told reporters that the continuing resolution to reopen the government could \"ride\" on the appropriations package.",
      "Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican and appropriator, told reporters on Tuesday that she made calls on the issue through the weekend. She said she's hopeful that a package of appropriations bills can be part of what ends the stalemate.",
      "\"The reason we're in this position is that we have not passed appropriations bills,\" Britt said. \"So beginning to break the logjam through doing that, I think, would be incredibly effective.\"",
      "Still, Republicans need to win over at least five more Democrats to reopen the government with a short-term measure. Republicans have said they are willing to guarantee a vote on extending health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act in exchange for Democrats' votes, an offer that has been on the table for weeks. Some GOP senators think enough Democrats may be now willing to \"take yes for an answer,\" as Thune puts it.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who is involved in the talks, outlined the thinking to reporters Tuesday. He said that the appropriations package might entice Democrats to \"vote for something other than just simply a continuing resolution\" while providing \"a path forward\" beyond a vote on the health care tax credits.",
      "Republicans have emphasized a return to regular order in this year's appropriations process and have worked to pass all 12 full-year funding bills, as opposed to a massive year-end funding bill. Appropriators are still aiming to accomplish that goal and avoid a year-long continuing resolution or an omnibus package.",
      "But the continuing resolution would only fund the government until Nov. 21, giving appropriators little time to finish full-year funding. Thune has acknowledged that the deadline must be pushed back, though the exact timing remains up in the air.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the upper chamber, advocated on Monday for a December date. Some lawmakers have argued that a December deadline would increase the chances of resolving the funding fight through individual bills while avoiding a full-year stopgap measure.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson ruled out a December continuing resolution on Tuesday morning, saying \"too many people have concerns\" about a pre-holiday deadline that often results in massive omnibus legislation to fund the government. Thune said later in the day that the date is still being discussed, noting that the expectation is that lawmakers will fund the government through the normal appropriations process. He said nobody wants a year-long continuing resolution, which would extend funding at current levels.",
      "Generally, senators said the talks about an off-ramp were more productive, though they were slim on the details. Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat who's been involved in the conversations, said it was a \"sensitive time\" in the talks.",
      "Collins told reporters Monday that \"we are finally making progress\" in the bipartisan conversations, saying she was \"cautiously hopeful\" that the shutdown will be resolved by the end of the week. On Tuesday, she said \"the talks are more productive because they're more specific.\"",
      "Thune said he's hopeful that \"we'll make some progress\" this week. But any one senator could opt to slow down the process, potentially pushing the impasse into next week.",

      "Olson's research firm produced a 26-page study in April 2022 for a defense lawyer in a Jan. 6 Oathkeepers case to argue for a change of venue out of Washington, D.C. Among the many findings in Olson's survey, respondents in Washington, D.C. were likely to characterize Jan. 6 as an \"insurrection,\" \"racially motivated\" or \"planned in advance\" than prospective jurors in other regions of the country. The survey also argued the jury pool in Washington, D.C. was more likely to feel \"personally\" affected or less safe, because of the Capitol siege by the mob of Trump supporters.",
      "Dozens of Jan. 6 defendants sought a change-of-venue, several using Olson's research study in their arguments.\u00a0 None of them succeeded in their arguments.\u00a0 But Olson's lawsuits allege some defense attorneys used her study in court, without paying her a fee for her service or the rights to use her material.",
      "James Bartolomei, a civil attorney representing Olson in her lawsuits, told CBS News, \"Each lawyer exploited the entire written report for the very same purpose that she created it, which was for use in support of a motion to transfer venue out of DC. The report has a fair market value of $30,000 per case.\"",
      "One of Olson's lawsuits alleged D.C.-based defense attorney Kira West \"pirated a copyrighted expert report and used that report in three separate criminal cases for the very purpose the report was originally created.\" A CBS News review found Olson's research was included in court motions filed by West in multiple cases, including her defense of Alex Harkrider, who was accused of carrying a tomahawk axe while amid the mob. He was found guilty in 2024 of felony charges of civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon.",
      "Harkrider, along with more than 1,500 other Jan. 6 defendants, was pardoned by President Trump on Inauguration Day 2025.",
      "West declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Olson has filed a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging federal public defenders also misappropriated her jury research while defending Jan. 6 defendants. She alleges federal defenders published her report, in its entirety, at least 11 separate times. The suit alleges Olson \"was unaware of the government's unauthorized use until she stumbled upon a copy of her report with a file stamp of multiple illegible case numbers stamped on top\" of\u00a0 other case numbers.\"",
      "Olson's lawsuit against the Trump administration argues, \"The Government, through the public defenders alleged above, directly benefitted financially from copyright infringement of the April 2022 Report by not paying Plaintiff a reasonable fair market value licensing fee for each use of the Report, which is $30,000 per use.\"",
      "The lawsuit said, \"In exchange for a $30,000 fee, Plaintiff licensed a copy of the Report to the Requesting Attorneys, authorizing them to use it in support of their motions to transfer venue based on alleged prejudicial bias in the District of Columbia's jury pool.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House clarified Tuesday that the Trump administration is complying with a federal court order that requires it to tap into a contingency fund to provide food benefits to tens of millions of Americans after President Trump said the aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will go out only when Democrats vote to end the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "The reassurance from the White House came after the president wrote in a\u00a0post on Truth Social\u00a0that SNAP benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comment raised questions as to whether the administration would abide by a Rhode Island judge's order to use reserve funds to issue federal food benefits to Americans enrolled in SNAP. Administration lawyers\u00a0told the court\u00a0Monday that it would tap into the contingency pot to issue reduced food stamp payments for November. The Justice Department said in a filing that the Department of Agriculture would provide states with information necessary for calculating the benefits due to each eligible household, which would allow states to then begin disbursements.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on X that her agency sent that guidance to states Tuesday morning, but warned it would be a \"cumbersome process\" that could result in a weeks-long delay in food stamp payments going out recipients.",
      "\"If the government opens, families get their FULL benefit much more quickly,\" she wrote.",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's comments by CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration is \"fully complying\" with the court's order, but stressed that \"it's going to take some time\" for recipients to receive the payments.",
      "\"We are digging into a contingency fund that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes, for war, and the president does not want to have to tap into this fund in the future,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt said that in order for beneficiaries to receive their full benefits, Democrats need to vote to fund federal agencies and end the shutdown. Administration officials have said fully covering those allotments for November would require roughly $9 billion, but there is only about $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover this month's benefit payments.",
      "\"Democrats are holding it up and making it difficult for the administration to get those payments out the door,\" she said.",
      "The government shutdown entered its 35th day Tuesday and is on track to become the longest in U.S. history later in the day, surpassing the lapse in federal funding that occurred during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to purchase food each month. The program is funded by the federal government and administered by states, which distribute the nutrition assistance to eligible participants. But the Department of Agriculture said late last month that the food aid would not go out to recipients on Nov. 1 because \"the well has run dry\" amid the government shutdown.",
      "The notice followed the Trump administration's decision not to use roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep the benefits flowing to Americans who rely on SNAP for November. The Department of Agriculture told states in a memo last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to cover regular benefits.\"",
      "Ahead of the cutoff of food benefits at the start of the month, a group of 25 states and the District of Columbia, and a coalition of municipalities and nonprofit organizations,\u00a0filed two different lawsuits claiming the administration's decision to halt food stamp payments was illegal. They sought court orders requiring the Department of Agriculture to use the contingency fund for this month's benefits.",
      "In one of the cases, U.S. District Judge John McConnell on Friday ordered the Trump administration to dip into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP payments caused by the shutdown. The judge, who sits in Rhode Island, gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the money.",
      "In its filing with McConnell submitted Monday, the Justice Department said the Agriculture Department would comply with his order and \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today\" by providing state agencies with information about reduced SNAP payments.",
      "Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said in a declaration that the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\" He told the court there is roughly $4.6 billion in the reserve for the November payments, which would be used to cover half of eligible households' allotments.",
      "But he warned the aid would likely not go out immediately because of possible \"payment errors and significant delays\" due to variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofits and municipalities have\u00a0asked McConnell to issue a new order compelling the Trump administration to provide the full SNAP benefits.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 14:34:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Sean Dunn has been charged with a misdemeanor felony count for throwing a sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent during President Trump's federal takeover of D.C.",
    "story": [
      "A Customs and Border Patrol Agent testified in federal court on Tuesday that a sandwich \"exploded all over him\" after a D.C. man threw a sub-style sandwich at him during an expletive-filled rant in protest of President Trump's federal policing crackdown and National Guard deployment in the nation's capital this summer.",
      "Sean Dunn, who was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault charges, has become a symbol of resistance against Mr. Trump's D.C. policing policies, sat in a crowded courtroom as spectators, jury members, and even witnesses attempted to keep a straight face during the first day of his criminal trial.",
      "\"He did it, he threw the sandwich,\" Dunn's attorney Julia Gatto said in her opening statement to a D.C. jury, adding their client has \"very strong feelings\" about the Trump administration's federal takeover of D.C.",
      "Gatto called the viral sub-toss a \"harmless gesture that did not, could not, cause injury.\"",
      "Customs and Border Patrol Agent Gregory Lairmore, who was hit with the footlong sub, testified Tuesday about his experience dealing with Dunn, who can be seen in video of the incident yelling at the agent and other officers in his vicinity before throwing the wrapped sandwich at the officer's chest. Dunn attempted to flee on foot before being apprehended, documents and video of the incident shows.",
      "According to charging documents, Dunn yelled, \"F*** you! You f***ing fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city,\" before crossing the street. He later returned and threw the sandwich.",
      "Lairmore, who says he caught most of Dunn's ire before catching the sandwich in his ballistic vest, saying at one point Dunn was \"red-faced\" and \"enraged\" by the police presence at a crowded intersection in Northwest Washington, D.C.",
      "To laughs in the room, Lairmore walked the jury through the \"baseball pitch\" of a sub throw, as another witness put it.",
      "Lairmore said he \"could feel it through his ballistic vest\" and it \"exploded all over\" him after the Subway stack hit him. He said he \"could smell the onions and mustard\" on his uniform, and even had an onion string hanging by his police radio later that night. The fast-food mustard, he said, stained his shirt.",
      "Dunn's attorneys later pressed Lairmore on two gag gifts that his coworkers bought him after the incident, including a plush submarine sandwich and a \"felony footlong\" patch that Lairmore said he put on his lunchbox.",
      "They also pressed Lairmore on why there are no evidentiary photos of stains on his shirt or of the sandwich after it was thrown, only a video posted to social media platform Instagram from a bystander showing the sandwich mostly intact. Lairmore said the Metropolitan Police Department in D.C. took over the investigation after Dunn was detained, and Lairmore said the sandwich appeared at least \"bent and out of shape\" in its wrapper.",
      "Federal prosecutors failed to secure a felony indictment\u00a0from a grand jury in Washington in the immediate aftermath of the incident, and instead charged Dunn with a federal misdemeanor assault charge for allegedly assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating and interfering with a federal officer.",
      "After his arrest, Dunn was fired from his job as a paralegal in the Justice Department. According to a Justice Department source, Dunn worked at the Office of International Affairs within the department's Criminal Division as a paralegal.",
      "In a post on X announcing Dunn's firing, Attorney General Pam Bondi called Dunn \"an example of the Deep State we have been up against.\"",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., said in a video announcing the arrest that her office is \"going to back the police to the hilt. So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else.\"",

    "summary": "Election Day 2025 is here, with consequential races in New York City, New Jersey, Virginia and a redistricting ballot measure in California.",
    "story": [
      "Election Day 2025 is here, with closely watched local races in New York City, New Jersey and Virginia, as well as the Proposition 50 redistricting ballot measure in California \u2014 all of which may be viewed as early bellwethers for next year's midterm elections.",
      "Here are the races to watch Tuesday:",
      "New York City mayor's race",
      "New York City's highly watched mayoral election is a rare three-person race that has attracted the attention of a former New Yorker, President Trump.",
      "Democrats chose Queens state Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani as their nominee in the June primary, a democratic socialist whose campaign on affordability has been embraced by the grassroots. New York City is heavily Democratic, so the winner of the party's primary is generally considered the favorite to win in November. Mamdani defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who led polls early in the mayoral race.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams, who was indicted on federal corruption charges in September 2024, which were dropped in the early days of the Trump administration, skipped the June Democratic primary, instead opting to be on the ballot as an independent candidate. But facing a lack of funds and polling in the single digits, Adams dropped out in September and later\u00a0threw his support behind Cuomo.",
      "Cuomo has remained in the race, and although he lagged in raising money earlier in the race, his fundraising improved in October after Adams dropped out. Mamdani, meanwhile, has shattered fundraising expectations, with his campaign saying it reached the $8 million spending cap for New York City matching funds in early September.",
      "A trio of polls released on Oct. 30 showed Mamdani with a commanding lead, though others earlier in the week showed an uptick in support for Cuomo. Early voting has substantially risen compared to 2021. Since Oct. 25, more than 730,000 New Yorkers\u00a0have cast their ballots early, compared to the\u00a0nearly 170,000 who cast their ballots early in 2021.",
      "If Mamdani, 34, wins, he will become the second-youngest mayor in New York City history as well as the first Muslim mayor. He was first elected to the state Assembly in 2020 to represent Astoria, Queens \u2014 one of the most progressive parts of New York City. Mamdani said he will ask New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch to stay on if he wins. She has not yet said whether she will accept.",
      "Cuomo, who was elected New York governor three times before resigning amid sexual misconduct allegations, has tried to paint Mamdani as an elitist, since his father is a Columbia University professor and his mother is a film director. Cuomo's father, Mario Cuomo, was a three-term governor of New York. Andrew Cuomo has also attacked Mamdani for living in a rent-stabilized apartment, even as Cuomo himself moved to his daughter's apartment in New York City before he ran for mayor.",
      "Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee in 2021, is back on the ballot on the GOP line, although some Republicans have called on him to drop out to help Cuomo's candidacy. Mr. Trump has called Sliwa \"not exactly prime time\" and suggested Cuomo would be a better mayor.",
      "All 51 seats of the New York City Council are also on the ballot. There is also a voter initiative on moving local elections to presidential election years.",
      "New Jersey governor's race",
      "Former GOP New Jersey state Rep. Jack Ciattarelli is making his third run for governor, after losing to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in 2021. He's facing off against Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who's trying to deliver Democrats a third consecutive term in the governor's mansion, a feat that has not been accomplished by either party since the 1970s.",
      "Sherrill, who flipped a Republican congressional seat in 2018, is running as a moderate and trying to tie Ciattarelli to Mr. Trump. But Ciattarelli has accused Sherrill in a September debate of blaming Mr. Trump for everything.",
      "Both Ciattarelli and Sherrill are appealing to voters' concerns about the high cost of living: Ciattarelli is touting a \"Make New Jersey Affordable Again\" pitch, while Sherrill features an \"Affordability Agenda\" on her campaign website.",
      "In September, CBS News reported that a branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Sherrill's military records to an ally of Ciattarelli in error. Republicans allied with Ciattarelli have been examining Sherrill's record in the Navy, looking for information about a Naval Academy cheating scandal that implicated over 100 midshipmen. Sherrill was not accused of wrongdoing but did not walk in her graduation, which she said was because she \"didn't turn in some of my classmates.\" Sherrill had an unblemished career in the Navy and, as a midshipman, received a Navy Achievement Medal in 1991 for saving the life of a classmate.",
      "Virginia governor's race",
      "Virginia governors may not run for consecutive terms under state law, so Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is not on the ballot.",
      "Virginia's gubernatorial election is often seen as a potential referendum on the incumbent president. The president's party often loses the Virginia governor's race, which always falls in the year following a presidential election. In recent history, Terry McAuliffe bucked that trend when he won the election in 2013, a year after President Barack Obama's reelection.",
      "The Trump administration's broadsides against the federal workforce hit Virginia hard, since the state has hundreds of thousands of civilian federal employees and thousands of government contractors and active-duty military. Most are going without pay during the government shutdown that's now stretching into its second month.",
      "Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is running against former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger in the race. Either Spanberger or Earle-Sears will make history as the commonwealth's first female governor, and if Earle-Sears wins, she will become the first female Black governor.",
      "One of Youngkin's paths to victory in 2021 was tying McAuliffe, who was running for a non-consecutive term, to unpopular progressive social issues, which Earle-Sears has tried to replicate in the race against Spanberger. But Spanberger, a former CIA operations officer, has run as a centrist and has touted endorsements from the Virginia Police Benevolent Association, which backed Youngkin in 2021, as well as former Republican Reps. Barbara Comstock and Denver Riggleman.",
      "Mr. Trump has not endorsed Earle-Sears, although he appeared in a telerally on Monday night for the Republican ticket.",
      "Virginia attorney general's race",
      "Democrat Jay Jones was leading incumbent Jason Miyares in a Washington Post poll in early October in the Virginia attorney general's race, but before the poll was released, text messages Jones had sent in 2022 resurfaced involving fantasies of violence against Todd Gilbert, who was then the Republican speaker of the House of Delegates.",
      "In a statement to CBS News when the messages resurfaced, Jones said he took full responsibility for his actions.",
      "But Republicans, including the president, have called on Jones to drop out. Miyares has seized on the controversy, running ads saying, \"Can you trust Jay Jones to protect your children?\"",
      "In a Washington Post poll conducted from Oct. 16-21 \u2014 after the text messages were released \u2014 Jones and Miyares were statistically tied with 46% each.",
      "California's Proposition 50",
      "Proposition 50 would allow California Democrats to temporarily change the boundaries of U.S. House districts and make them more favorable to the party. The initiative is their response to Mr. Trump's push for Republican-controlled states, like Texas, to change their congressional maps so the GOP has a better chance at holding on to its narrow House majority next year.",
      "California has 52 congressional districts, 43 represented by Democrats and nine by Republicans. The five GOP-led districts targeted under Proposition 50 are District 1, represented by Rep. Doug LaMalfa; District 3, represented by Rep. Kevin Kiley; District 22, represented by Rep. David Valadao; District 41, represented by Rep. Ken Calvert; and District 48, represented by Rep. Darrell Issa.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, who pushed Prop 50 through California's Assembly,\u00a0rallied supporters of the measure in San Francisco on Monday night.",
      "\"We're going to get out there and win and send a powerful message not only to the people of the state of California, but the people all over the United States of America,\" Newsom said.",
      "A recent CBS News poll found that among voters who plan to support Proposition 50, one reason they're doing so is to oppose the Trump administration \u2014 which they also feel generally treats California worse than other states \u2014 and oppose national Republicans.",
      "Prop 50, according to the poll, has 62% support among likely voters.",
      "In total, more than $167.9 million has been raised in support of Prop 50 as of Oct. 28, according to the California Secretary of State's office. According to the Secretary of State's office, Top donors supporting Prop 50 include the House Majority PAC for Proposition 50, with $46 million in contributions, and billionaire investor George Soros' Fund for Policy Reform, with $10 million.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will consider Wednesday whether a federal emergency powers law gives President Trump the authority to impose his most sweeping tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For Lindsay Hagerman, the past few months have felt tumultuous.",
      "As the co-owner of the Pennsylvania-based RainCaper, which sells art-inspired travel accessories and gifts, Hagerman has found herself questioning her pricing strategy while watching tariffs on goods imported from China see-saw from 10% to 20% to 145% \u2014 and then back down again.",
      "\"Is it temporary? Is this the new normal? You're struggling with how do we price \u2014 do we change prices now? Wait? I don't want to gouge people,\" Hagerman told CBS News. \"That's not how you do good business. But I also need to cover expenses.\"",
      "RainCaper, which Hagerman founded with her mother nearly a decade ago, sells rain capes, travel accessories, umbrellas, scarves, shawls and drinkware to boutiques, museum stores, retailers and directly to consumers through its website.",
      "Her company imports umbrellas and rain capes made from a waterproof fabric from China, and neither can be made in the U.S., Hagerman said. As a result, RainCaper has found itself on the front lines of President Trump's trade war, which relies heavily on tariffs.",
      "But Hagerman and small business owners across the U.S. could see some stability in the coming weeks, with the Supreme Court set to consider Wednesday whether Mr. Trump has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on nearly every country under a federal emergency powers law.",
      "Lower courts have ruled his most sweeping duties are illegal, and a decision from the Supreme Court upholding those decisions could deal a blow to the president's efforts to use tariffs as leverage in negotiations with foreign countries and to pressure U.S. companies to invest in domestic manufacturing. But a ruling from the high court against Mr. Trump, who appointed three of the justices, could also have significant implications for presidential power.",
      "Since he announced the sweeping global tariffs earlier this year, many small businesses have had to devote time and resources to keeping up with the fast-changing fluctuations in the tariff rates and countries targeted, all while making determinations about how to respond to the increased costs of importing the components needed for their products.",
      "At RainCaper, Hagerman has trimmed expenses and laid off two of its seven employees who were working in operations and customer service, she said.",
      "She also explored manufacturing outside of China because of the levies, though Hagerman ultimately decided against it in part because of the significant investment it would require. And as a military spouse whose husband is out of state, she said making trips to countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia to look at other potential facilities wasn't possible.",
      "\"When the administration is saying we're bringing trillions into the economy and saying China is paying these tariffs, Brazil is paying these tariffs, it's just not true,\" Hagerman said. \"Tariffs are borne by the importer. I'm the importer.\"",
      "A \"stark choice\" for the Supreme Court",
      "Mr. Trump has invoked a federal law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose two different sets of tariffs through a series of executive orders. The first set a baseline rate of 10% on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 countries; and the second targeted China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of varying rates.",
      "In his executive orders, the president declared trade deficits and the flood of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. as national emergencies, which unlocked IEEPA's powers. The law authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security, foreign policy or the U.S. economy, which he said trade imbalances and drug trafficking constitute.",
      "Since Mr. Trump announced the tariffs in February and April \u2014 on what he called \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 the administration has reached trade deals with 10 countries and the European Union, and said it is \"actively negotiating\" with more foreign nations.",
      "But soon after the president announced the tariffs, two sets of small businesses and a group of 12 states filed lawsuits arguing that IEEPA doesn't authorize the sweeping duties. Lower courts have ruled against the administration, finding that IEEPA doesn't give the president the power to unilaterally impose the global and trafficking tariffs.",
      "In one of the cases, involving a group of five small businesses and Democratic officials from 12 states, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7-4 that many of the president's levies are illegal. But the Federal Circuit set aside a lower court's injunction, which has allowed the Trump administration to keep collecting the global and trafficking tariffs for now.",
      "Mr. Trump has also continued to rely on IEEPA to impose new levies or tweak existing rates, including raising Canadian tariffs to 35%, though many of its goods are exempt,\u00a0imposing an additional 40% duty on Brazil and threatening China with an additional 100% duty, though the president has since walked that back. Mr. Trump then announced last week after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would be reducing the tariffs on goods imported from China.",
      "The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to uphold the levies, arguing that Congress has long given the president broad authority to impose tariffs to address emergencies. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing\u00a0that IEEPA is a continuation of that tradition because it gives the president the power to \"regulate \u2026 importation.\"",
      "Sauer also asserted that the tariffs are an exercise of Mr. Trump's power over national security and foreign affairs, and argued courts should give deference to his determination that the duties are best suited for addressing national emergencies arising from trade deficits and drug trafficking.",
      "Invalidating those levies, he said, would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for national security, foreign policy and the economy.",
      "\"To the President, these cases present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has called the case \"one of the most important in the history of the country\" and had said he planned to attend the arguments in-person. But he reversed course Sunday, writing on social media that he did \"not want to distract from the importance of this decision.\"",
      "Lawyers for the small businesses told the high court in papers that Mr. Trump's tariffs have significant economic consequences. An analysis from the Tax Foundation found the duties will impose $1.7 trillion in new taxes on Americans by 2035, reduce GDP growth by 0.7% per year, and reduce income by 1.1% in 2026.",
      "No president has used IEEPA to levy tariffs \u2014 until now \u2014 and the law makes no mention of that word or others like it. Neal Katyal, who will argue on behalf of the small businesses before the Supreme Court, warned in filings that the Trump administration's interpretation of IEEPA is a \"breathtaking assertion\" of power that requires explicit authorization from Congress.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with Mr. Trump that the power to tax is found in IEEPA through the phrase \"regulate \u2026 importation,\" then \"the president, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could tax everything from autos to zoos,\" Katyal wrote in a filing.",
      "\"The government's theory is really that the president has the ability to impose sales taxes, property taxes, use taxes, essentially a wealth tax under IEEPA,\" Timothy Meyer, an expert in international law at Duke Law, told CBS News. \"The justices are going to have to confront this really extraordinary breadth of the government's argument.\"",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that trade deficits hardly constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat,\" as imbalances have lasted for five decades, and Mr. Trump himself has described them as \"persistent.\"",
      "Additionally, the power to levy taxes and duties rests squarely with Congress, and any delegations of that power have been \"explicit and strictly limited,\" they said. And indeed, there are numerous other statutes in which Congress has delegated its tariffing power \u2014 some of which have been used by Mr. Trump \u2014 though they put constraints on the president.",
      "\"The reason that President Trump likes IEEPA is because unlike every other statute that delegates to the president the authority to impose tariffs, IEEPA requires no process before the president can act, requires no investigation, no fact-finding other than an unreviewable declaration of a national emergency, and it places no limits on what the president can do in terms of the amount of the duty or the length of time that they can remain in place,\" Meyer said.",
      "He continued: \"The reason it doesn't do any of those things is because it doesn't mention duties at all, so it seems pretty likely that Congress did not intend to include substantial power to impose tariffs in the statute.\"",
      "Jeffrey Bialos, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland who specializes in international law, predicted that if Mr. Trump prevails before the Supreme Court, future administrations would likely use IEEPA's authority to set out broad tariffs rather than look to other authorities that are more narrow and impose certain requirements.",
      "\"This isn't foreign affairs. It's a question of what is permissible to delegate under Article I Section 8, and what kind of authority you need,\" Bialos said. \"Did Congress intend to allow the president to throw out the entire tariff code of the United States? That's the import of what was done here.\"",
      "A test of presidential authority",
      "Mr. Trump has spent his first months back in the White House flexing his presidential authority in other ways, including through his firings of executive branch officials and the withholding of $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress.",
      "When those cases made their way to the Supreme Court in their early stages, the conservative justices have in most instances allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce certain policies while proceedings in the lower courts continue.",
      "In the dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs, the Supreme Court will weigh the legal merits of the case, something it has not yet done in the others. But the court battle, like those others, could have implications for the power the president is seeking to assert.",
      "\"What the Supreme Court is really deciding here is whether or not to give the administration a free pass any time it's able to connect some sort of policy initiative to some sort of international dimension,\" Meyer said. \"If you create a system in which you get deference if you can characterize something as a foreign affairs issue, but there's no deference if it's done by an administrative agency pursuing some sort of statutory delegation, then the administration will just do as much as it can through emergency and international affairs powers.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad assertions of executive authority on issues of major political and economic significance when Congress has not spoken clearly, invoking what's called the major questions doctrine to invalidate former President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student loan debt and block an eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "That legal principle is raised in the battle over his tariffs, though the Trump administration argues that it doesn't apply to matters of national security and foreign policy. But lawyers for the small businesses counter that tariffs are a tax on the American people, and the Constitution has vested the taxing power in Congress.",
      "\"Taxing American citizens is not national security or foreign policy, and the tariffs are paid by Emily Ley and other ordinary Americans,\" said Mark Chenoweth, president and chief legal officer at the New Civil Liberties Alliance. The organization is representing a Pensacola-based stationary company and its CEO, Emily Ley, in a different challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs. That case is not before the Supreme Court.",
      "\"To argue that unilateral taxation of American citizens is national security or foreign policy is incorrect,\" Chenoweth said. \"We fought a Revolutionary War over the idea of taxation without representation, and that's what this would be if the president can unilaterally raise taxes on American citizens.\"",
      "A \"mass extinction\" of small businesses",
      "While lower courts have agreed that Mr. Trump's global and trafficking tariffs are illegal, the government has continued to collect the duties as the Supreme Court weighs the cases.",
      "For Julie Robbins, CEO of EarthQuaker Devices, that has meant paying nearly $40,000 in levies through the end of October.",
      "The family-owned company makes guitar pedals and manufactures its products in Akron, Ohio. EarthQuaker's product line includes 50 pedals that require more than 900 unique components that it sources from 15 different countries, including Mexico, Portugal, Poland, Ukraine and several in Asia.",
      "To assist with logistics, Robbins said EarthQuaker works with wholesalers that vet overseas manufacturers and source the mechanical and electrical components needed for its pedals. The wholesalers are paying the tariffs when the items arrive at U.S. ports and then pass along a portion of the duties to EarthQuaker, she said.",
      "Upon hearing Mr. Trump would be imposing his sweeping levies, one of Robbins' first moves was to search for domestic suppliers. She ultimately found they either don't exist for the parts that go into EarthQuaker's guitar pedals or they charge significantly more than her international sources.",
      "Plus, breaking off long-held relationships with overseas suppliers would be risky and disrupt a supply chain that took years to perfect, she said, since there were no guarantees other manufacturers or their products would be reliable.",
      "\"It's taken us 20 years to develop this supply chain,\" she said. \"It's not something that happened overnight and so in order to redo it, I can't see it happening.\"",
      "Robbins said EarthQuaker could save money by having their pedals made in-full overseas, rather than having the parts shipped to the U.S. and the pedals assembled at its production facilities in Ohio. But doing that wouldn't align with the company's values of keeping well-paying jobs in Akron, a city that was once known as the \"Rubber Capital of the World\" for its production of rubber products.",
      "\"When people try to oversimplify and say you should be manufacturing in the United States, we are manufacturing in the United States, but you can't make the raw materials in the U.S.,\" Robbins said.",
      "EarthQuaker doesn't have deep-pocketed investors and has eroded its cash cushion as it has navigated the whiplash of changing tariff rates, she said. The company also opted not to replace employees that have left in recent months, and it pulled two open positions.",
      "\"My concern is there's just going to be this mass extinction of small business,\" Robbins said. \"It's not sustainable.\"",
      "Cephalofair Games, a California-based company that designs and publishes board games, has paid more than $144,000 in new tariffs over the past few months, according to its chief operating officer, Price Johnson.",
      "In July, Cephalofair informed its customers it would be adding \"tariff surcharges\" as a result of the import taxes and has increased the prices of its products. It has also reduced the salaries of staff and furloughed workers.",
      "The company manufactures its games in China and has had to make adjustments to product runs in response to the tariffs. Johnson told CBS News that a run of 7,000 units is nearly completed, but instead of bringing it into the U.S., the company will instead send its games to Europe, the United Kingdom and Australia.",
      "In the meantime, Johnson said the company continues to design and develop new games, but is waiting to hear from the Supreme Court before moving forward with manufacturing.",
      "Cephalofair wasn't impacted by tariffs during the first administration and had been preparing for tariffs on Chinese imports of between 10% and 15%, Johnson said. But these days, he and his colleagues have taken to watching Mr. Trump's social media feed for tariff-related announcements.",
      "The uncertainty has \"removed any ability for us to plan or rely on what we as importers can operate on,\" Johnson said. \"We have to plan on not being able to plan or trust what U.S. policy is surrounding trade.\"",

    "summary": "Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein provided the Justice Department with \"precise and detailed\" information about 20 alleged co-conspirators, House Democrats say.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, is seeking documents from the Justice Department on its move earlier this year to end the investigation into alleged co-conspirators of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"I write to demand an explanation for why DOJ has abandoned the women and girls abused by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators, fired or cut off career prosecutors from the case, and ceased its investigation into one of the largest sex trafficking rings in history,\" Raskin wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, which was first obtained by CBS News.",
      "The demand comes amid relentless bipartisan interest in the investigation, which has dogged the Justice Department's top officials as they've sought to put the matter to rest. Some in the Trump administration, including Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, promised major revelations into the Epstein matter before taking office, only to indicate later that the case was closed.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on Raskin's letter and will update this story with any response.",
      "In the letter, Raskin said almost 50 survivors provided information to prosecutors and FBI agents as part of the investigation that ultimately led to the indictments of Epstein in 2019 and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2020. Raskin said the information the survivors provided was \"precise and detailed.\"",
      "\"They described how Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators orchestrated a sophisticated and clandestine sex trafficking conspiracy that trafficked them to at least 20 men,\" Raskin said. \"These survivors shared with DOJ and FBI the specific identities of many of these co-conspirators, how this operation was structured and financed, and which individuals facilitated these crimes.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York was running an active investigation into Epstein and Maxwell's co-conspirators until January 2025, when prosecutors were directed to transfer the Epstein case files to the Justice Department's headquarters, in what Raskin said was \"a sudden and dramatic shift in the posture of the investigation.\" Since then, \"the investigation into co-conspirators has inexplicably ceased,\" he said, citing information provided to the Judiciary Committee by attorneys who represent Epstein survivors.",
      "Then in July, the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review, which it said found no \"client list\" among the evidence collected by investigators. It also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties.\" Bondi suggested during a Fox News interview in February that a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk awaiting her review.",
      "\"DOJ and FBI's failure to investigate this conduct is a betrayal of the more than 1,000 survivors of this multi-billion-dollar international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin wrote. \"As these survivors made clear to DOJ and FBI, Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell did not act alone.\"",
      "Raskin said many of the women spoke with prosecutors and agents, and the interviews were summarized in 302 forms, a document used by the FBI to memorialize information that may later come up in courtroom testimony. Along with the women, Raskin said federal law enforcement agents who worked on the case understood that the investigation was continuing up until January. In Supreme Court filings, Raskin pointed out, the government said the pursuit of Epstein's co-conspirators was ongoing during the Biden administration.",
      "Raskin said the committee is considering reforms that would clarify prosecutors' responsibility to communicate with crime survivors before investigations are closed. And he accused Patel of having \"repeatedly impugned the credibility of the Epstein survivors\" at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September by suggesting that the information provided by the survivors was not credible.",
      "During the hearing, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has led an effort to force a vote in the House on releasing the Epstein files, pointed to 20 alleged co-conspirators.",
      "\"According to victims who cooperated with the FBI in that investigation, these documents in FBI possession, your possession, detail at least 20 men, including Mr. Jes Staley, CEO of Barclays Bank,\" Massie said, referring to a banker who left Barclays in 2021 amid scrutiny over his ties to Epstein. Staley, who worked with Epstein for years as a top official at J.P. Morgan, has said they had a \"close professional relationship.\" Staley has denied wrongdoing and said he regrets befriending Epstein.",
      "Massie said other high-profile figures were among those named by Epstein's victims.",
      "\"That list also includes at least 19 other individuals \u2014 one Hollywood producer worth a few hundred million dollars, one royal prince, one high-profile individual in the music industry, one very prominent banker, one high-profile government official, one high-profile former politician, one owner of a car company in Italy, one rockstar, one magician, at least six billionaires, including a billionaire from Canada,\" Massie said.",
      "Massie asked Patel if the FBI had launched any investigations into the individuals and whether he'd seen the 302 documents. Patel responded that he has asked FBI agents to \"review the entirety of the Epstein files and bring forth any credible information.\" He said \"any investigations that arise from any credible investigation will be brought,\" but he added that there have been \"no new materials brought to me launching a new indictment.\"",
      "Asked whether he was asserting that the victims' statements weren't credible, Patel said, \"It's not my assertion, sir, it's the assertion of two different United States attorneys' offices from three separate administrations who investigated those same materials in live time.\"",
      "Raskin said Patel's explanation, along with a later exchange with Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, was not good enough. He wrote in his letter that he is seeking \"an accounting\" of the steps the Justice Department has taken to review the case this year, relevant summaries or reports generated as part of that review and documents related to staffing for Epstein investigative matters.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has inexplicably killed this investigation,\" Raskin said.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:18:00 -0500",
    "summary": "After his recent remarks about resuming nuclear testing, President Trump told \"60 Minutes\" \"we're the only country that doesn't test.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's comments about restarting weapons tests are not likely to lead to mushroom-cloud explosions over the New Mexico desert or seismic shaking underground in Nevada, according to the nation's foremost experts.",
      "But questions about\u00a0what kind of testing Mr. Trump does have in mind have been rippling through the nuclear nonproliferation community. In an interview on \"60 Minutes,\" the president elaborated on remarks he made last week announcing a plan to resume U.S. testing of nuclear weapons. \"Other countries are testing,\" he said. \"We're the only country that doesn't test, and I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test.\"",
      "The president did not clarify what type of testing he envisions. The U.S. has not conducted above-ground nuclear tests since the 1960s, and the last underground detonation of a nuclear device in the U.S. occurred in 1992. That test, at the Nevada Test Site, was the final nuclear weapons test before the current testing moratorium was put in place.",
      "Asked if he was announcing that after more than 30 years, the United States planned to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing, Mr. Trump replied that \"we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.\"",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" he said. \"You know, we're an open society. We're different. We talk about it... We're going to test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "On Monday, CIA Director John Ratcliffe posted a brief statement on his personal X account that said President Trump \"is right,\" and showed images related to public U.S. assessments from 2019 by the Defense Intelligence Agency that Russia and China were carrying out low-yield nuclear tests.",
      "Low-yield tests involve very small nuclear explosions that can help researchers study a weapon's efficacy, but are generally banned under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The U.S., China and Russia are signatories to that treaty, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1996, but have not ratified it.",
      "There was no mention in Ratcliffe's post of actions by Pakistan or North Korea.",
      "The CIA declined to comment beyond the director's post.",
      "The White House referred a question about clarifying the president's comments on nuclear testing to what Mr. Trump has said.",
      "Nine countries \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India and Israel \u2014 currently possess a combined total of more than 12,000 nuclear warheads, with the U.S. and Russia accounting for nearly 90% of the global stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community's 2025 worldwide threat assessment said Russia's nuclear stockpile was the world's \"largest and most diverse,\" noting that it, in combination with an array of delivery systems, \"could inflict catastrophic damage to the Homeland.\"",
      "The assessment also said China \"remains intent\" on expanding its nuclear posture.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing Monday that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\" And a senior Pakistani security official told CBS News, \"Pakistan was not the first to carry out nuclear tests and will not be the first to resume nuclear tests.\"",
      "George Perkovich, a senior fellow in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Nuclear Policy Program, said experts on nuclear weapons testing believe the president was referencing \"subcritical\" tests, rather than tests that register on the Richter Scale or yield a visible display.",
      "\"These don't produce an explosion. They can be done in laboratories,\" Perkovich said.",
      "Subcritical nuclear tests involve perfecting the final steps in triggering a chain reaction in the lab, and then using computing power to conduct simulations of an actual detonation.",
      "\"Because he kept insisting that everyone else is doing it, I am assuming he means those types of tests that don't involve explosions,\" Perkovich said. \"If these countries have been doing [explosive] tests, then the president just released very highly classified intelligence.\"",
      "Sigfried Hecker, who served as director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1986 to 1997, said the Russians, Chinese and the U.S. all perform subcritical experiments. But another type of nuclear test that the U.S. stopped conducting, called Hydronuclear experiments, involves a tiny amount of explosive \u2013 not enough to be detected by seismic monitors.",
      "\"These are where you barely tickle the bomb, and you get small nuclear reactions,\" Hecker said. \"No mushroom cloud. You're just doing enough to produce a reaction in the plutonium. No risk, no hazard, easily contained. No safety issues.\"",
      "Hecker said he did not know if the president might be referring to that type of test.",
      "\"Whether the president and his advisers are steeped in all of this, I don't know,\" he said.",
      "Samantha Vinograd, a national security expert and CBS News consultant who served as assistant secretary for counterterrorism and threat prevention at the US Department of Homeland Security said \"there are various kinds of tests that the president could be referring to so there are currently a lot of hypotheticals.\"",
      "The White House referred a question about clarifying the president's comments about nuclear testing to what Mr. Trump has said.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright tried to clarify Mr. Trump's nuclear comments in an appearance on Fox News, saying the president was referencing \"systems tests.\"",
      "\"These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright said. \"These are what we call noncritical explosions, so we're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "As energy secretary, Wright is helping oversee the modernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, which he said the president has made a \"critical priority.\"",
      "\"A lot of our weapons are very old and President Trump has been adamant about we have to be on the forefront, we need to be ahead of our adversaries, we need to keep our weapon stockpile modern and upgraded,\" Wright said.",
      "If the U.S. does begin nuclear testing again, China would benefit the most, according to Heather Williams, the director of the Project on Nuclear Issues and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\"The United States has conducted 1,054 tests, and Russia has conducted 715. China only conducted 47 nuclear tests, both above ground and underground,\" Williams said on Saturday.",
      "\"This asymmetry in test data has been a sore spot for Chinese officials who felt disadvantaged by arms control agreements, such as the Partial Test Ban Treaty. If one country returns to nuclear testing, others are likely to follow \u2014 in which case, China would stand to gain the most in terms of weapons design and warhead information, further contributing to its nuclear buildup,\" said Williams.",
      "However, Williams also underscored that both political and scientific leaders have repeatedly said that the U.S. has no technical need to return to nuclear testing.",
      "Olivia  Gazis, \n                                                  \n                                  James  LaPorta and \n                                                  \n                                  Camilla  Schick\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Oct 2025 13:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" the study's co-author said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have long puzzled over the origins of a mysterious dinosaur excavated in the 1940s: Was it a young T. rex or another type of dinosaur?",
      "At first, researchers had only a tyrannosaur skull to go by, making it hard to tell if it belonged to a child or adult. Another skull and skeleton nicknamed Jane added to the debate, but didn't settle the controversy.",
      "Now, a research team says new evidence resolves the case. The latest clue comes from a complete skeleton \u2014 first uncovered in Montana in 2006 \u2014 that scientists say identifies the mystery reptile as its own species and not a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "The discovery \"rewrites decades of research on Earth's most famous predator,\" said study co-author Lindsay Zanno with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and North Carolina State University.",
      "Growth rings within the bones found in Montana's Hell Creek Formation told scientists the new dinosaur was an adult about half the size of a fully fledged T. rex. From growth comparisons to other reptiles like crocodiles, they also found that the major differences between the creature's skull and an adult T. rex's \u2014 changes in bone structure, nerve patterns and sinuses \u2014 were unlikely to form from simply going through puberty.",
      "Signs pointed to a dinosaur that's a distant T. rex cousin known as Nanotyrannus lancensis, the researchers reported in a study published Thursday in the journal Nature, calling it a rival species.",
      "\"Nanotyrannus is a small-bodied predator designed for speed. It's very agile and has long powerful arms [that are] larger than those of the T. rex,\"\u00a0Zanno told Nature.",
      "There's now \"more support and evidence than there ever has been\" that this T. rex relative could exist, said Holly Woodward, a fossil bone expert from Oklahoma State University who had no role in the new study. But she's not yet convinced that the other mystery skeletons like Jane are something new.",
      "Case of mistaken identity",
      "Other independent scientists also said the debate isn't over. The new skeleton is indeed an adult, but it could be a sister species to T. rex and not a distant relative, said vertebrate paleontologist Thomas Carr of Carthage College.",
      "There are similarities between the shape of T. rex's skull and the mystery specimens that keep him from switching camps.",
      "\"I don't think this study settles everything,\" he said.",
      "Resolving this case of mistaken identity is important to understanding how T. rex grew up, said study co-author James Napoli with Stony Brook University. Another big question is whether T. rex was the main predator prowling toward the end of the age of dinosaurs 67 million years ago \u2014 or whether a tinier, but still mighty predator also roamed.",
      "\"I suspect that these two species would have occasionally come into conflict, as predators tend to do, but the long legs of Nanotyrannus, and its small size, suggest that it mostly hunted smaller, faster prey than Tyrannosaurus,\" Napoli told the Reuters news agency.",
      "The new skeleton is dubbed \"Dueling Dinosaurs\" because it was found intertwined with the bones of a Triceratops, and is currently on display at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.",
      "The study comes just days after new research suggested dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike. The evidence came from analyzing a portion of the Kirtland Formation in northern New Mexico that's been known for around 100 years to contain several interesting dinosaur fossils.",
      "In June, scientists identified a smaller-bodied ancestor of the T. rex that roamed the plains of Mongolia as a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",

He bought a series of spaceflights from SpaceX, which has extensive contracts with NASA to transport astronauts and equipment.",
      "The president and Musk had a very public falling-out earlier this year, but are now on better terms. Last week, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Musk have spoken \"on and off\" since sitting together at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's funeral last month in Arizona and that their relationship is \"good.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested that he withdrew Isaacman's nomination in part because of his relationship with Musk, saying he \"thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life.\"",
      "Isaacman said on X he \"only know[s] Elon professionally\" and does not own any equity in SpaceX, but he has a \"firsthand appreciation for what he and his companies have accomplished.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made no mention of his previous decision to nominate and then withdraw Isaacman in his Tuesday evening announcement of the re-nomination on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,\" Trump posted. \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman thanked the president and the \"space-loving community\" Tuesday in a post on X, writing: \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been serving as interim NASA administrator. The president on Tuesday praised Duffy for doing an \"incredible job.\"",
      "The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved Isaacman's nomination in late April and a vote by the full Senate had been expected when Mr. Trump announced he was yanking the nomination.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 09:52:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Researcher Matthew Graham said scientists didn't initially \"believe the numbers about the energy\" emitting from the cosmic display.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have spotted the brightest flare yet from a supermassive black hole that shines with the light of 10 trillion suns.",
      "These bursts of light and energy can come from things like tangled-up magnetic fields or hiccups in the heated gas disks surrounding black holes. The flares help illuminate researchers' understanding of the black holes within.",
      "The flare came from a supermassive black hole that's 10 billion light years away, making the flash the most distant one observed so far. It hails from a time when the universe was rather young. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "The latest cosmic display was spotted in 2018 by a camera at the Palomar Observatory in California. It took about three months to shine at peak brightness and has been decaying in the years since.",
      "It likely happened because a large star wandered too close to the black hole and got shredded to pieces.",
      "\"At first, we didn't really believe the numbers about the energy,\" said study author Matthew Graham with the California Institute of Technology, which operates Palomar.",
      "The new findings were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "Almost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center. The immense pull of that black hole, which is surrounded by powerful magnetic fields, gives the Milky Way its characteristic swirl.",
      "Scientists still aren't sure how supermassive black holes form.",
      "Studying such behemoths can help researchers better understand the stellar neighborhood surrounding supermassive black holes. The discovery also allows scientists \"to probe the interaction of supermassive black holes with their environments early in the universe,\" said Joseph Michail with Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which didn't have a role in the new study. Those early interactions created the cosmos humans now call home.",
      "The oldest black hole yet discovered was spotted by scientists in March 2024. That supermassive black hole was formed when our 13.8 billion-year-old universe was just 430 million years old. The black hole is at the center of a distant galaxy and is vigorously growing, researchers said.",
      "Another ancient supermassive black hole was discovered\u00a0by NASA researchers in 2023. That one was formed about 13.2 billion years ago, making it about 40 million years older than the one found in 2024. It is about 10 times bigger than the Milky Way's black hole.",
      "Meanwhile, the nearest supermassive black hole is just about 1,600 light-years from Earth and is about 10 times the size of the sun.",

The replacement crew includes China's youngest-ever taikonaut \u2014 as China's space program calls its astronauts \u2014   and, for the first time since Beijing launched its program, it will also include live mammals.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 and its crew blasted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China atop a Long March-2F rocket just before midnight on Friday, or about 11 a.m. Eastern.",
      "The taikonauts on board \u2014 Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang \u2014 will rotate in so the trio currently on board the Chinese space station from the Shenzhou-20 mission, which launched on April 24, can come back home after their six-months in space. The exact date of their return has yet to be announced.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew are scheduled to conduct a total of 27 scientific and applied research projects during their mission, focusing on multiple fields including space life sciences, biotechnology, space medicine, space materials science, microgravity fluid physics and combustion and new space technologies, according to information provided by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).",
      "Along with the taikonauts, Shenzhou-21 is carrying four mice \u2014 two females and two males \u2014 the first live mammals ever carried by China into space. Two previous missions to the Tiangong station carried live fish.",
      "The taikonauts will study the effects of microgravity and confined space conditions on the behavioral patterns of mice.",
      "The Shenzhou-21 crew, with Lu as their commander are scheduled to live aboard the space station for approximately six months, just like the crew they are replacing.",
      "It won't be the first visit to the station for Lu, who previously served on the Shenzhou-15 mission.",
      "The other two crew members are making their first spaceflight, and Flight Engineer Wu, born in 1993, will be the youngest taikonaut ever sent into space by his nation.",
      "\"I feel incomparably lucky,\" he told reporters Thursday. \"Being able to integrate my personal dreams into the glorious journey of China's space program is the greatest fortune this era has bestowed upon me.\"",
      "Crowds gathered around the Jiuquan launch site on Friday ahead of the countdown, and a man who identified himself to CBS News only as Mr. Zhao said he was \"very excited\" to be there with his 7-year-old son, \"hoping to plant the seed of a space dream into his heart.\"",
      "China's growing \"space dream\"",
      "China has ramped up its space program unilaterally since being excluded from the International Space Station project \u2014   largely over the U.S. government's concerns about the Chinese military's full control over its program \u2014   to achieve its \"space dream\" under President Xi Jinping.",
      "It has manned the Tiangong station since 2021, and there are now plans to bring the first non-Chinese crewmember aboard the facility.",
      "China will arrange for one Pakistani national to undertake a short-term space mission in the future, the CMSA has said, following the signing of a cooperation agreement between the two countries in February.",
      "The process to select a Pakistani national for training has already begun, along with planning for training programs and to prepare logistical support for Pakistanis under consideration.",
      "Following the selection process, two Pakistani nationals will travel to China to train alongside Chinese taikonauts for future missions, the CMSA said.",
      "CMSA spokesperson Zhang Jingbo said during a news conference this week ahead of the Shenzhou-21 launch that China would welcome international partners to participate in missions aboard its space station.",
      "The work done on China's space station coincides with and often compliments the nation's efforts to be the first nation to land a person on the moon's surface in more than 40 years. Chinese officials have made it a public goal to land taikonauts on the moon's surface by 2030, and eventually to build a lunar base.",
      "China has already landed unmanned probes on the moon, including the first ever to land and collect samples from the celestial body's far side just last year.",
      "\"Overall, the research and construction has been running smoothly, with China aiming to achieve the goal of landing Chinese astronauts on the moon before 2030,\" Zhang said this week ahead of the looming Shenzhou launch, indicating that the CMSA remains on track to meet its lunar goals.",

    "story": [
      "At least seven people were killed and several others injured after a UPS plane crashed shortly after takeoff near the Louisville International Airport on Tuesday, officials said.",
      "The number of fatalities is expected to increase, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear wrote on social media Tuesday night. At least 11 people were injured, officials said earlier.",
      "Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg confirmed at a news conference Tuesday night that at least four people had been killed on the ground.",
      "UPS Flight 2976 crashed around 5:15 p.m. local time after it departed from the Louisville airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The aircraft was headed to Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu, Hawaii, when it went down three miles south of the airfield, Louisville airport public safety officer Jonathan Biven said at a news conference.",
      "Beshear said there was no hazardous cargo onboard the plane that would create environmental issues around the crash site, but urged residents to follow any shelter-in-place orders.",
      "The Louisville Metro Police Department described the scene as active with \"fire and debris,\" warning residents to stay away from Fern Valley and Grade Lane, an intersection located on the south side of the airport, which serves as the hub of UPS. More than 100 firefighters responded to the crash and were still battling hot spots as of Tuesday night, Greenberg said. Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill noted the fire was \"almost entirely contained.\"",
      "O'Neill said the fire had been extinguished enough to allow a formal grid search for any possible victims in the area.",
      "Videos of the crash showed the aircraft partially on fire as it sped down the runway before it burst into flames.",
      "A shelter-in-place order has been reduced to a one-mile radius of the crash site, authorities said. The police department also urged those in the area to turn off any air intake systems as soon as possible due to the smoke in the area.",
      "\"Anybody who has seen the images and the video knows how violent this crash is, and there are a lot of families that are gonna be waiting and wondering for a period of time. We're going to try to get them that information as fast as we can,\" Beshear said.",
      "UPS said in a statement that it was notified of an incident involving one of its aircraft. Three UPS crewmembers were on board, the company said. It didn't immediately provide more details.",
      "\"We do not at the moment have the status of the crew,\" Beshear said. \"Watching that video, I think we're all very, very worried about them.\"",
      "Businesses in the area were heavily impacted by the crash, including Kentucky Petroleum Recycling and Grade A Auto Parts, the governor said.",
      "All arriving and departing flights at the Louisville airport were temporarily suspended. The airport will remain closed Tuesday night, but is expected to reopen Wednesday morning, Greenberg said.",
      "According to preliminary flight data from FlightRadar24, the plane appeared to hit 175 feet in altitude briefly after takeoff. It would have been full of fuel for the flight to Hawaii, which likely led to the significant fire as seen from CBS affiliate WLKY-TV's chopper.",
      "The three-engine McDonnell Douglas MD-11 was manufactured in 1991, according to FAA data.",
      "It was carrying approximately 38,000 gallons of fuel, which weighs about 233,000 pounds, Louisville Fire Chief Brian O'Neill said. The area affected by the crash is about a city block wide, he said, but it has been difficult to contain the fire due to surrounding hazardous materials.",
      "Greenberg urged any residents who find debris on their property not to touch it, and instead report it through a website that should be live by Wednesday.",
      "The crash is where UPS Worldport, an international air hub for the parcel service, is located. UPS said it was halting package sorting operations at Worldport on Tuesday night.",
      "\"This is a UPS town,\" Louisville Metro Councilwoman Betsy Ruhe, whose district is part of the crash site, said during the news conference Tuesday night. \"We all know somebody who works at UPS, and they're all texting their friends, their family, trying to make sure everyone is safe. Sadly, some of those texts are probably going to go unanswered.\"",
      "The 5.2 million-square-foot facility processes more than 400,000 packages an hour and is home to 20,000 UPS workers and 300 daily flights, according to the company.",
      "\"My team and I are closely monitoring the plane crash near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport,\" Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said. \"We continue to pray for the safety of the aircrew, everyone in the area, and for the first-responders on the scene.\"",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board will lead the investigation into the crash. A team of 28 investigators is expected to arrive Wednesday, Greenberg said.",
      "All public schools in the Jefferson County School District, the largest school district in Kentucky with a little under 100,000 students, will be closed Wednesday, Greenberg said.",

      "\"Much ink will be spilled over Mamdani, and he will become a face to the party, but the idea that he will define what it means to be a Democrat, I think, is absurd,\" Bennett said.",
      "Some in the Democratic Party who have been critical of Mamdani rallied behind Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor of New York, who ran as an independent after his defeat by Mamdani in the Democratic primary. Cuomo, the son of liberal icon and former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, was endorsed by the current scandal-ridden New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped his reelection bid, and President Trump.",
      "In the 2024 primary elections, \"mainstream\" Democrats outperformed progressive candidates, winning about two-thirds of the races, according to a study from the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank. The study also noted just three House candidates and one Senate candidate who identify as democratic socialists won their elections in 2024.",
      "A CBS News poll conducted last week found that just 22% of Democrats nationwide think the party should move toward socialist positions. A majority \u2014 60% of Democrats nationwide \u2014 said their party's economic positions should reflect a mixture of socialist and capitalist ideas. And 5% said the party should move more toward capitalist positions.",
      "Establishment Democratic leaders have mostly offered tepid endorsements of Mamdani, or none at all, and moderate Democrats have been trying to distance themselves from his proposals.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, was slow to endorse Mamdani, offering his backing to the candidate in late October, only a day before early voting began. Neither of the state's Democratic senators, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, gave their endorsement. Former President Barack Obama called Mamdani the weekend before the election, but he stopped short of offering public support.",
      "Jeffries told CNN in an interview Sunday that he does not view Mamdani as the future of the party and is not concerned about Republicans using him as a \"lightning rod\" against Democrats in the elections next November.",
      "That won't stop Republicans from asserting that Mamdani is the new face of the Democratic Party. They're doing it already. The National Republican Campaign Committee, the House GOP's fundraising arm, has been linking Mamdani to vulnerable Democrats in New York, as well as party leaders.",
      "\"The Democrat Party has surrendered to radical socialist Zohran Mamdani and the far-left mob who are now running the show,\" NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement Tuesday. \"Every House Democrat is foolishly complicit in their party's collapse, and voters will make them pay in 2026.\"",
      "Bennett said Mamdani's win and the Democratic Socialists of America platform gives Republicans \"a pretty potent set of weapons\" to use against Democrats running in Republican strongholds and battleground states or districts. He compared it to Republican attack ads against Democrats during the \"defund the police\" movement which gained prominence after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police.",
      "\"It raises the level of difficulty to flip places from red to blue,\" Bennett said. \"What we have learned, and we especially learned from the 'defund the police' experience, is that silence is deadly. So Democrats cannot simply presume that their reputation, their brand, the fact that they are local in Wisconsin or Michigan or wherever they're running is going to be enough to convince people that they don't share the Mamdani ideas the Republicans suggest that they do.\"",
      "Also unclear: Whether New York Democrats will help or hinder Mamdani as he tries to implement his far-reaching agenda. He'll need authorization from New York state agencies for proposals like free bus service, and Democrats in Albany will need to greenlight some of the tax increases on high earners that he's proposed in order to pay for his plans.",
      "\"While there is some low-hanging fruit, we believe that many initiatives are not viable in their current form,\" J.P. Morgan Asset Management said in a report on Mamdani's platform last month that argued state lawmakers are unlikely to let him hike taxes on corporations and residents who make over $1 million.",
      "Still, Bennett said there are lessons that Democratic candidates can learn from Mamdani, the most important being his \"crystal clear\" focus on affordability.",
      "\"I don't particularly like his ideas, but he articulated them in ways that really resonated and that people could kind of repeat back to him, and that's a very good lesson for Democrats to take,\" he said.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who also describes himself as a democratic socialist, told CBS News' \"The Takeout\": \"If he wins, the message goes all over this country: You can stand up to the oligarchs, we can start electing members of Congress and mayors and governors who stand with the working class.\"",

    "story": [
      "Zohran Mamdani will be New York City's 111th mayor, CBS News projects, capping a closely watched campaign in which the little-known state assemblyman energized voters with his focus on making America's largest city more affordable.",
      "The 34-year-old democratic socialist defeated Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent after losing a Democratic primary that he had initially entered as the clear front-runner. The mayoral race drew the attention of President Trump, who endorsed Cuomo the night before the election and threatened to withhold federal funds to New York City under a Mayor Mamdani.",
      "Mamdani's message centered around the cost of living, energizing a coalition of young and progressive voters, even as critics questioned his lack of experience and raised concerns about his stance on Israel. He pledged to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments and raise taxes on the wealthy to pay for a host of new services, like free buses and city-run grocery stores.",
      "When he assumes office, Mamdani will make history as the city's first Muslim mayor. At 34, he'll also be one of the city's youngest mayors, but not the youngest ever: That distinction belongs to Hugh J. Grant, who was 31 when he was elected to his first term in 1889.",
      "Click here for complete New York City election results.",
      "Mamdani's background",
      "Mamdani was born in Uganda and moved to New York City when he was 7. He attended the elite Bronx High School of Science before heading off to Bowdoin College.",
      "In 2018, he became an American citizen.",
      "His parents are political science professor Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair. Mamdani is married to artist Rama Duawaji. They live in Queens, where Mamdani has served as state assemblyman since 2021, representing Astoria, Astoria Heights and Ditmars-Steinway in Queens.",
      "Mamdani's policies",
      "Mamdani focused his campaign around reducing the cost of living. He promised to freeze the rent for\u00a0the city's rent-stabilized units. He has also pledged to provide\u00a0free bus service\u00a0and to open city-owned grocery stores in each borough. Mamdani also says he wants to build 200,000 affordable housing units.",
      "To pay for his proposals, Mamdani has said he would raise taxes on corporations and on top earners by 2%, but he'll need the help of Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state legislature to do it.",
      "His candidacy was enthusiastically embraced by prominent fellow progressives like\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders\u00a0and\u00a0Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He eventually got the endorsement of some top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Gov. Kathy Hochul.",
      "Mamdani's position on Israel\u00a0drew scrutiny over the course of the campaign. He condemned\u00a0the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attacks\u00a0on Israel, but also criticized the Israeli government's response, calling the war in Gaza a genocide. Israel said his comments were \"shameful.\"",
      "Mamdani says, while he supports Israel's right to exist,\u00a0he will not say it should exist as a Jewish state.",
      "\"I would not recognize any state's right to exist with a system of hierarchy on the basis of race or religion,\" he said in the candidates' second and final debate.",
      "He also said critics have wrongly accused him of more extreme statements.",
      "\"I have never, not once, spoken in support of global jihad. That is not something that I have said. And that continues to be ascribed to me. And frankly, I think much of it has to do with that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election,\" Mamdani said during the last debate.",
      "Mamdani and the NYPD",
      "Mamdani came under withering criticism for his past remarks regarding the NYPD. He previously called for disbanding the Strategic Response Group, which was the same unit that responded to the Midtown office shooting in July. He has since walked that back, saying he was opposed to using that unit to respond to protests.",
      "\"I am not defunding the police,\" Mamdani said\u00a0this summer. \"I am not running to defund the police.\"",
      "In an\u00a0October interview with Fox News, Mamdani again apologized for remarks he made about the NYPD in 2020, when he called the department \"racist\" and a \"threat to public safety\" amid nationwide protests after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "\"We used to ask officers to focus on serious crimes. Now we're asking them to focus also on the mental health crisis, to focus also on homelessness,\" Mamdani said last month. \"Absolutely I'll apologize to police officers right here. Because this is the apology that I've been sharing with many rank and file officers. And I apologize because of the fact that I'm looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day.\"",
      "Mamdani also recently said he would ask Jessica Tisch to stay on as police commissioner.",

    "story": [
      "Horse Cave, Kentucky \u2014 The comeback story of the small southern Kentucky town of Horse Cave began far below its streets in the Hidden River Cave, which for decades wasn't the place of wonder it is now, but a waste dump.",
      "\"Everybody was sick of the smell,\" former Horse Cave Mayor Sandra Wilson told CBS News.",
      "Wilson remembers when the cave was part of the sewer system. And yet, surprising as it may seem, her desire to modernize the sewer system's infrastructure and clean up the Hidden River Cave was met with fierce resistance.",
      "\"We had a lot of people who were wary of rising sewer prices,\" Wilson said. \"The goal was to create the sewer system to clean up the mess. Period.\"",
      "While the people in town fought over sewers, David Foster of the American Cave Conservation Association had a solution that involved convincing the people of Horse Cave to enact new sewer fees to pay for the cleanup. That was not an easy sell, and caused arguments and threats inside city leadership.",
      "\"It happened over 40 years,\" Foster said of the process to complete the new system. \"It wasn't an overnight success story.\"",
      "Putting in a modern sewer system in 1989 allowed the town to open Hidden River Cave to visitors. Building the stairs, trails and a museum cost an additional $6 million, which came from grants and donations. The museum opened in 1993, and tourists could start exploring all the way into the cave's domes in 2020.",
      "But the investment paid off. Last year, 30,000 tourists came to the town of about 3,000.",
      "Today, 10 miles of passageways are open to visitors. The most unique stretch of Hidden River Cave is also the shakiest part, a 100-foot-long suspension bridge, the longest underground suspension bridge in the world.",
      "\"We draw people off the interstate \u2014 that is really close by \u2014 to come here. And everybody loves the tour,\" Wilson said.",
      "Completion of the sewer system also allowed modern factories to open in the area. There are factories near Horse Cave that employ a combined 3,000 workers.",
      "Foster says that without \"patience and determination,\" the town's biggest stinker would never have become its biggest treasure.",

      "Spanberger will be Virginia's first female governor.",
      "Virginia's off-year gubernatorial race tends to serve as a referendum on the president who was elected a year prior \u2014 and historically, the president's party has almost always lost.",
      "National politics were a throughline in this year's race, especially the Trump administration's sweeping federal layoffs and the still-unresolved month-long government shutdown, which has forced most federal workers to go without pay. Both issues are potent in Virginia, which has nearly 150,000 federal civilian jobs and is home to scores of military personnel.",
      "Spanberger, a former CIA officer and congresswoman, positioned herself as an adversary of the Trump administration and sought to link Earle-Sears to Mr. Trump. She frequently tried to capitalize on frustration over federal layoffs and Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "Virginia has moved leftward in recent years, driven by shifts in the fast-growing suburbs of Washington, D.C., though Democrats lost ground last year, with Mr. Trump boosting his share of the statewide vote from 44% in 2020 to 46.1% in 2024.",
      "A year later, however, the president's approval rating in Virginia stands at 42%, with 55% disapproving, according to exit poll data \u2014 a possible liability for Republicans.",
      "But the race also follows months of uncertainty for the Democratic Party, which was stung by its 2024 loss and is still riven by disagreements between its moderate and progressive factions on the party's strategy moving forward. Meanwhile, just 34% of U.S. adults hold a favorable view of the party, compared to 41% for the GOP, according to a CBS News poll from last month.",
      "Earle-Sears, a Marine Corps veteran and former state lawmaker, took aim at Spanberger over immigration and the participation of transgender students in school sports.",
      "In recent weeks, the race has been dominated by a scandal in the usually lower-profile Virginia attorney general election, after text messages surfaced showing Democratic nominee Jay Jones used violent and incendiary language toward Republicans. Spanberger condemned the messages, but Earle-Sears pressed her to call for Jones to drop out of the race.",
      "Spanberger campaigned in the closing stretch with high-profile Democrats like former President Barack Obama, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.",
      "Earle-Sears drew on support from Virginia's popular but term-limited incumbent Gov. Glenn Youngkin, whose economic record Earle-Sears has touted.",
      "But the Republican candidate wasn't explicitly endorsed by Mr. Trump, the leader of her party, even though the president gave his \"complete and total endorsement\" to the GOP nominees in Virginia's attorney general race and New Jersey's gubernatorial race. Mr. Trump has offered some support for Earle-Sears \u2014 but not by name.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down\u00a0on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding. Some 35 days later, it surpassed the record for longest shutdown on record.",
      "Republicans have rejected Democrats' push to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018 and early 2019, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",

House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

      "\"It was me and God every night,\" Ron Dailey, 65, told \"CBS Mornings,\" speaking about how he leaned on his faith while stranded in the sprawling mountain range in harsh conditions and without much sustenance.",
      "Dailey had packed for a half-day hunting trip on Oct. 13 in the Sierra National Forest, which is a dense wilderness area in central California near the city of Fresno, CBS News Los Angeles reported. When he didn't return home as planned, Dailey's family contacted the Fresno County Sheriff's Office and triggered a massive search operation aerially and on land. According to the station, the operation eventually stretched across multiple counties and tasked responders with locating the missing hunter in rugged terrain.",
      "Although Dailey's hunting trip was meant to be brief, a wrong turn, a snowstorm and a broken truck left him alone and trapped in the wilderness, where he ultimately survived for about 20 days.",
      "\"I went down this hill, I'm going, 'Oh God, this ain't good,'\" Dailey said of the moment he initially lost his way in the forest. \"So, I turned around and tried to get out. I couldn't get out.\"",
      "Then a winter storm hit that evening. About two feet of snow had fallen on top of his truck and all around him, Dailey recalled. At that point, the hunter thought, \"Oh man, I'm in trouble,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Then, Dailey's survival instincts kicked in. He had 14 bottles of water and about 900 calories worth of food with him, which he tried to ration for as long as he could. Eventually, the supply ran out, and Dailey said he \"didn't know if rescue was gonna come\" because \"nobody really knew where I was.\"",
      "When he was finally rescued, Dailey said: \"God woke me up at 6:45 Saturday morning. He goes, 'Ron, get your boots on. Let's go walking.'\"",
      "He walked what he thought was about 10 or 12 miles through the wilderness, stopping frequently to sit down because of the altitude. That's when three rescuers appeared.",
      "\"The Christian community just pulled together and kept praying and praying and praying,\" said Dailey. \"They wouldn't let me die. Neither would God.\"",

    "story": [
      "Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a force in Republican politics for over 30 years and one of the most powerful people to hold the second-highest office in the U.S., has died. He was 84.",
      "In\u00a0a statement, Cheney's family said he died Monday night of complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, surrounded by his wife of 61 years, Lynne, daughters Liz and Mary and other family members.",
      "Before becoming vice president in the George W. Bush administration, Cheney served as defense secretary, White House chief of staff and a Wyoming congressman.",
      "In the statement, his family called Cheney \"a great and good man who taught his children and grandchildren to love our country, and to live lives of courage, honor, love, kindness, and fly fishing. We are grateful beyond measure to have loved and been loved by this noble giant of a man.\"",
      "In 2000, Cheney was asked by Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, to help pick his running mate. In the end, it was Cheney's own name that topped the list. He would, it was believed, provide gravitas and broad Washington experience for the younger Texas governor.",
      "\"He really wanted me to come on board because he thought I could help govern, be part of his team, and that he wanted me involved in everything,\" Cheney told CBS' \"60 Minutes II.\"",
      "He was viewed as one of the most powerful vice presidents in U.S. history; at the same time, he became a lightning rod for those who opposed the war in Iraq and the expansion of presidential powers.",
      "\"Cheney really drastically changed the presidency, the vice president's role and our standing in the international community,\" presidential historian Alexis Coe told CBS News.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, Bush called Cheney a \"calm and steady presence in the White House amid great national challenges.\"",
      "\"I counted on him for his honest, forthright counsel, and he never failed to give his best,\" Bush said. \"He held to his convictions and prioritized the freedom and security of the American people. For those two terms in office, and throughout his remarkable career, Dick Cheney's service always reflected credit on the country he loved.\"",
      "In recent years, Cheney saw his daughter Liz Cheney achieve political prominence as a Wyoming GOP representative in Congress known for her open criticism of President Trump. She lost her position as the top Republican woman in the House over her fight with Mr. Trump about his baseless claims that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. She went on to serve as vice chair of the House select committee investigating the assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and continued to warn of the danger that she said Mr. Trump posed to democracy, even campaigning for his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, in 2024.",
      "Dick Cheney cut an ad for his daughter's failed 2022 reelection campaign backing her position, arguing that in U.S. history \"there has never been an individual that was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump.\"",
      "Cheney shaped Republican Party politics for a generation, but he cast his final presidential ballot in 2024 for a Democrat. In a statement, he said Mr. Trump \"can never be trusted with power again. As citizens, we each have a duty to put country above partisanship to defend our Constitution.\"",
      "Early life and rise to power",
      "Richard Bruce Cheney was born in 1941 in Lincoln, Nebraska, and grew up in Wyoming. He attended Yale but dropped out after two years and instead finished his college education at the University of Wyoming. Cheney married his high-school sweetheart Lynne, with whom he had two daughters.",
      "He then moved to Washington, D.C., to begin his career, having avoided the draft and the Vietnam War with deferments beginning in early 1966 because it took him six years to finish college, he later testified before Congress at a confirmation hearing.",
      "By age 34, he was White House chief of staff for President Gerald Ford, the youngest person ever to hold the job.",
      "In 1978, he ran for Congress and won the first of six terms in the House, representing Wyoming. In 1989, he was chosen to be secretary of defense in the administration of President George H.W. Bush.",
      "In 1991, he oversaw the U.S. victory in the first Gulf War, when Iraqi forces were driven out of Kuwait. For years afterward, he defended the decision not to invade Baghdad.",
      "\"If we had gone on to Baghdad, if we had sort of accepted the responsibility for occupying the country, governing Iraq, putting a new government in place, running Saddam to ground, I think there would have been significant additional U.S. casualties,\" Cheney said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" in 1992. \"I can't say how many, but the proposition is how many additional American lives is Saddam Hussein worth? And my answer to that question is, not very darn many.\"",
      "In 1995, Cheney became chairman and CEO of Halliburton, the world's largest oil field services company, his first corporate job. His salary and stock options made him a multimillionaire. But in 2000 he left the company to join the Republican ticket.",
      "\"This election is about real choices \u2014 we are talking about the future of our nation,\" Cheney said at a 2000 post-debate rally in Kentucky.",
      "The presidential campaign was bitterly contested and its outcome was undecided on election night, with Florida too close to call, though Bush had a slight lead. Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, asked for recounts in four counties, as Bush sued to stop the recounts. The race was ultimately decided five weeks after the election by a 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court.",
      "A turning point in history",
      "The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States proved to be the defining moment for the new administration \u2014 particularly, it seemed, for Cheney. Even as the U.S. struck al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan, Cheney warned of a larger web of U.S. enemies, urging military action against Iraq and Saddam Hussein.",
      "\"Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,\" Cheney told the Veterans of Foreign Wars in 2002.",
      "Baghdad fell only three weeks after the U.S. invasion in 2003. No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, and American forces began a long, deadly occupation.",
      "\"It's hard to explain how important he was, actually, during those Iraq war days,\" Republican strategist Kevin Sheridan told CBS News. \"He was truly central to everything that America did to respond to 9/11. He's obviously received a lot of criticism since for it.\"",
      "Even so, the Bush-Cheney team made national security the centerpiece of the 2004 presidential campaign.",
      "\"If we make the wrong choice, the danger is that we'll get hit again,\" Cheney said at a town hall meeting in Des Moines, Iowa.",
      "The president and Cheney were returned to office in a close election.",
      "But as the situation in Iraq disintegrated and U.S. casualties mounted, public opinion turned against the conflict and the administration.",
      "In November 2006, Democrats won majorities in both houses of Congress, swept in primarily by anti-war sentiment.",
      "To his many detractors, Cheney was a man obsessed with secrecy, the threat of terrorism and strengthening presidential power.",
      "Cheney and Bush ignored the critics.",
      "But in his second term, the president broke with Cheney on the firing of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, the offer of talks to North Korea, and the refusal of a pardon for Cheney's former chief of staff, Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby. Libby was convicted in 2007 of lying to a grand jury but ultimately pardoned by President Trump in 2018.",
      "At the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama, Cheney appeared in a wheelchair because of a back injury. But the former vice president proved to be as pugnacious as ever in frequent attacks on the new president and his administration. \"I think Barack Obama is a one-term president,\" Cheney said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2010.",
      "Heart transplant brings \"a new day\"",
      "Cheney's cardiovascular health was a problem throughout his life. He suffered a total of five heart attacks, his first at age 37 during his run for Congress.",
      "In 2010, after his fifth, doctors implanted a battery-powered device to help his heart pump blood throughout his body. That bought Cheney time while he awaited a heart transplant, which he received in 2012.",
      "\"You wake up every morning with a smile on your face,\" he told 60 Minutes\u00a0in 2013, \"because you've got a new day you never expected to have.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Nov 2025 19:25:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the agency may need to close \"certain parts\" of the nation's airspace if the shutdown drags on.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation may need to close \"certain parts of the airspace\" if the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0on record continues into next week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" Duffy said at a press conference in Washington, D.C. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "He added, \"We will restrict the airspace when we feel it's not safe.\"",
      "Throughout the 35-day federal shutdown, set to become the longest in U.S. history, Duffy has maintained that commercial air travel remains safe. The tradeoff is that passengers are experiencing more flight delays as officials slow flight traffic based on staffing levels to ensure that the national airspace remains well-monitored, Duffy\u00a0has said at earlier press conferences.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while an additional 4,700 trips were delayed on Monday, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "Duffy said on social media on Wednesday that 46% of the previous day's flight delays were due to staffing issues in air traffic control towers. Ordinarily, personnel issues account for roughly 5% of such delays, according to aviation data.",
      "\"Draconian steps\"?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights following the\u00a09/11 terror attacks for national security reasons, while hurricanes and other weather emergencies can also lead to flight restrictions. But closing parts of the nation's airspace because of staffing issues would be unprecedented, according to aviation industry experts.",
      "\"In this particular instance, Duffy is talking about staffing. He knows the strain and stress this is taking on air traffic controllers,\" Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and an expert on aviation security, told CBS News.",
      "Closing even a portion of the nation's vast airspace would be a major step and likely impact travel nationwide, he added. The system operates on a so-called hub-and-spoke model in which passengers using regional airports can connect with major airports to travel around the U.S.",
      "If the airspace around New York were to close, for example, it could affect passengers in multiple cities, according to Jacobson.",
      "\"For us to take such draconian steps to shut it down in sectors of the country would be unprecedented,\" he said. \"If you shut down the New York area, you shut down a lot of the country because of the interconnectivity of the hub-and-spoke system.\"",
      "More controllers calling in sick",
      "With air traffic controllers working without pay during the shutdown, more than usual are calling in sick, Duffy has said. He has said he is discouraging them from taking on side gigs like delivering for Uber or DoorDash to make ends meet during the funding lapse, given the level of focus that their job requires.",
      "\"The longer this goes on, every day, these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, and they're being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said Tuesday. \"As every day goes by, I think the problem is going to only get worse. Not better.\"",
      "At an Oct. 28 news conference at LaGuardia Airport in New York, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels emphasized that his organization's members are under mounting financial pressures.",
      "\"Air traffic controllers have to have 100% of focus 100% of the time,\" he said. \"And I'm watching air traffic controllers going to work. I'm getting the stories. They're worried about paying for medicine for their daughter. I got a message from a controller that said, 'I'm running out of money. And if she doesn't get the medicine she needs, she dies. That's the end.'\"",
      "The U.S. Travel Association on Monday urged congressional leaders to end the shutdown, which the industry trade group said could disrupt passengers during the busy Thanksgiving holiday. In 2024, 20 million passengers took to the skies over that week.",
      "\"A shutdown places extraordinary strain on federal personnel who are essential to keeping America moving \u2014 from Transportation Security Administration officers to air traffic controllers, who are forced to work without pay,\" the group said in a Nov. 3 letter. \"When staffing shortages worsen, airport wait times grow longer and flight delays and cancellations become more frequent, threatening to derail family travel plans across the country.\"",

      "A plan announced Monday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide partial\u00a0food stamp benefits for November during the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could offer a measure of relief to millions of Americans. Yet the move still leaves participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the dark on exactly when they will get the funds.",
      "In a\u00a0declaration\u00a0submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said $4.6 billion in contingency USDA funds will be used to cover 50% of SNAP recipients' benefits.",
      "However, the USDA declaration said that procedural changes U.S. states must make in order to issue partial benefits could take \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months.\" A spokesperson for the USDA referred CBS News to a social media\u00a0post\u00a0from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, which also says benefits could take several weeks to arrive.",
      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue SNAP payments since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.",
      "\"I would hope that states will move heaven and Earth to get SNAP benefits flowing as quickly as possible,\" she said.",
      "The White House referred CBS News to the Office of Management and Budget, which also did not respond to a request for comment.",

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified at a press conference later in the day that Mr. Trump was referring to future SNAP payments.",
      "\"He does not want to have to keep tapping into an emergency fund and depleting it in the case of a catastrophe in this country,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Senators are discussing a deal that would fund the government alongside long-term appropriations bills in exchange for a vote on extending health care tax credits.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The contours of a potential deal to reopen the government began to emerge on Tuesday as the shutdown was poised to become the longest in history, with senators discussing an agreement that would fund the government alongside long-term appropriations bills in exchange for a vote on extending health insurance tax credits that Democrats have demanded.",
      "A bipartisan group of senators has been engaged in conversations in recent days as lawmakers search for an off-ramp in the shutdown fight. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Tuesday morning that he's hopeful the bipartisan group is close to a solution, while acknowledging the \"cross-pressures that everybody's feeling\" are \"great.\"",
      "Republicans argue that Democrats are waiting until after Tuesday's elections to back down, claiming they don't want to discourage their base from turning out to vote. A 14th vote on advancing the GOP-backed continuing resolution failed on Tuesday, with no new Democrats crossing the aisle.",
      "Senate Democrats were tight-lipped about a potential deal after a lengthy lunch meeting at the Capitol. \"We had a very good caucus, and we're exploring all the options,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, told reporters that he's \"pretty confident\" the shutdown will end this week: \"I will tell you there's enough Democrats that I'm friends with that were willing to vote last week, and they were assured that Schumer would let them vote the way they need to this week.\"",
      "The bipartisan conversations on Capitol Hill revolve around an effort to move forward on a so-called \"minibus,\" or a package of full-year appropriations bills, in addition to the continuing resolution. Proponents of the plan say that approving the package would demonstrate Republicans' willingness to work on the long-term funding process on a bipartisan basis.",
      "The minibus would include three separate bills. One would fund military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The second would include funding for the legislative branch, and the third would fund the FDA and the Department of Agriculture. Thune told reporters that the continuing resolution to reopen the government could \"ride\" on the appropriations package.",
      "Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican and appropriator, told reporters on Tuesday that she made calls on the issue through the weekend. She said she's hopeful that a package of appropriations bills can be part of what ends the stalemate.",
      "\"The reason we're in this position is that we have not passed appropriations bills,\" Britt said. \"So beginning to break the logjam through doing that, I think, would be incredibly effective.\"",
      "Still, Republicans need to win over at least five more Democrats to reopen the government with a short-term measure. Republicans have said they are willing to guarantee a vote on extending health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act in exchange for Democrats' votes, an offer that has been on the table for weeks. Some GOP senators think enough Democrats may be now willing to \"take yes for an answer,\" as Thune puts it.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who is involved in the talks, outlined the thinking to reporters Tuesday. He said that the appropriations package might entice Democrats to \"vote for something other than just simply a continuing resolution\" while providing \"a path forward\" beyond a vote on the health care tax credits.",
      "Republicans have emphasized a return to regular order in this year's appropriations process and have worked to pass all 12 full-year funding bills, as opposed to a massive year-end funding bill. Appropriators are still aiming to accomplish that goal and avoid a year-long continuing resolution or an omnibus package.",
      "But the continuing resolution would only fund the government until Nov. 21, giving appropriators little time to finish full-year funding. Thune has acknowledged that the deadline must be pushed back, though the exact timing remains up in the air.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the top appropriator in the upper chamber, advocated on Monday for a December date. Some lawmakers have argued that a December deadline would increase the chances of resolving the funding fight through individual bills while avoiding a full-year stopgap measure.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson ruled out a December continuing resolution on Tuesday morning, saying \"too many people have concerns\" about a pre-holiday deadline that often results in massive omnibus legislation to fund the government. Thune said later in the day that the date is still being discussed, noting that the expectation is that lawmakers will fund the government through the normal appropriations process. He said nobody wants a year-long continuing resolution, which would extend funding at current levels.",
      "Generally, senators said the talks about an off-ramp were more productive, though they were slim on the details. Sen. Gary Peters, a Michigan Democrat who's been involved in the conversations, said it was a \"sensitive time\" in the talks.",
      "Collins told reporters Monday that \"we are finally making progress\" in the bipartisan conversations, saying she was \"cautiously hopeful\" that the shutdown will be resolved by the end of the week. On Tuesday, she said \"the talks are more productive because they're more specific.\"",
      "Thune said he's hopeful that \"we'll make some progress\" this week. But any one senator could opt to slow down the process, potentially pushing the impasse into next week.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House clarified Tuesday that the Trump administration is complying with a federal court order that requires it to tap into a contingency fund to provide food benefits to tens of millions of Americans after President Trump said the aid from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will go out only when Democrats vote to end the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "The reassurance from the White House came after the president wrote in a\u00a0post on Truth Social\u00a0that SNAP benefits \"will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comment raised questions as to whether the administration would abide by a Rhode Island judge's order to use reserve funds to issue federal food benefits to Americans enrolled in SNAP. Administration lawyers\u00a0told the court\u00a0Monday that it would tap into the contingency pot to issue reduced food stamp payments for November. The Justice Department said in a filing that the Department of Agriculture would provide states with information necessary for calculating the benefits due to each eligible household, which would allow states to then begin disbursements.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said on X that her agency sent that guidance to states Tuesday morning, but warned it would be a \"cumbersome process\" that could result in a weeks-long delay in food stamp payments going out recipients.",
      "\"If the government opens, families get their FULL benefit much more quickly,\" she wrote.",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's comments by CBS News senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration is \"fully complying\" with the court's order, but stressed that \"it's going to take some time\" for recipients to receive the payments.",
      "\"We are digging into a contingency fund that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes, for war, and the president does not want to have to tap into this fund in the future,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt said that in order for beneficiaries to receive their full benefits, Democrats need to vote to fund federal agencies and end the shutdown. Administration officials have said fully covering those allotments for November would require roughly $9 billion, but there is only about $4.6 billion in the contingency fund that can be used to cover this month's benefit payments.",
      "\"Democrats are holding it up and making it difficult for the administration to get those payments out the door,\" she said.",
      "The government shutdown entered its 35th day Tuesday and is on track to become the longest in U.S. history later in the day, surpassing the lapse in federal funding that occurred during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "More than 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to purchase food each month. The program is funded by the federal government and administered by states, which distribute the nutrition assistance to eligible participants. But the Department of Agriculture said late last month that the food aid would not go out to recipients on Nov. 1 because \"the well has run dry\" amid the government shutdown.",
      "The notice followed the Trump administration's decision not to use roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep the benefits flowing to Americans who rely on SNAP for November. The Department of Agriculture told states in a memo last month that the reserve funds were \"not legally available to cover regular benefits.\"",
      "Ahead of the cutoff of food benefits at the start of the month, a group of 25 states and the District of Columbia, and a coalition of municipalities and nonprofit organizations,\u00a0filed two different lawsuits claiming the administration's decision to halt food stamp payments was illegal. They sought court orders requiring the Department of Agriculture to use the contingency fund for this month's benefits.",
      "In one of the cases, U.S. District Judge John McConnell on Friday ordered the Trump administration to dip into the fund to cover the lapse in SNAP payments caused by the shutdown. The judge, who sits in Rhode Island, gave the government until Monday to file a status update about the distribution of the money.",
      "In its filing with McConnell submitted Monday, the Justice Department said the Agriculture Department would comply with his order and \"fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today\" by providing state agencies with information about reduced SNAP payments.",
      "Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said in a declaration that the administration \"intends to deplete SNAP contingency funds completely and provide reduced SNAP benefits for November 2025.\" He told the court there is roughly $4.6 billion in the reserve for the November payments, which would be used to cover half of eligible households' allotments.",
      "But he warned the aid would likely not go out immediately because of possible \"payment errors and significant delays\" due to variations among state eligibility systems, which have to be adjusted for the reduced payments.",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofits and municipalities have\u00a0asked McConnell to issue a new order compelling the Trump administration to provide the full SNAP benefits.",

      "Sean Dunn, who was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault charges, has become a symbol of resistance against Mr. Trump's D.C. policing policies, sat in a crowded courtroom as spectators, jury members, and even witnesses attempted to keep a straight face during the first day of his criminal trial.",
      "\"He did it, he threw the sandwich,\" Dunn's attorney Julia Gatto said in her opening statement to a D.C. jury, adding their client has \"very strong feelings\" about the Trump administration's federal takeover of D.C.",
      "Gatto called the viral sub-toss a \"harmless gesture that did not, could not, cause injury.\"",
      "Customs and Border Patrol Agent Gregory Lairmore, who was hit with the footlong sub, testified Tuesday about his experience dealing with Dunn, who can be seen in video of the incident yelling at the agent and other officers in his vicinity before throwing the wrapped sandwich at the officer's chest. Dunn attempted to flee on foot before being apprehended, documents and video of the incident shows.",
      "According to charging documents, Dunn yelled, \"F*** you! You f***ing fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city,\" before crossing the street. He later returned and threw the sandwich.",

      "To laughs in the room, Lairmore walked the jury through the \"baseball pitch\" of a sub throw, as another witness put it.",
      "Lairmore said he \"could feel it through his ballistic vest\" and it \"exploded all over\" him after the Subway stack hit him. He said he \"could smell the onions and mustard\" on his uniform, and even had an onion string hanging by his police radio later that night. The fast-food mustard, he said, stained his shirt.",
      "Dunn's attorneys later pressed Lairmore on two gag gifts that his coworkers bought him after the incident, including a plush submarine sandwich and a \"felony footlong\" patch that Lairmore said he put on his lunchbox.",
      "They also pressed Lairmore on why there are no evidentiary photos of stains on his shirt or of the sandwich after it was thrown, only a video posted to social media platform Instagram from a bystander showing the sandwich mostly intact. Lairmore said the Metropolitan Police Department in D.C. took over the investigation after Dunn was detained, and Lairmore said the sandwich appeared at least \"bent and out of shape\" in its wrapper.",
      "Federal prosecutors failed to secure a felony indictment\u00a0from a grand jury in Washington in the immediate aftermath of the incident, and instead charged Dunn with a federal misdemeanor assault charge for allegedly assaulting, resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating and interfering with a federal officer.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will consider Wednesday whether a federal emergency powers law gives President Trump the authority to impose his most sweeping tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 For Lindsay Hagerman, the past few months have felt tumultuous.",
      "As the co-owner of the Pennsylvania-based RainCaper, which sells art-inspired travel accessories and gifts, Hagerman has found herself questioning her pricing strategy while watching tariffs on goods imported from China see-saw from 10% to 20% to 145% \u2014 and then back down again.",
      "\"Is it temporary? Is this the new normal? You're struggling with how do we price \u2014 do we change prices now? Wait? I don't want to gouge people,\" Hagerman told CBS News. \"That's not how you do good business. But I also need to cover expenses.\"",
      "RainCaper, which Hagerman founded with her mother nearly a decade ago, sells rain capes, travel accessories, umbrellas, scarves, shawls and drinkware to boutiques, museum stores, retailers and directly to consumers through its website.",
      "Her company imports umbrellas and rain capes made from a waterproof fabric from China, and neither can be made in the U.S., Hagerman said. As a result, RainCaper has found itself on the front lines of President Trump's trade war, which relies heavily on tariffs.",
      "But Hagerman and small business owners across the U.S. could see some stability in the coming weeks, with the Supreme Court set to consider Wednesday whether Mr. Trump has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs on nearly every country under a federal emergency powers law.",
      "Lower courts have ruled his most sweeping duties are illegal, and a decision from the Supreme Court upholding those decisions could deal a blow to the president's efforts to use tariffs as leverage in negotiations with foreign countries and to pressure U.S. companies to invest in domestic manufacturing. But a ruling from the high court against Mr. Trump, who appointed three of the justices, could also have significant implications for presidential power.",
      "Since he announced the sweeping global tariffs earlier this year, many small businesses have had to devote time and resources to keeping up with the fast-changing fluctuations in the tariff rates and countries targeted, all while making determinations about how to respond to the increased costs of importing the components needed for their products.",
      "At RainCaper, Hagerman has trimmed expenses and laid off two of its seven employees who were working in operations and customer service, she said.",
      "She also explored manufacturing outside of China because of the levies, though Hagerman ultimately decided against it in part because of the significant investment it would require. And as a military spouse whose husband is out of state, she said making trips to countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia to look at other potential facilities wasn't possible.",
      "\"When the administration is saying we're bringing trillions into the economy and saying China is paying these tariffs, Brazil is paying these tariffs, it's just not true,\" Hagerman said. \"Tariffs are borne by the importer. I'm the importer.\"",
      "A \"stark choice\" for the Supreme Court",
      "Mr. Trump has invoked a federal law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose two different sets of tariffs through a series of executive orders. The first set a baseline rate of 10% on nearly every U.S. trading partner, as well as higher reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 countries; and the second targeted China, Canada and Mexico with tariffs of varying rates.",
      "In his executive orders, the president declared trade deficits and the flood of fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the U.S. as national emergencies, which unlocked IEEPA's powers. The law authorizes the president to \"regulate \u2026 importation\" to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security, foreign policy or the U.S. economy, which he said trade imbalances and drug trafficking constitute.",
      "Since Mr. Trump announced the tariffs in February and April \u2014 on what he called \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 the administration has reached trade deals with 10 countries and the European Union, and said it is \"actively negotiating\" with more foreign nations.",
      "But soon after the president announced the tariffs, two sets of small businesses and a group of 12 states filed lawsuits arguing that IEEPA doesn't authorize the sweeping duties. Lower courts have ruled against the administration, finding that IEEPA doesn't give the president the power to unilaterally impose the global and trafficking tariffs.",
      "In one of the cases, involving a group of five small businesses and Democratic officials from 12 states, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 7-4 that many of the president's levies are illegal. But the Federal Circuit set aside a lower court's injunction, which has allowed the Trump administration to keep collecting the global and trafficking tariffs for now.",
      "Mr. Trump has also continued to rely on IEEPA to impose new levies or tweak existing rates, including raising Canadian tariffs to 35%, though many of its goods are exempt,\u00a0imposing an additional 40% duty on Brazil and threatening China with an additional 100% duty, though the president has since walked that back. Mr. Trump then announced last week after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping that he would be reducing the tariffs on goods imported from China.",
      "The Trump administration is urging the Supreme Court to uphold the levies, arguing that Congress has long given the president broad authority to impose tariffs to address emergencies. Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing\u00a0that IEEPA is a continuation of that tradition because it gives the president the power to \"regulate \u2026 importation.\"",
      "Sauer also asserted that the tariffs are an exercise of Mr. Trump's power over national security and foreign affairs, and argued courts should give deference to his determination that the duties are best suited for addressing national emergencies arising from trade deficits and drug trafficking.",
      "Invalidating those levies, he said, would have \"catastrophic consequences\" for national security, foreign policy and the economy.",
      "\"To the President, these cases present a stark choice: With tariffs, we are a rich nation; without tariffs, we are a poor nation,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump has called the case \"one of the most important in the history of the country\" and had said he planned to attend the arguments in-person. But he reversed course Sunday, writing on social media that he did \"not want to distract from the importance of this decision.\"",
      "Lawyers for the small businesses told the high court in papers that Mr. Trump's tariffs have significant economic consequences. An analysis from the Tax Foundation found the duties will impose $1.7 trillion in new taxes on Americans by 2035, reduce GDP growth by 0.7% per year, and reduce income by 1.1% in 2026.",
      "No president has used IEEPA to levy tariffs \u2014 until now \u2014 and the law makes no mention of that word or others like it. Neal Katyal, who will argue on behalf of the small businesses before the Supreme Court, warned in filings that the Trump administration's interpretation of IEEPA is a \"breathtaking assertion\" of power that requires explicit authorization from Congress.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with Mr. Trump that the power to tax is found in IEEPA through the phrase \"regulate \u2026 importation,\" then \"the president, empowered by a supercharged U.S. Code, could tax everything from autos to zoos,\" Katyal wrote in a filing.",
      "\"The government's theory is really that the president has the ability to impose sales taxes, property taxes, use taxes, essentially a wealth tax under IEEPA,\" Timothy Meyer, an expert in international law at Duke Law, told CBS News. \"The justices are going to have to confront this really extraordinary breadth of the government's argument.\"",
      "The plaintiffs also argued that trade deficits hardly constitute an \"unusual and extraordinary threat,\" as imbalances have lasted for five decades, and Mr. Trump himself has described them as \"persistent.\"",
      "Additionally, the power to levy taxes and duties rests squarely with Congress, and any delegations of that power have been \"explicit and strictly limited,\" they said. And indeed, there are numerous other statutes in which Congress has delegated its tariffing power \u2014 some of which have been used by Mr. Trump \u2014 though they put constraints on the president.",
      "\"The reason that President Trump likes IEEPA is because unlike every other statute that delegates to the president the authority to impose tariffs, IEEPA requires no process before the president can act, requires no investigation, no fact-finding other than an unreviewable declaration of a national emergency, and it places no limits on what the president can do in terms of the amount of the duty or the length of time that they can remain in place,\" Meyer said.",
      "He continued: \"The reason it doesn't do any of those things is because it doesn't mention duties at all, so it seems pretty likely that Congress did not intend to include substantial power to impose tariffs in the statute.\"",
      "Jeffrey Bialos, a partner at Eversheds Sutherland who specializes in international law, predicted that if Mr. Trump prevails before the Supreme Court, future administrations would likely use IEEPA's authority to set out broad tariffs rather than look to other authorities that are more narrow and impose certain requirements.",
      "\"This isn't foreign affairs. It's a question of what is permissible to delegate under Article I Section 8, and what kind of authority you need,\" Bialos said. \"Did Congress intend to allow the president to throw out the entire tariff code of the United States? That's the import of what was done here.\"",
      "A test of presidential authority",
      "Mr. Trump has spent his first months back in the White House flexing his presidential authority in other ways, including through his firings of executive branch officials and the withholding of $4 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress.",
      "When those cases made their way to the Supreme Court in their early stages, the conservative justices have in most instances allowed the Trump administration to temporarily enforce certain policies while proceedings in the lower courts continue.",
      "In the dispute over Mr. Trump's tariffs, the Supreme Court will weigh the legal merits of the case, something it has not yet done in the others. But the court battle, like those others, could have implications for the power the president is seeking to assert.",
      "\"What the Supreme Court is really deciding here is whether or not to give the administration a free pass any time it's able to connect some sort of policy initiative to some sort of international dimension,\" Meyer said. \"If you create a system in which you get deference if you can characterize something as a foreign affairs issue, but there's no deference if it's done by an administrative agency pursuing some sort of statutory delegation, then the administration will just do as much as it can through emergency and international affairs powers.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been skeptical of broad assertions of executive authority on issues of major political and economic significance when Congress has not spoken clearly, invoking what's called the major questions doctrine to invalidate former President Joe Biden's plan to wipe away more than $400 billion in student loan debt and block an eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "That legal principle is raised in the battle over his tariffs, though the Trump administration argues that it doesn't apply to matters of national security and foreign policy. But lawyers for the small businesses counter that tariffs are a tax on the American people, and the Constitution has vested the taxing power in Congress.",
      "\"Taxing American citizens is not national security or foreign policy, and the tariffs are paid by Emily Ley and other ordinary Americans,\" said Mark Chenoweth, president and chief legal officer at the New Civil Liberties Alliance. The organization is representing a Pensacola-based stationary company and its CEO, Emily Ley, in a different challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs. That case is not before the Supreme Court.",
      "\"To argue that unilateral taxation of American citizens is national security or foreign policy is incorrect,\" Chenoweth said. \"We fought a Revolutionary War over the idea of taxation without representation, and that's what this would be if the president can unilaterally raise taxes on American citizens.\"",
      "A \"mass extinction\" of small businesses",
      "While lower courts have agreed that Mr. Trump's global and trafficking tariffs are illegal, the government has continued to collect the duties as the Supreme Court weighs the cases.",
      "For Julie Robbins, CEO of EarthQuaker Devices, that has meant paying nearly $40,000 in levies through the end of October.",
      "The family-owned company makes guitar pedals and manufactures its products in Akron, Ohio. EarthQuaker's product line includes 50 pedals that require more than 900 unique components that it sources from 15 different countries, including Mexico, Portugal, Poland, Ukraine and several in Asia.",
      "To assist with logistics, Robbins said EarthQuaker works with wholesalers that vet overseas manufacturers and source the mechanical and electrical components needed for its pedals. The wholesalers are paying the tariffs when the items arrive at U.S. ports and then pass along a portion of the duties to EarthQuaker, she said.",
      "Upon hearing Mr. Trump would be imposing his sweeping levies, one of Robbins' first moves was to search for domestic suppliers. She ultimately found they either don't exist for the parts that go into EarthQuaker's guitar pedals or they charge significantly more than her international sources.",
      "Plus, breaking off long-held relationships with overseas suppliers would be risky and disrupt a supply chain that took years to perfect, she said, since there were no guarantees other manufacturers or their products would be reliable.",
      "\"It's taken us 20 years to develop this supply chain,\" she said. \"It's not something that happened overnight and so in order to redo it, I can't see it happening.\"",
      "Robbins said EarthQuaker could save money by having their pedals made in-full overseas, rather than having the parts shipped to the U.S. and the pedals assembled at its production facilities in Ohio. But doing that wouldn't align with the company's values of keeping well-paying jobs in Akron, a city that was once known as the \"Rubber Capital of the World\" for its production of rubber products.",
      "\"When people try to oversimplify and say you should be manufacturing in the United States, we are manufacturing in the United States, but you can't make the raw materials in the U.S.,\" Robbins said.",
      "EarthQuaker doesn't have deep-pocketed investors and has eroded its cash cushion as it has navigated the whiplash of changing tariff rates, she said. The company also opted not to replace employees that have left in recent months, and it pulled two open positions.",
      "\"My concern is there's just going to be this mass extinction of small business,\" Robbins said. \"It's not sustainable.\"",
      "Cephalofair Games, a California-based company that designs and publishes board games, has paid more than $144,000 in new tariffs over the past few months, according to its chief operating officer, Price Johnson.",
      "In July, Cephalofair informed its customers it would be adding \"tariff surcharges\" as a result of the import taxes and has increased the prices of its products. It has also reduced the salaries of staff and furloughed workers.",
      "The company manufactures its games in China and has had to make adjustments to product runs in response to the tariffs. Johnson told CBS News that a run of 7,000 units is nearly completed, but instead of bringing it into the U.S., the company will instead send its games to Europe, the United Kingdom and Australia.",
      "In the meantime, Johnson said the company continues to design and develop new games, but is waiting to hear from the Supreme Court before moving forward with manufacturing.",
      "Cephalofair wasn't impacted by tariffs during the first administration and had been preparing for tariffs on Chinese imports of between 10% and 15%, Johnson said. But these days, he and his colleagues have taken to watching Mr. Trump's social media feed for tariff-related announcements.",
      "The uncertainty has \"removed any ability for us to plan or rely on what we as importers can operate on,\" Johnson said. \"We have to plan on not being able to plan or trust what U.S. policy is surrounding trade.\"",

    "summary": "Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein provided the Justice Department with \"precise and detailed\" information about 20 alleged co-conspirators, House Democrats say.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, is seeking documents from the Justice Department on its move earlier this year to end the investigation into alleged co-conspirators of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"I write to demand an explanation for why DOJ has abandoned the women and girls abused by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators, fired or cut off career prosecutors from the case, and ceased its investigation into one of the largest sex trafficking rings in history,\" Raskin wrote in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, which was first obtained by CBS News.",
      "The demand comes amid relentless bipartisan interest in the investigation, which has dogged the Justice Department's top officials as they've sought to put the matter to rest. Some in the Trump administration, including Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel, promised major revelations into the Epstein matter before taking office, only to indicate later that the case was closed.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on Raskin's letter and will update this story with any response.",
      "In the letter, Raskin said almost 50 survivors provided information to prosecutors and FBI agents as part of the investigation that ultimately led to the indictments of Epstein in 2019 and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2020. Raskin said the information the survivors provided was \"precise and detailed.\"",
      "\"They described how Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell, and their co-conspirators orchestrated a sophisticated and clandestine sex trafficking conspiracy that trafficked them to at least 20 men,\" Raskin said. \"These survivors shared with DOJ and FBI the specific identities of many of these co-conspirators, how this operation was structured and financed, and which individuals facilitated these crimes.\"",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York was running an active investigation into Epstein and Maxwell's co-conspirators until January 2025, when prosecutors were directed to transfer the Epstein case files to the Justice Department's headquarters, in what Raskin said was \"a sudden and dramatic shift in the posture of the investigation.\" Since then, \"the investigation into co-conspirators has inexplicably ceased,\" he said, citing information provided to the Judiciary Committee by attorneys who represent Epstein survivors.",
      "Then in July, the Justice Department issued the findings of an internal review, which it said found no \"client list\" among the evidence collected by investigators. It also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties.\" Bondi suggested during a Fox News interview in February that a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk awaiting her review.",
      "\"DOJ and FBI's failure to investigate this conduct is a betrayal of the more than 1,000 survivors of this multi-billion-dollar international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin wrote. \"As these survivors made clear to DOJ and FBI, Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell did not act alone.\"",
      "Raskin said many of the women spoke with prosecutors and agents, and the interviews were summarized in 302 forms, a document used by the FBI to memorialize information that may later come up in courtroom testimony. Along with the women, Raskin said federal law enforcement agents who worked on the case understood that the investigation was continuing up until January. In Supreme Court filings, Raskin pointed out, the government said the pursuit of Epstein's co-conspirators was ongoing during the Biden administration.",
      "Raskin said the committee is considering reforms that would clarify prosecutors' responsibility to communicate with crime survivors before investigations are closed. And he accused Patel of having \"repeatedly impugned the credibility of the Epstein survivors\" at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in September by suggesting that the information provided by the survivors was not credible.",
      "During the hearing, Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has led an effort to force a vote in the House on releasing the Epstein files, pointed to 20 alleged co-conspirators.",
      "\"According to victims who cooperated with the FBI in that investigation, these documents in FBI possession, your possession, detail at least 20 men, including Mr. Jes Staley, CEO of Barclays Bank,\" Massie said, referring to a banker who left Barclays in 2021 amid scrutiny over his ties to Epstein. Staley, who worked with Epstein for years as a top official at J.P. Morgan, has said they had a \"close professional relationship.\" Staley has denied wrongdoing and said he regrets befriending Epstein.",
      "Massie said other high-profile figures were among those named by Epstein's victims.",
      "\"That list also includes at least 19 other individuals \u2014 one Hollywood producer worth a few hundred million dollars, one royal prince, one high-profile individual in the music industry, one very prominent banker, one high-profile government official, one high-profile former politician, one owner of a car company in Italy, one rockstar, one magician, at least six billionaires, including a billionaire from Canada,\" Massie said.",
      "Massie asked Patel if the FBI had launched any investigations into the individuals and whether he'd seen the 302 documents. Patel responded that he has asked FBI agents to \"review the entirety of the Epstein files and bring forth any credible information.\" He said \"any investigations that arise from any credible investigation will be brought,\" but he added that there have been \"no new materials brought to me launching a new indictment.\"",
      "Asked whether he was asserting that the victims' statements weren't credible, Patel said, \"It's not my assertion, sir, it's the assertion of two different United States attorneys' offices from three separate administrations who investigated those same materials in live time.\"",
      "Raskin said Patel's explanation, along with a later exchange with Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, was not good enough. He wrote in his letter that he is seeking \"an accounting\" of the steps the Justice Department has taken to review the case this year, relevant summaries or reports generated as part of that review and documents related to staffing for Epstein investigative matters.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has inexplicably killed this investigation,\" Raskin said.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 19:18:00 -0500",
    "summary": "After his recent remarks about resuming nuclear testing, President Trump told \"60 Minutes\" \"we're the only country that doesn't test.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's comments about restarting weapons tests are not likely to lead to mushroom-cloud explosions over the New Mexico desert or seismic shaking underground in Nevada, according to the nation's foremost experts.",
      "But questions about\u00a0what kind of testing Mr. Trump does have in mind have been rippling through the nuclear nonproliferation community. In an interview on \"60 Minutes,\" the president elaborated on remarks he made last week announcing a plan to resume U.S. testing of nuclear weapons. \"Other countries are testing,\" he said. \"We're the only country that doesn't test, and I don't want to be the only country that doesn't test.\"",
      "The president did not clarify what type of testing he envisions. The U.S. has not conducted above-ground nuclear tests since the 1960s, and the last underground detonation of a nuclear device in the U.S. occurred in 1992. That test, at the Nevada Test Site, was the final nuclear weapons test before the current testing moratorium was put in place.",
      "Asked if he was announcing that after more than 30 years, the United States planned to start detonating nuclear weapons for testing, Mr. Trump replied that \"we're going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do, yes.\"",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" he said. \"You know, we're an open society. We're different. We talk about it... We're going to test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "On Monday, CIA Director John Ratcliffe posted a brief statement on his personal X account that said President Trump \"is right,\" and showed images related to public U.S. assessments from 2019 by the Defense Intelligence Agency that Russia and China were carrying out low-yield nuclear tests.",
      "Low-yield tests involve very small nuclear explosions that can help researchers study a weapon's efficacy, but are generally banned under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The U.S., China and Russia are signatories to that treaty, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1996, but have not ratified it.",
      "There was no mention in Ratcliffe's post of actions by Pakistan or North Korea.",
      "The CIA declined to comment beyond the director's post.",
      "The White House referred a question about clarifying the president's comments on nuclear testing to what Mr. Trump has said.",
      "Nine countries \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India and Israel \u2014 currently possess a combined total of more than 12,000 nuclear warheads, with the U.S. and Russia accounting for nearly 90% of the global stockpile, according to the Federation of American Scientists.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community's 2025 worldwide threat assessment said Russia's nuclear stockpile was the world's \"largest and most diverse,\" noting that it, in combination with an array of delivery systems, \"could inflict catastrophic damage to the Homeland.\"",
      "The assessment also said China \"remains intent\" on expanding its nuclear posture.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing Monday that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\" And a senior Pakistani security official told CBS News, \"Pakistan was not the first to carry out nuclear tests and will not be the first to resume nuclear tests.\"",
      "George Perkovich, a senior fellow in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Nuclear Policy Program, said experts on nuclear weapons testing believe the president was referencing \"subcritical\" tests, rather than tests that register on the Richter Scale or yield a visible display.",
      "\"These don't produce an explosion. They can be done in laboratories,\" Perkovich said.",
      "Subcritical nuclear tests involve perfecting the final steps in triggering a chain reaction in the lab, and then using computing power to conduct simulations of an actual detonation.",
      "\"Because he kept insisting that everyone else is doing it, I am assuming he means those types of tests that don't involve explosions,\" Perkovich said. \"If these countries have been doing [explosive] tests, then the president just released very highly classified intelligence.\"",
      "Sigfried Hecker, who served as director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1986 to 1997, said the Russians, Chinese and the U.S. all perform subcritical experiments. But another type of nuclear test that the U.S. stopped conducting, called Hydronuclear experiments, involves a tiny amount of explosive \u2013 not enough to be detected by seismic monitors.",
      "\"These are where you barely tickle the bomb, and you get small nuclear reactions,\" Hecker said. \"No mushroom cloud. You're just doing enough to produce a reaction in the plutonium. No risk, no hazard, easily contained. No safety issues.\"",
      "Hecker said he did not know if the president might be referring to that type of test.",
      "\"Whether the president and his advisers are steeped in all of this, I don't know,\" he said.",
      "Samantha Vinograd, a national security expert and CBS News consultant who served as assistant secretary for counterterrorism and threat prevention at the US Department of Homeland Security said \"there are various kinds of tests that the president could be referring to so there are currently a lot of hypotheticals.\"",
      "The White House referred a question about clarifying the president's comments about nuclear testing to what Mr. Trump has said.",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright tried to clarify Mr. Trump's nuclear comments in an appearance on Fox News, saying the president was referencing \"systems tests.\"",
      "\"These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright said. \"These are what we call noncritical explosions, so we're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "As energy secretary, Wright is helping oversee the modernization of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, which he said the president has made a \"critical priority.\"",
      "\"A lot of our weapons are very old and President Trump has been adamant about we have to be on the forefront, we need to be ahead of our adversaries, we need to keep our weapon stockpile modern and upgraded,\" Wright said.",
      "If the U.S. does begin nuclear testing again, China would benefit the most, according to Heather Williams, the director of the Project on Nuclear Issues and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\"The United States has conducted 1,054 tests, and Russia has conducted 715. China only conducted 47 nuclear tests, both above ground and underground,\" Williams said on Saturday.",
      "\"This asymmetry in test data has been a sore spot for Chinese officials who felt disadvantaged by arms control agreements, such as the Partial Test Ban Treaty. If one country returns to nuclear testing, others are likely to follow \u2014 in which case, China would stand to gain the most in terms of weapons design and warhead information, further contributing to its nuclear buildup,\" said Williams.",
      "However, Williams also underscored that both political and scientific leaders have repeatedly said that the U.S. has no technical need to return to nuclear testing.",
      "Olivia  Gazis, \n                                                  \n                                  James  LaPorta and \n                                                  \n                                  Camilla  Schick\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The attack was carried out at the direction of President Trump, Hegseth said in a social media post that included unclassified video of the strike.",
      "\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,\" Hegseth said.",
      "\"Two male narco-terrorists\" aboard the vessel were killed, the defense secretary added, noting that no U.S. personnel were killed in the operation. No further information was provided.",
      "Dating back to early September, the Trump administration has reported well over a dozen such strikes in the waters of the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean off South America on what it alleges are drug vessels. The strikes have killed more than 50 people.",
      "Outside of the unclassified videos released by the Defense Department, the U.S. has provided no details on the boats that were struck or about the people aboard.",
      "The White House says they are part of an effort to cripple the operations of drug cartels. Some lawmakers have criticized the strikes, saying the White House has not provided enough evidence the boats were smuggling drugs, and with some insisting the president needs congressional approval to carry out the strikes.",
      "Mr. Trump on Oct. 23 told reporters, \"Well, I don't think we're going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We're going to kill them. You know? They're going to be like, dead.\"",
      "Several of the strikes have occurred off the coast of Venezuela, as Mr. Trump has been vocal in his criticism of controversial Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and amid a broader buildup of U.S. military assets in the Caribbean.",

The\u00a0process of returning the bodies\u00a0of the last remaining hostages, as called for under the U.S. peace plan, has progressed slowly, with Hamas releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",

      "Hamas has said the work is complicated by widespread devastation.",
      "For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. So far, the bodies of 270 Palestinians have been handed over under the current ceasefire. Fewer than half have been identified. Forensic work is complicated by a lack of DNA testing kits in Gaza. The Hamas-run Health Ministry posts photos of the remains online, in the hope that families will recognize them.",

      "Videos posted online show the quake lasting about 20 seconds. It was so powerful that it was felt in the capital Kabul and neighboring countries, causing panic for families early Monday morning.",
      "Sharafat Zaman, a spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health, said 27 people were killed, most of them in Samangan and the neighboring Balkh provinces. There were also confirmed deaths in Baghlan, Kunduz, Sar-e-Pul and Jawzjan provinces, with a total of 953 confirmed injuries.",

      "Bidding for the iconic suit, complete with the conical hat and matching tunic, will begin at 50,000 pounds, the equivalent of about $65,000, but it's expected to eventually sell for as much as 200,000 pounds, or about $261,000, when the hammer falls at the Propstore Winter Entertainment Memorabilia auction.",
      "According to the description on the Propstore Auction house's website, there are tags reading \"Mr. Ferrell\" on the inside of the tunic and the stockings, with \"Hero-3\" also handwritten on the tunic tag.",
      "The auctioneers say the belt also has \"Mr. Ferrell\" written on it in blue ink.",
      "Large movie productions often create several versions of the same props, but the term \"hero\" is typically used to describe the highly detailed iterations which are central to the plot and intended for close-up shots in the final cut of the movie.",
      "The suit going up for sale does not appear to be the same one that Ferrell wore to an NHL hockey game in Los Angeles just after Christmas last year, when he gave fellow sports fans a giggle by sitting near the ice looking disgruntled with a beer and a cigarette in the garish outfit.",
      "Another notable item up for sale in the December auction is Marty McFly's iconic hoverboard from the second and third installations of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, which is expected to sell for more than $156,000.",
      "According to the product description, it's the lightweight foam version of the prop, which actors used for scenes where their characters were seen carrying the boards, rather than a wooden version that Michael J. Fox and his fellow actors were seen riding in other parts of the movies.",
      "The example of the then-futuristic hoverboard does have some \"wear from use and age, including adhesive residue around the fastening strips, cracks in the foam, and paint chipping throughout,\" according to the auctioneers.",
      "The most valuable lot in the auction, however, will be the original prop used as Boba Fett's rifle in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
      "The auction house says it is the only known example of the prop. Other stunt versions and castings were made for later movies in the franchise, but, according to Propstore Auctions, this EE-3 carbine blaster has been \"identified by its serial number and photo-matched by details on the stock, directly confirming its provenance.\"",
      "The blaster, which started its life as a genuine 1917 Webley & Scott No.1 Mark I flare pistol, is expected to fetch the equivalent of around $915,000 when it goes under the hammer.",

      "The Maldives began implementing a smoking ban Saturday on anyone born on or after January 2007, becoming the only nation with a generational prohibition on tobacco, the Health Ministry said.",
      "The move, initiated by President Mohamed Muizzu earlier this year -- will \"protect public health and promote a tobacco-free generation,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Under the new provision, individuals born on or after January 1, 2007 are prohibited from purchasing, using, or being sold tobacco products within the Maldives,\" it added.",
      "\"The ban applies to all forms of tobacco, and retailers are required to verify age prior to sale.\"",
      "The measure also applies to visitors to the nation of 1,191 tiny coral islets scattered some 500 miles across the equator and known for its luxury tourism.",
      "The ministry said it also maintains a comprehensive ban on the import, sale, distribution, possession, and use of electronic cigarettes and vaping products and it applies to all individuals regardless of age.",
      "Selling tobacco products to an underage person carries a penalty of 50,000 rufiyaa ($3,200), while using vape devices carries a fine of 5,000 rufiyaa ($320).",

    "summary": "Hurricane Melissa was the most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago.",
    "story": [
      "The Jamaican government on Monday said at least 32 deaths have been attributed to\u00a0Hurricane Melissa, with Information Minister Dana Morris Dixon saying there are possibly eight more unconfirmed deaths.",
      "With its tourism season just a month away, officials are rushing to rebuild from the\u00a0catastrophic Category 5 storm\u00a0that shredded the island's western region. Before the hurricane hit on Oct. 28, the government expected Jamaica's tourism industry to grow by 7% this winter season and was preparing to welcome an estimated 4.3 million visitors.",
      "Now, officials are scrambling to repair hotels and clear debris in the western half of the island in the hope of securing tourist dollars at a moment when they're needed most.",
      "Melissa was the most powerful hurricane to lash the island since record-keeping began 174 years ago. The National Hurricane Center said the storm initially came ashore near New Hope, on the southwestern coast of Jamaica.",
      "Before the storm, the Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare. \"There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,\" Prime Minister Andrew Holness had said.",
      "\"We are still doing our assessments, but most of the damage was in the northwest and southwest,\" said Christopher Jarrett, who leads the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association.",
      "He noted that the popular Negril area in Westmoreland was spared major damage.",
      "All international airports in Jamaica have reopened and are receiving commercial flights. But almost a week after\u00a0one of the most powerful Atlantic hurricanes on record\u00a0struck the western end of Jamaica, tourism officials were still trying to get a true picture of the damage to the sector \u2014 a mainstay of the island's economy.",
      "Jarrett said the lobby group that represents private hotels and attractions on the island is still unable to reach many of its members, especially in the western parish of Hanover, as communication and electricity services were down.",
      "\"Every individual member who was affected is doing everything to get back up and running,\" he said.",
      "In recent days, Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett said he expected Jamaica's tourism sector to be back to normal by Dec. 15, the start of the island's peak tourism season.",
      "\"It's doable for some and not for others,\" Jarrett said of the timeline, pointing out that the larger hotel chains would be able to recover quicker.",
      "Jarrett, who operates the family-owned Altamont Court Hotel that has properties in Kingston and Montego Bay, said only one property in Montego Bay sustained roof damage and that repairs were underway.",
      "Despite the disruption to the important tourism sector, Jarrett said he doesn't expect the economic fallout to be significant. He said many hotels in the capital of Kingston and in the northern coastal town of Ocho Rios were gaining business from the influx of aid workers and volunteers in the hurricane's aftermath.",
      "\"Right now, we're giving discounts, between 25% and 50%, and some [hotels] are giving complimentary stays as well,\" Jarrett said.",
      "Tourism is Jamaica's main source of foreign exchange earnings, contributing a combined 30% to gross domestic product directly and indirectly. It employs an estimated 175,000 people and is a major economic driver for other sectors in the Jamaican economy, such as construction, banking and finance, utilities and agriculture.",
      "The disruption to the tourism sector is also affecting many providers of goods and services.",
      "\"With some of the hotels closed and most of the tourists gone, many of us are left without work. This storm didn't just destroy buildings; it shattered jobs and incomes for many of us and our families,\" said Patricia Mighten, who works in the western parish of Hanover as a hotel housekeeper.",
      "Desrine Smith, a craft vendor who plies her trade in the resort town of Falmouth in the northwestern parish of Trelawny, echoed those sentiments.",
      "\"Going days without tourists coming to buy anything means no sales and no money. We survive on daily earnings, and now everything is uncertain,\" she said. \"The hurricane has impacted our pockets hard.\"",
      "Crews are still trying to access 25 isolated areas in western Jamaica as helicopters continue to drop food for them. Nearly half of all power customers remain without electricity.",

    "summary": "The 13th century Torre dei Conti in Rome partially collapsed during renovation work. One worker who was extracted from the rubble died soon after, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Rome\u00a0\u2014 Firefighters late Monday finally managed to extract a worker from beneath rubble inside a medieval tower that partially collapsed during renovation work in the heart of Italy's capital, but the joy of that rescue proved short-lived.",
      "The man didn't withstand the trauma he suffered and died soon thereafter.",
      "\"I express deep sorrow and condolences, on behalf of myself and the government, for the tragic loss of Octay Stroici, the worker who was killed in the collapse of the Torre dei Conti in Rome,\" Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni said in a statement after midnight. \"We are close to his family and colleagues at this time of unspeakable suffering.\"",
      "Images broadcast on local television had shown a trio of rescuers loading the man onto a telescopic aerial ladder, then descending and wheeling him on a stretcher into an ambulance. His state wasn't immediately clear, but Adriano De Acutis, chief commander of Rome's firefighters, said on state television channel RAI that he was conscious.",
      "\"Since the conditions seem serious, they will now evaluate him and he was immediately taken to the hospital,\" Lamberto Giannini, prefect of Rome, told reporters at the time.",
      "Rescuers had faced a complex task as they tried to use a first-floor window to get near the trapped worker. But they were forced to retreat in a cloud of debris as the structure continued to give way. Another approach on two ladders was also aborted, and a drone sent up in their stead.",
      "As dusk approached, firefighters lifted on a crane used giant tubes to suck rubble out of the second-floor window. They continued the work late into the night.",
      "\"The operation lasted a long time because every time a part of the body was freed, there was additional rubble that covered it,\" Giannini said.",
      "Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri had told reporters earlier that the worker was speaking to rescuers and using an oxygen mask. He added that rescuers were working with extreme caution in \"a very delicate extraction operation\" to avoid further collapses.",
      "Three workers were rescued unharmed after the initial midday incident, said firefighter spokesperson Luca Cari. Another worker, age 64, was hospitalized in critical condition; RAI reported he was conscious and had suffered a broken nose.",
      "No firefighters were injured in the ensuing operation.",
      "The Torre dei Conti was built in the 13th century by Pope Innocent III as a residence for his family. The tower was damaged in a 1349 earthquake and suffered subsequent collapses in the 17th century.",
      "Hundreds of tourists had gathered to watch as firefighters used a mobile ladder to bring a stretcher to the upper level of the Torre dei Conti during the first rescue attempt. Suddenly, another part of the structure crumbled, sending up a cloud of debris and forcing firefighters to quickly descend.",
      "The first collapse struck the central buttress of the structure's southern side, and caused an underlying sloped base to fall. The second damaged part of the stairwell and roof, cultural heritage officials said in a statement.",
      "Queen Paglinawan, 27, was attending to a client in a gelato parlor next door when the tower first started coming apart.",
      "\"I was working and then I heard something falling, and then I saw the tower collapse in a diagonal way,\u2033 Paglinawan, 27, told The Associated Press as yet more rubble crashed down.",
      "The tower, which has been closed since 2007, is undergoing a 6.9 million euro (nearly $8 million) restoration that includes conservation work, the installation of electrical, lighting and water systems and a new museum installation dedicated to the most recent phases of the Roman Imperial Forum, officials said.",
      "Before the latest phase was started in June, structural surveys and load tests were carried out \"to verify the stability of the structure, which confirmed the safety conditions necessary\" to proceed with work, including asbestos removal, officials said. The current work, carried out at a cost of 400,000 euros ($460,000), was just about complete.",
      "Italian prosecutors arrived at the scene as the rescue operation was underway, and were investigating possible charges for negligent disaster and negligent injuries, Italian media reported. It is common in Italy for investigations to begin while an event is ongoing and before possible suspects are identified.",
      "German student Viktoria Braeu had just finished a tour at the nearby Colosseum and was passing by the scene during the firefighters' initial rescue attempt.",
      "\"And then we were like, 'It's probably not long until it's going to go down,' and then it just started erupting,'\" said Braeu, 18.",
      "Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Meloni had shared her hopes for a successful rescue.",
      "\"My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to the person currently fighting for his life under the rubble and to his family, for whom I sincerely hope that this tragedy will have a positive outcome,\" Meloni said in a statement.",
      "\"I would like to thank all the law enforcement officers, firefighters, and rescue workers who are intervening with courage, professionalism, and dedication in this extremely difficult situation.\"",

      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. China's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1996.",
      "Pakistan's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1998, and it since then its government says it has observed a \"unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing,\" despite not being a signatory to the international Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).",

      "Asked about Mr. Trump's claims on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\"",
      "She said China hoped the U.S. would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability.\"",

      "Prime Minister Dick Schoof said in a statement that, during a meeting on Sunday with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, he informed his counterpart that the Netherlands would return a bust of a high-ranking official from the dynasty of Pharaoh Thutmose III.",
      "The piece was discovered up for sale at an art fair in 2022 and was confiscated after Dutch authorities received an anonymous tip about its illegal origin, according to a statement from the Dutch government.",
      "The statement said the art show \"trader voluntarily renounced the sculpture\" and that Dutch police and other officials \"have investigated the origin of the head and found that the head was obtained by looting and was unlawfully exported.\"",
      "The bust is expected to be handed over to the Egyptian ambassador to the Netherlands by the end of this year, the statement said.",

      "Belgium's defense minister expressed concern on Monday about a series of unidentified drone flights over the weekend near a military base where U.S. nuclear weapons are stored, saying they seem to be part of a spying operation.",
      "Defense Minister Theo Francken confirmed that drones had flown into the area near the Kleine Brogel air base in northeast Belgium in two phases on Saturday and Sunday night.",
      "The first phase involved \"small drones to test the radio frequencies\" of Belgian security services, then later came \"big drones to destabilize the area and people,\" Francken told public broadcaster RTBF.",
      "\"It resembles a spy operation. By whom, I don't know. I have a few ideas but I'm going to be careful\" about speculating, he said. Last month, several drones were spotted above another Belgian military base near the German border. The operators were not identified.",
      "Russia has been blamed for a number of airspace violations, notably in Estonia and Poland, in recent months. But the perpetrators of a series of mysterious drone flights in Denmark and Germany have been harder to pin down.",
      "A late evening drone sighting at Berlin's Brandenburg airport on Friday suspended flights for nearly two hours. It was not clear who was responsible. On Sunday, some flights were delayed at Bremen Airport in Germany after a drone was spotted in the area, but police did not suspect espionage in that case, local media reported.",
      "Francken ruled out that the weekend drone flights in Belgium might have been a prank. He said that the security services' \"jammer didn't work because they tested our radio frequency, and they changed frequency. They have their own frequencies. An amateur doesn't know how to do that.\"",
      "Asked why it wasn't possible to shoot the drones down, Francken said: \"When they're over a military base we can shoot the drones down. When it's nearby, we have to be very careful because they can fall on a house, a car, a person. That's completely different.\"",
      "This can pose legal challenges too. \"It's not entirely clear. We have to clarify the legal grounds,\" he said.",
      "Francken lamented that Belgium \"is chasing after the threat\" posed by such drone flights. \"We should have bought air defense systems five or 10 years ago,\" that can deal with drones, he said.",
      "A series of mysterious drone overflights have been spotted in the airspace of European Union member countries in recent weeks.",
      "In October, a Belgian official familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News that drones had been sighted over Elsenborn military base, and said that the number of drones was under investigation. Belgium is a member of the U.S.-led NATO military alliance but the source told CBS News that only Belgian forces are stationed at the Elsenborn base.",
      "Also last month, Germany's Munich Airport shut down twice in less than 24 hours after multiple drone sightings. An airport in Lithuania also later closed for several hours overnight Saturday due to a possible sighting of balloons.",
      "In September, the Danish defense ministry said drones were \"observed at several of Danish defense facilities\" during an overnight period. Those drone sightings\u00a0come after several drones were spotted in the Nordic country days earlier, with some of them temporarily shutting down Danish airports.",
      "Drones have also been spotted near military sites in the U.S. this year. The head of NORAD and NORTHCOM \u2014 the military commands that defend North America \u2014 told Congress earlier this year that some of the mysterious drones seen flying inside the United States may indeed have been spying.",

      "Young British children are more likely than their big siblings to adopt American phrases, a new survey of teachers in the U.K. has found.",
      "More than 50% of the teachers at elementary level schools who were surveyed said they had heard their students use the words \"trash\" or \"garbage,\" rather than the more typical British terms \"rubbish\" or \"waste.\"",
      "The word \"candy,\" rather than \"sweets,\" was cited as the second-most imported word, as reported by 40% of the teachers surveyed.",
      "The survey, conducted by Teacher Tapp for The Times of London, involved more than 10,000 educators, and the findings suggest the shift to Americanisms is particularly prevalent among younger children. The survey found that teachers of high school aged children reported fewer examples of such U.S. vocabulary slipping into their pupils' speech.",
      "The terms \"apartment,\" rather than \"flat,\" \"diaper\" instead of \"nappy\" and \"movie theater\" instead of \"cinema\" are some of the other swaps reported by teachers.",
      "A linguist interviewed by The Times, however, sought to reassured concerned parents that trends in children's language change quickly and frequently. Professor Lynne Murphy, who teaches British and American English at the University of Sussex, told the newspaper that academics tend to rely on trends in adult language for that reason.",
      "\"We adults don't talk like we did when we were four, or eight or 12, and neither will today's children,\" Murphy added.",
      "She also noted that while U.S. vocabulary may be imported to Britain via online media, the same thing can happen in the other direction. In 2019, CBS News reported that some parents had noticed their children developing British accents after watching the \"Peppa Pig,\" the British children's program with a remarkable worldwide reach.",
      "Speaking to The Times, some British parents gave anecdotal evidence, saying they had noticed their kids using Americanisms \u2014 and tried to intervene.",
      "Stacie Swift, a mother of three in Cambridgeshire, said: \"I've had to correct my children, who are 10 and eight years old, as they slip into Americanisms.\"",
      "\"Every now and then they slip into conversation. It's usually because they have been watching American YouTube videos or cartoons,\" she added.",
      "Frank Young blamed the \"fragmentation\" of childrens' TV programs in the U.K. for his nine-year-old son's occasional lapses into U.S. parlance.",
      "\"Young children are more likely to hear American accents and the words that go with it through streaming services well beyond the BBC,\" he told The Times.",

    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Palestinian militants have so far released the remains of 20 hostages that were held in Gaza for the past two years as part of the ceasefire agreement in the Israel-Hamas war. But the process of returning the bodies of the last eight remaining hostages, as called for under the U.S. peace plan, is progressing slowly, with militants releasing just one or two bodies every few days.",
      "Hamas says it has not been able to reach all of the remains because they are buried under rubble of buildings destroyed by Israel's two-year offensive in the Gaza Strip. Israel's government and the families of the hostages have accused Hamas of dragging its feet, however, and officials have threatened to resume military operations or withhold humanitarian aid if all of the remains are not returned.",
      "In the most recent release, Hamas returned the bodies on Sunday of three troops killed during its Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on southern Israel. Israel's military confirmed that the remains belonged to hostages Omer Neutra, an Israeli American dual national, Oz Daniel and Col. Assaf Hamami.",
      "In return, Israel has so far released the bodies of 270 Palestinians back to Gaza, including 45 handed over on Monday, according to Palestinian media. Israel has not provided any details on their identities, and it is unclear if they were killed in Israel during the attack on Oct. 7, or if they were Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody, or bodies that were taken from Gaza by Israeli troops during the war.",
      "Health officials in Gaza have struggled to identify the bodies without access to DNA kits.",
      "Who are the 8 hostages whose remains have not been returned?",
      "Itay Chen was an Israeli American originally from Netanya, in central Israel, who was abducted along with two other members of his tank battalion: Daniel Peretz, who also died, and Matan Angrest, who survived and was released from captivity on Monday. Chen loved basketball and studying human biology, according to the Israeli Hostages Families Forum.",
      "Chen was killed on Oct. 7 and his body was taken to Gaza. His father, Ruby Chen, has met frequently with American leaders about bringing all of the hostages back to Israel, including the remains of the dead. Itay Chen is survived by his parents and two brothers.",
      "Meny Godard was a professional soccer player before enlisting in the Israeli military and serving in the 1973 Mideast War, according to Kibbutz Be'eri. He served in a variety of different positions in the kibbutz, including at its printing press.",
      "On the morning of Oct. 7, Godard and his wife, Ayelet, were forced out of their home after it was set on fire. She hid in the bushes for a number of hours before militants discovered her and killed her. She was able to tell her children that Meny had been killed before she died. The family held a double funeral for the couple. They are survived by four children and six grandchildren.",
      "Hadar Goldin's remains are the only ones that have been held in Gaza since before the war. The Israeli soldier was killed on Aug. 1, 2014, two hours after a ceasefire took effect ending that year's war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Goldin is survived by his parents and three siblings, including a twin. He had proposed to his fianc\u00e9e before he was killed. Earlier this year, Goldin's family marked 4,000 days since his body was taken. The military retrieved the body of another soldier who was killed in the 2014 war earlier this year.",
      "Ran Gvili, who served in an elite police unit, was recovering from a broken shoulder he sustained in a motorcycle accident but rushed to assist fellow officers on Oct. 7. After helping people escape from the Nova music festival, he was killed fighting at another location and his body was taken to Gaza. The military confirmed his death four months later. He is survived by his parents and a sister.",
      "Joshua Mollel was a Tanzanian agricultural student who arrived at kibbutz Nahal Oz only 19 days before Oct. 7. He had finished agricultural college in Tanzania and hoped to gain experience in Israel he could apply at home. Two smaller Palestinian militant groups posted graphic footage on social media showing their fighters stabbing and shooting Mollel, according to a Human Rights Watch report. He is survived by two parents and four siblings in Tanzania.",
      "Dror Or was a father of three who managed the dairy farm on Kibbutz Be'eri and was an expert cheesemaker. On Oct. 7, the family was hiding in their safe room when militants set the house on fire. Dror and his wife, Yonat, were killed. Two of their children were abducted and released during the November 2023 ceasefire.",
      "Sudthisak Rinthalak was an agricultural worker from Thailand who had been employed at Kibbutz Be'eri. According to media reports, Rinthalak was divorced and had been working in Israel since 2017. A total of 31 workers from Thailand were kidnapped on Oct. 7, the largest group of foreigners to be held in captivity. Most of them were released in the first and second ceasefires. Rinthalak is the last of three Thai hostages whose bodies were held in Gaza. The Thai Foreign Ministry has said in addition to the hostages, 46 Thais have been killed during the war.",
      "Lior Rudaeff was born in Argentina and moved to Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak at age 7.

      "\"China's testing 'em too,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell in an interview for 60 Minutes. \"You just don't know about it.\"",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it. You know, we're a open society. We're different. We talk about it. We have to talk about it, because otherwise you people are going to report \u2014 they don't have reporters that going to be writing about it. We do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the claim in the interview with O'Donnell that aired just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. China's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1996.",
      "\"They don't go and tell you about it,\" continued Mr. Trump. \"You know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don't necessarily know where they're testing. They \u2014 they test way under \u2014 underground where people don't know exactly what's happening with the test.",

And Russia did make a little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China \u2014 and China does test, and we're gonna test also.\"",
      "Asked about Mr. Trump's claims on Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters during a press briefing that as a \"responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always ... upheld a self-defense nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing.\"",
      "She said China hoped the U.S. would \"take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability.\"",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "President Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plans to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal include conducting actual atomic explosions, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",

      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the international Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which bans all atomic test explosions.",

    "summary": "The former Prince Andrew is set to lose his final military title, as King Charles continues shunning his younger brother over historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, appears set to be stripped of his last honorary military title as the British royals continue their efforts to distance themselves from King Charles III's younger brother over his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"We've seen Andrew surrender the military positions that he's had and we're looking now at the one remaining position he has, which is the honorary vice admiral position, and we've got a process underway for that\" to be removed, Defense Secretary John Healey told Britain's Sky News on Sunday.",
      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",

Hopefully, this\u2019ll work out for me.\u2019 I threw my hat in the ring, and, of course, that began a really long process of getting to the point where I was actually named the first \u2018Golden Bachelor.\u2019\"",

      "Exposing children to peanuts when they are 4 to 11 months old \u2014 instead of waiting until they are 3, as previously recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2014 appears to be making a dent in the number of peanut allergy diagnoses, the study published in Pediatrics suggests.",

      "Hill, one of the study authors, noted that new-onset food allergies overall dropped by 36% in that age group.",
      "Peanuts are one of the primary causes of serious allergic reactions in children.

      "Evolving advice",
      "Before 2015, it was standard practice to caution parents about peanut exposure for children under 3 years of age. Then in 2015, a landmark study \u2014 the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial \u2014 sparked a change in clinical practice.",
      "The study found that for infants who had severe eczema or an egg allergy, exposing them to peanuts when they were between 4 and 11 months old could reduce peanut allergy risk by 81%.",
      "Exposing children to peanuts when they are 4 to 11 months old \u2014 instead of waiting until they are 3, as previously recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2014 appears to be reducing the number of peanut allergy diagnoses. (iStock)",
      "Based on the LEAP trial, leading organizations in pediatric allergy and immunology revised their guidelines for clinical practice in 2015 and 2017, allowing early exposure to peanuts for high-risk children.",
      "\"It just seems like there's this window of tolerance during early infancy.\"",
      "The guidelines were updated again in 2021, encouraging the introduction of peanut, egg and other major food allergens as early as 4 to 6 months for all children \u2014 including those without a history of prior reaction, according to health experts.",
      "\"It just seems like there's this window of tolerance during early infancy, so if we introduced the foods during that window, you will prevent food allergy,\" Dr. Susan Schuval, chief of the Division of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Stony Brook Children's Hospital in New York, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Food allergies can cause hives, difficulty breathing, swelling and vomiting, which can be immediate and life-threatening. (iStock)",

      "These effects can sometimes linger even after the person has recovered from the infection.

      "The Fox News Decision Desk has projected that New York City will elect Democratic Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani as its next mayor. The self-described democratic socialist toppled former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a contentious fight for the future of New York City \u2014 and possibly the direction of the Democratic Party.",
      "Mamdani, the 34-year-old Ugandan-born state assemblyman from Queens, triggered a political earthquake when he declared victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary in June, pulling an upset over a former governor who was widely expected to win the party's nomination.",
      "He has since been catapulted onto the national stage, teaming up with progressive power duo Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to rally New York City voters for his affordability agenda, which includes ambitious campaign promises like rent freezes, fast and free buses, city-run grocery stores and free childcare.",

      "Mamdani's primary success exposed a divide within the Democratic Party, which suffered big losses up and down the ballot last year and has since struggled to put up a united front against the Trump administration without clear party leadership.",
      "Cuomo resigned from office in 2021 in the face of multiple controversies, including several sexual harassment claims, which he has denied. After losing the primary he was expected to win, Cuomo challenged Mamdani as an Independent candidate in the general election, and has since charged Mamdani of being more a socialist than a Democrat.",
      "\"The truth is, there's a quiet civil war going on in the Democratic Party right now,\" Cuomo told Fox News last week. \"You have an extreme left. Radical left. Bernie Sanders, AOC \u2014 Mamdani is just the banner carrier for that movement \u2014 versus the mainstream moderate Democrats. They now call me moderate. They used to call me liberal. Now, I'm a moderate because the whole party shifted.\"",

      "Mamdani, who is of Indian descent, will be the first South Asian and first Muslim mayor of New York City.",

      "Mamdani has maintained that he \"would not recognize any state's right to exist with a system of hierarchy on the basis of race, of religion.\"",
      "When asked during last week's mayoral debate if Mamdani has any regrets about his \"long-standing\" anti-Israel views, the democratic socialist affirmed his commitment to protecting Jewish New Yorkers, as he has throughout the campaign.",

      "With weeks until Election Day, Mamdani charged his opponents and Mayor Eric Adams, who ultimately suspended his re-election campaign after staying out of the Democratic primary to run as an independent, with Islamophobia for a slew of comments made about him on the campaign trail.",
      "Mamdani also faced criticism for his past comments about the New York City Police Department, including those comparing the NYPD to the Israel Defense Forces and calling the NYPD \"racist, anti\u2011queer & a major threat to public safety\" in 2020, among other insults.",
      "\"I'll apologize to police officers right here, because this is the apology that I've been sharing with many rank-and-file officers, and I apologize because of the fact that I'm looking to work with these officers, and I know that these officers, these men and women who serve in the NYPD, they put their lives on the line every single day,\" Mamdani said on Fox News.",
      "As New York City voters began heading to the polls for early voting, billionaires, including Red Apple Media CEO John Catsimatidis and hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman, urged Sliwa to drop out of the race to consolidate support for Cuomo, but the Republican nominee refused to suspend his campaign.",
      "Similar pressure mounted after the primary for either Cuomo or Adams to drop out to boost the anti-Mamdani vote. After Adams suspended his campaign, he ultimately endorsed Cuomo. Trump's Justice Department dropped bribery, wire fraud and conspiracy charges against Adams earlier this year.",
      "Republican mayoral nominee Curtis Sliwa is interviewed by Fox News Digital, in New York City on Aug. 18, 2025. (Paul Steinhauser/Fox News)",
      "Mamdani will also be the first millennial mayor of the nation's largest city.",
      "Such was clear from the early days of Mamdani's campaign, as he made strategic use of social media, including TikTok, to build a recognizable brand and motivate a swath of low-propensity voters.",
      "His campaign played into the hands of an evolving \u2013 and chronically online \u2013 New York City electorate.",

      "During the general election, Mamdani's campaign began collaborating with content creators, inviting New York City's micro-influencers to a \"New Media\" briefing, which are typically reserved for mainstream media, and continuing to walk through the revolving door of podcast appearances, akin to such efforts by the Trump administration in 2024.",

      "\"It tells me that no matter what your politics are, you're feeling the same crisis, and this is a movement that looks to address that crisis\" of affordability, Mamdani said. \"No matter who you are, no matter where you live.\"",

      "How the ghost-tapping scam works",
      "Scammers use near-field communication (NFC) devices that mimic legitimate tap-to-pay systems. In busy places such as festivals, markets, or public transportation, they move close enough to your wallet or phone to trigger a transaction.",
      "The BBB reports that some scammers pose as charity vendors or market sellers who only accept tap payments. Once you tap your card or phone, they charge far more than the agreed amount.",
      "Because the first few withdrawals are usually small, they often go undetected by fraud systems. Victims may not notice until much later, when more money has been taken.",

      "Officials warn that scammers may pressure you to complete payments quickly, preventing you from verifying the amount or merchant name. Some even carry portable readers that can pick up signals through thin wallets or purses.",
      "How to protect yourself from ghost tapping",
      "While the threat of ghost tapping may sound alarming, protecting yourself is easier than you think. A few smart habits and security tools can greatly reduce your risk of falling victim.",
      "Invest in an RFID-blocking wallet or card sleeve to create a physical barrier between your card and potential scanners. These inexpensive tools prevent scammers from reading your card information through clothing, bags, or wallets. Look for sleeves or wallets specifically designed to block wireless communication.",
      "Always check the merchant name and transaction amount displayed on the payment terminal before tapping. Scammers often rush you to avoid scrutiny. Take an extra second to confirm what you see matches what you agreed to pay. If something looks off, cancel the transaction immediately.",
      "Enable instant transaction alerts from your bank or credit card provider. This lets you know the moment a payment is made, giving you a chance to spot unauthorized activity right away. Quick detection can prevent further charges and make it easier to dispute fraudulent transactions.",
      "Bonus protection: Even if you stop a scam early, your personal data can end up for sale online. Our No. 1 identity theft company monitors your credit and financial information, alerting you if your details appear on the dark web or in a data breach.",

      "Crowded environments such as festivals, public transportation, or street fairs create perfect conditions for scammers to blend in. Limit tap-to-pay use in these situations. Instead, use chip or swipe methods, which require physical contact and are harder to exploit.",

      "The technology comes from Electreon Wireless, working with Vinci Construction, Gustave Eiffel University and Hutchinson. Together, they've installed about a one-mile stretch of road near Paris that can transfer energy to EVs in motion.",
      "So far, the system has powered a truck, van, car and bus \u2014 all equipped with special pickup coils. Early tests show the system can deliver peak power over 300 kW and more than 200 kW under steady conditions. That's strong enough to keep large cargo trucks rolling for miles without a pit stop.",

      "Charging ahead: Why it matters",
      "If widely adopted, dynamic wireless charging could change how America powers transportation. Heavy-duty trucks could use smaller, cheaper batteries. Delivery vehicles and buses could stay on the road longer with less downtime.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Most people do not realize their smart TV includes microphones that can capture sound even when voice commands are off. These tiny mics power voice search and assistants, but they also pose privacy risks. If that makes you uneasy, you are not alone. The good news is that it takes only a few minutes to disable your smart TV microphone and protect your conversations.",

      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Step one: Find the built-in mic switch",
      "Before opening menus, check your TV's frame. Many models feature a small hardware switch that turns the microphone off completely.",
      "Look closely along the bottom or sides of your screen. Some switches are labeled \"Built-in MIC.\" On Samsung TVs, it's often near the bottom right edge when facing the screen.",
      "Take back control of your space and enjoy your smart TV safely without your microphone listening.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Slide the switch to \"off.\" Your TV may confirm the change with an on-screen message. This is the most reliable way to stop the mic because it physically cuts power to it.",
      "Step two: Disable the smart TV microphone in settings",
      "If your TV lacks a physical switch, go through its settings menu. While the exact names differ by brand, most follow a similar pattern.",
      "Press\u00a0Home or\u00a0Settings on your remote. Look for main sections such as\u00a0System,\u00a0General or\u00a0Privacy. Inside, you'll find microphone or voice options labeled\u00a0Voice Recognition,\u00a0Voice Assistant or\u00a0Microphone Access.",

      "Step four: Check connected devices and apps",
      "Even after you disable your smart TV microphone, voice-enabled apps and linked devices may still be listening.",
      "Check any connected smart assistants such as Alexa, Google Assistant or Bixby. These platforms can continue capturing audio through your phone, smart speaker or another device on the same network.",

      "Why smart TVs have microphones at all",
      "Manufacturers include microphones to make TVs more interactive. You can ask for weather updates, control volume or find movies with your voice. It's convenient, but it comes with trade-offs.",
      "Some companies state in their privacy policies that voice data may be shared with third parties for analysis. That means your living room chatter could leave your home.",
      "When you disable your smart TV microphone, you keep the benefits of a modern TV while limiting unwanted data collection.",
      "What this means for you",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "A security researcher found a serious weakness in the software that powers thousands of e-commerce sites. The platform, called Magento, and its paid version Adobe Commerce, has a bug that lets attackers break into active shopping sessions. Some attackers can even take control of the entire store.",
      "The flaw is known as SessionReaper. It allows hackers to pretend they are real customers without needing a password. Once they are inside, they can steal data, make fake orders, or install tools that collect credit card details.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "Why is this attack so serious?",
      "The problem starts in the part of the system that handles how a store communicates with other online services. Because the software does not properly check the information it receives, it sometimes trusts data that it should not. Hackers take advantage of this by sending fake session files that the store accepts as real.",
      "Researchers at SecPod warn that successful attacks can lead to stolen customer data, fake purchases and even full control of the store's server.",
      "Once the attack method was shared publicly, cybercriminals began using it right away. Security experts at Sansec reported that more than 250 online stores were compromised within a single day. This shows how quickly attacks can spread once a vulnerability becomes public.",
      "Hackers are exploiting a new flaw called SessionReaper to hijack active shopping sessions on thousands of e-commerce sites running Adobe Commerce and Magento. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Why are many stores still unprotected?",
      "Adobe released a security update on Sept. 9 to fix the issue. Weeks later, about 62% of affected stores still have not installed it. Some store owners are afraid an update might break features on their site. Others simply do not know how serious the risk is.",
      "Every unpatched store remains an open door for attackers who want to steal information or install malicious code.",

      "How can you stay safe when shopping online?",
      "While store owners are responsible for fixing the problem, you can still take smart steps to protect yourself when shopping online. These actions can help you spot danger early and keep your personal information safe.",
      "Always pay attention to how a website behaves. If a page looks odd, loads slowly or shows error messages, it could mean something is wrong behind the scenes. Check for the small padlock symbol in the address bar that shows the site uses HTTPS encryption. If it is missing or the site redirects you to an unfamiliar page, stop and close the browser tab immediately. Trust your instincts if something feels off.",
      "Cybercriminals often use fake promotional emails or ads that look like real store offers. Instead of clicking links in messages or banners, type the store's web address directly into your browser to avoid phishing pages designed to steal your login details or card information. Since attacks like SessionReaper can expose your personal data to criminal marketplaces, consider using a reputable data removal service that continuously scans and deletes your private information, such as your address, phone number and email, from data broker sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft if your information has been leaked through a compromised online store.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Cybersecurity teams at SecPod and Sansec tracked more than 250 stores breached within 24 hours of the exploit going public, showing how fast these attacks spread. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Strong antivirus protection is your silent guard online. Choose reputable software that offers real-time protection, safe browsing alerts and automatic updates. A strong antivirus program can detect malicious code that tries to run on your device, block unsafe sites and alert you to potential threats. This adds another crucial layer of defense when visiting online stores that may not be fully secure.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Whenever possible, choose payment services that add an extra layer of protection between your bank account and the online store. Platforms like PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay do not share your card number with the retailer. This reduces the chance of your information being stolen if the store is compromised. These payment gateways also offer dispute protection if a purchase turns out to be fraudulent.",
      "Stick to stores with a solid reputation. Well-known brands usually have better security and faster response times when issues arise. Before buying from a new website, check its reviews on trusted consumer sites. Look for signs of credibility such as clear contact information, a professional design and verified payment options. A few minutes of research can save you from weeks of frustration.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Updates may seem annoying, but they are one of the most effective ways to protect your data. Make sure your computer, smartphone and web browser all have the latest security patches installed. Updates often fix the exact kinds of flaws hackers use to spread attacks like SessionReaper. Enable automatic updates if you can, so your devices stay protected without extra effort.",
      "If you create accounts on shopping sites, make sure each one has its own strong password. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager to generate and store long, random passwords. That way, if one account is compromised, your other logins stay safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "If a site or payment service offers\u00a0two-factor authentication, enable it. This adds a second security step, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. Even if hackers steal your password, they will not be able to access your account without that second verification.",
      "Even weeks after Adobe issued a critical patch for the SessionReaper vulnerability, nearly two-thirds of affected online stores remain unprotected, leaving customer data and payment information at high risk of theft. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks\u00a0in places like caf\u00e9s, airports and hotels are often unsecured. Avoid entering payment information or logging in to accounts while connected to public networks. If you must make a purchase while away from home, use a mobile data connection or a reliable VPN to encrypt your activity.",
      "Check your financial statements regularly for any unusual activity. Small, unauthorized charges can be early signs of fraud. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank or credit card company right away so they can freeze your account or issue a new card.",
      "If you notice anything strange during or after an online purchase, act quickly. Contact the store's customer service to report what you saw. You should also inform your payment provider or credit card company so they can block unauthorized transactions. Reporting early can help stop further damage and alert other shoppers to potential risks.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The SessionReaper attack shows how fast online threats can appear and how long they can linger when updates are ignored. Even well-known stores can become unsafe overnight. For retailers, installing patches quickly is critical. For shoppers, staying alert and choosing secure payment methods are the best ways to stay protected.",

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to warn about a disturbing new scam where criminals use AI to clone the voices of loved ones and trick victims into sending money.",
      "The dark web often feels like a mystery, hidden beneath the surface of the internet that most people use every day. But to understand how scams and cybercrimes actually work, you need to know what happens in those hidden corners where criminals trade data, services and stolen access.",
      "Cybercriminals rely on a structured underground economy, complete with marketplaces, rules and even dispute systems to operate safely away from law enforcement. By learning how these systems function, you can better understand the threats that could reach you and avoid becoming the next target.",

      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Learn how to protect your personal information from dark web threats with simple cybersecurity habits and tools. (Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)",
      "Inside the hidden layers of the internet",
      "The internet is often divided into three layers: the clear web, the deep web and the dark web. The clear web is the open part of the internet that search engines like Google or Bing can index, including news sites, blogs, stores and public pages. Beneath it lies the deep web, which includes pages not meant for public indexing, such as corporate intranets, private databases and webmail portals. Most of the content in the deep web is legal but simply restricted to specific users.",
      "The dark web, however, is where anonymity and illegality intersect. It requires special software such as Tor to access, and much of its activity happens behind encryption and invitation-only walls. Tor, short for The Onion Router, was originally developed by the U.S. Navy for secure communication but has since become a haven for both privacy advocates and criminals.",
      "It anonymizes users by routing traffic through multiple encrypted layers, making it almost impossible to trace where a request truly came from. This anonymity allows criminals to communicate, sell data and conduct illegal trade with reduced risk of exposure.",
      "Over time, the dark web has become a hub for criminal commerce. Marketplaces once operated like eBay for illegal goods, offering everything from drugs and stolen credit card data to hacking tools and fake identities. Many of these platforms have been shut down, but the trade continues on smaller, more private channels, including encrypted messaging apps such as Telegram. Vendors use aliases, ratings and escrow systems to build credibility.",
      "Ironically, even among criminals, trust is a critical part of business. Forums often have administrators, verified sellers and mediators to settle disputes. Members who cheat others or fail to deliver are quickly blacklisted, and reputation becomes the main currency that determines who can be trusted.",
      "The criminal economy and how scams are born",
      "Every major cyberattack or data leak often traces back to the dark web's underground economy. A single attack typically involves several layers of specialists. It begins with information stealers, malware designed to capture credentials, cookies and device fingerprints from infected machines. The stolen data is then bundled and sold in dark web markets by data suppliers. Each bundle, known as a log, might contain login credentials, browser sessions and even authentication tokens, often selling for less than $20.",
      "Another group of criminals, known as initial access brokers, purchases these logs to gain entry into corporate systems. With that access, they can impersonate legitimate users and bypass security measures such as multi-factor authentication by mimicking the victim's usual device or browser. Once inside, these brokers sometimes auction their access to larger criminal gangs or ransomware operators who are capable of exploiting it further.",
      "Some of these auctions are run as competitions, while others are flash sales where well-funded groups can buy access immediately without bidding. Eventually, this chain of transactions ends with a ransomware attack or an extortion demand, as attackers encrypt sensitive data or threaten to leak it publicly.",
      "Interestingly, even within these illegal spaces, scams are common. New vendors often post fake listings for stolen data or hacking tools, collect payments and disappear. Others impersonate trusted members or set up counterfeit escrow services to lure buyers.",
      "Despite all the encryption and reputation systems, no one is truly safe from fraud, not even the criminals themselves. This constant cycle of deception forces dark web communities to build internal rules, verification processes and penalties to keep their operations somewhat functional.",
      "What you can do to stay ahead of dark web-driven threats",
      "For ordinary people and businesses, understanding how these networks operate is key to preventing their effects. Many scams that appear in your inbox or on social media originate from credentials or data first stolen and sold on the dark web. That is why basic digital hygiene goes a long way. Below are some steps you can take to stay protected.",

      "One of the easiest ways to stay safe online is to use unique, complex passwords for every account you own. Many breaches happen because people reuse the same password across multiple services. When one site is hacked, cybercriminals take those leaked credentials and try them elsewhere, a technique known as credential stuffing. A password manager eliminates this problem by generating strong, random passwords and securely storing them for you.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Antivirus software remains one of the most effective ways to detect and block malicious programs before they can steal your information. Modern antivirus solutions do far more than just scan for viruses. They monitor system behavior, detect phishing attempts and prevent infostealer malware from sending your credentials or personal data to attackers.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Outdated software is one of the biggest entry points for attackers. Cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems, browsers and plugins to deliver malware or gain access to systems. Installing updates as soon as they are available is one of the simplest yet most effective forms of defense. Enable automatic updates for your operating system, browsers and critical applications.",
      "Even if your password gets leaked or stolen,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an additional barrier for attackers. With 2FA, logging in requires both your password and a secondary verification method. This includes code from an authentication app or a hardware security key.",
      "Identity theft protection can provide early warnings if your personal information appears in data breaches or on dark web marketplaces. These services monitor your sensitive data, such as Social Security numbers, bank details or email addresses. If anything suspicious is detected, they alert you. Many providers also offer recovery assistance, helping you restore stolen identities or close fraudulent accounts. While no service can prevent identity theft entirely, these tools can shorten your response time and limit potential damage if your data is compromised.",

      "Starcloud aims to build the first orbital data centers, cutting emissions and speeding up global computing. (Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images)",
      "Why space data centers matter for the future",
      "Every time you send a message, store a file in the cloud or use AI, large computers on Earth handle the work. These data centers use massive amounts of electricity and water to stay cool. They also release heat, noise and greenhouse gases that affect local communities.",
      "Space offers a different environment. Solar energy is abundant, and cooling happens naturally in the cold vacuum.\u00a0\"The only environmental cost is the launch,\" said Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston.\u00a0\"After that, we could save ten times the carbon emissions compared with running data centers on Earth.\"",
      "For a world searching for greener technology, that goal matters.",
      "How the NVIDIA GPU will work in orbit",
      "The Starcloud-1 satellite, about the size of a small refrigerator, will carry NVIDIA's H100 GPU. It is nearly one hundred times more powerful than any chip ever sent into orbit.",
      "Once in space, the GPU will process huge amounts of satellite data. It will study images of Earth to identify wildfires, track crops and monitor weather. Normally, satellites send this data back to Earth for processing, which can cause long delays. Doing the analysis in orbit allows faster results and better decisions on the ground.",

      "Starcloud plans to build space data centers",
      "Starcloud hopes this is only the beginning. The company plans to build larger data centers in space powered by sunlight and cooled by the natural chill of orbit. Future systems will include the next generation of NVIDIA GPUs called Blackwell, which promise even higher performance.",
      "Starcloud's long-term goal is to create a five-gigawatt orbital data center about 2.5 miles wide (around 13,000 feet across). It could handle massive AI workloads while cutting costs and carbon emissions. As launch prices continue to fall, building data centers beyond Earth could soon become practical.",
      "Johnston believes that by the 2030s, many new data centers will operate in orbit instead of on land.",
      "What this space mission means for you",
      "If this works, the technology that powers your apps, games and AI tools might soon be running in space. This change could make cloud services faster, more efficient and less harmful to the planet.",

      "Microsoft's blog recently gave a firm warning: unsupported systems aren't just outdated, they're unprotected. That message targets anyone still using Windows 10, and it's serious. In Microsoft's Digital Defense Report, over 90% of ransomware attacks hit unsupported PCs. That statistic alone should make every Windows 10 user think twice.",

      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Why are unsupported systems dangerous",
      "Unsupported Windows 10 systems no longer get the updates that keep you safe. Without those patches, ransomware and malware have easy access to your files. Once inside, attackers can encrypt your personal data or steal credentials and banking details.",
      "It's not just about losing files. Identity theft and financial fraud often start with outdated systems. The older the software, the easier it is for cybercriminals to exploit weaknesses that will never be fixed.",
      "The \"just one more year\" trap",
      "Many people tell themselves they'll upgrade later. Microsoft calls this \"just one more year\" thinking. The problem is that every delay increases your risk. Extended security updates only offer limited coverage, and they don't stop new types of attacks.",
      "Without Microsoft's regular monitoring, new vulnerabilities stay hidden. You could be using your computer for months while attackers quietly collect your data. That's a frightening thought, especially when most of it can be prevented by upgrading.",

      "Hackers know users delay updates, and they actively look for outdated systems. Even one unsupported device in a home or office network can create a weak spot that exposes everything else.",

      "You can protect yourself right now with a few smart steps. These actions reduce your exposure, tighten your online defenses and prepare you for a smooth upgrade to Windows 11. The good news is that most of these changes only take a few minutes but make a major difference in your security.",
      "HACKERS FOUND A WAY TO TURN OFF WINDOWS DEFENDER REMOTELY",
      "Start by checking whether your PC can handle Windows 11. Most modern AMD and Intel processors already meet the system requirements. Upgrading keeps your computer protected with ongoing updates that patch vulnerabilities and improve overall performance. It's one of the simplest ways to defend against ransomware and malware before they strike.",
      "Be cautious with every link and attachment you receive. Cybercriminals love sending fake update notifications that look like official Microsoft messages. These phishing scams often contain malicious links that install malware in seconds. Before you click, hover over links to verify their source and only download updates directly from Microsoft's official site. To add an extra layer of protection, install strong antivirus software that can detect and block malicious files before they infect your system.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

By limiting what's publicly available about you, you make it much harder for cybercriminals to target you, especially if your older, unsupported Windows 10 system is ever exposed online.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

    "story": [
      "Curtis Sliwa says open-air prostitution on Roosevelt Avenue would expand across New York City if Zohran Mamdani becomes mayor and vows to crack down on landlords and pimps.",
      "Curtis Sliwa and Andrew Cuomo are warning that a prostitution-plagued strip in Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s district will only get worse and could fuel a citywide explosion of vice if Zohran Mamdani is elected mayor.",
      "The rampant sex trade along the seedy strip has been likened to a \"red light district\" with women soliciting sex in broad daylight and gang crime an everyday reality for local residents. The FBI previously told Fox News Digital that it has made the issue a top priority in its efforts to combat violent crime and prostitution.",
      "Sex work along Roosevelt Avenue erupted as a campaign flashpoint after the issue was raised during a recent mayoral debate, with the former New York governor pressing Mamdani over his past support for decriminalizing prostitution.",

      "Mamdani, who leads the race after a surprise Democratic primary win over Cuomo, has faced growing criticism for backing proposals to relax prostitution laws \u2014 a move opponents say would push an already chaotic street over the edge.",
      "As a state Assembly member, Mamdani co-sponsored a bill known as \"Cecilia\u2019s Law\" that would decriminalize certain prostitution offenses and told the Assembly of his \"fundamental belief\" that \"sex work is work\" and that urged a debate on decriminalization. According to The New York Times, for roughly five years he argued publicly that prostitution should be decriminalized.",
      "Sliwa, the Republican nominee, told Fox News Digital that a Mamdani mayoralty would expand prostitution and trafficking across the city and cement Roosevelt Avenue\u2019s reputation as a red-light corridor of illicit activity and violence.",
      "\"I truly believe there will be an expansion of this throughout the city if he should become mayor,\" Sliwa said of Mamdani in a Fox News Digital interview.",
      "\"What you would have in East Elmhurst, Corona, Jackson Heights \u2026 is open-air prostitution from buildings owned by absentee landlords with pimps and madams, women who have been sex-trafficked into this country,\" Sliwa said. \"He\u2019s been very clear: decriminalize prostitution \u2014 prostitutes should have a right to sell themselves anywhere, residential areas, in the street, behind closed doors.\"",
      "During the final mayoral debate, Mamdani sought to distance himself from those earlier positions after Cuomo accused him of supporting full legalization of prostitution and opposing misdemeanor enforcement. If prostitution were decriminalized, it wouldn\u2019t be a crime. Legalizing it means turning it into something the government oversees and sets rules for.",

      "\"Not only have I never called for the legalization of prostitution, I\u2019m not calling for that today either,\" Mamdani said in response to Cuomo at the debate. \"And I also have never said anything about not enforcing misdemeanors.\"",
      "Being in charge of appointing the NYPD commissioner, Mamdani could influence policing priorities and direct the department to scale back raids or quality-of-life sweeps along Roosevelt Avenue. He could also work with the City Council to revise local nuisance laws or business-licensing rules affecting the strip. Critics argue that even symbolic support from City Hall could signal to traffickers that the city is easing up.",

Cuomo] has visited Roosevelt Avenue many times and spoken with residents \u2014 the situation there is out of control,\" spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said. \"Electing Zohran Mamdani mayor would only pour gasoline on the fire and turn all of New York into a red-light district.\"",
      "Azzopardi said Roosevelt Avenue\u2019s problems are just one example of what he called Mamdani\u2019s \"dangerous public-safety platform,\" which he said includes defunding the NYPD, closing Rikers Island prison and turning city buses into \"roaming homeless shelters\" under his free bus plan.",
      "While Sliwa and Cuomo have both talked tough about cracking down on crime along Roosevelt Avenue, Sliwa said Cuomo and Mamdani\u2019s actions have already allowed the strip\u2019s sex trade to flourish.",
      "Mamdani co-sponsored, and Cuomo signed, legislation repealing a law that criminalized loitering for prostitution. Advocates said the statute had been used by police to target transgender women and minority sex workers. Sliwa argues it proves Cuomo wouldn\u2019t be as tough on the issue as he would be.",

    "summary": "to oppose Trump (97%), according to NBC News exit polling",
    "story": [
      "In the first major elections of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, voters in Virginia, New Jersey, California and New York City are expressing broad dissatisfaction with Trump \u2014 and with both political parties, according to early results from the NBC News Exit Poll.",
      "Most voters in those elections are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country today, and they continue to express concern about financial issues and the economy.",
      "Follow 2025 election live updates",
      "The governor\u2019s races in New Jersey and Virginia, as well as a closely watched mayoral election in New York City and the redistricting ballot measure in California, highlight the first big Election Day of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "The results of Tuesday night\u2019s elections will offer an early, though limited, window into how voters feel about his efforts to reshape Washington and the country, providing clues for candidates on both sides ahead of pivotal midterm elections next year.",
      "How is Trump handling his second term in office?",
      "Trump\u2019s overall job approval is underwater among voters casting ballots for governor in New Jersey and Virginia \u2014 two states that have voted against Trump each time he has run for president. Majorities of voters who turned out for the 2025 contests disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president: 55% in New Jersey, 56% in Virginia.",
      "In the New York mayoral race, just 29% of voters approve of Trump, according to the exit poll, as do 36% in California. There, the Proposition 50 ballot measure will decide whether the state will change its congressional map in response to Republican-led redistricting pushed by Trump in Texas and other states.",
      "How do voters see the Democratic and Republican parties?",
      "Beyond views of the president, neither the Republican nor the Democratic Party is seen in particularly positive terms among voters this year.",
      "In Virginia, New Jersey, and California, more voters expressed unfavorable than favorable views of the Democratic Party. Views of the Republican Party are not quite as negative, but still, the party was not seen in favorable terms by a majority in any state surveyed.",
      "A grim national outlook",
      "Voters picking new governors in New Jersey and Virginia also expressed concern about the way things are going in the country these days.",
      "In New Jersey, 65% said they are angry or dissatisfied with the direction of the country, and only 33% said they are satisfied or enthusiastic.",
      "In Virginia, 63% said they are angry or dissatisfied about the direction of the country, compared with just 35% who had positive views of the country.",
      "Economic concerns and the cost of living",
      "Voters in each of the states surveyed over the last several weeks said economic issues \u2014 or the cost of living \u2014 were the most important issues facing their states. In Virginia and California, the economy topped the list of voters\u2019 concerns. And in New York City, 56% of voters said the cost of living was the most important issue. In New Jersey, taxes and the economy both ranked high on voters\u2019 list of concerns.",
      "Financial worries came through as voters described their own families\u2019 financial situations. In each state surveyed, most voters said they were either \u201cholding steady\u201d or actively falling behind financially. Far smaller shares in any state or locality said they were \u201cgetting ahead.\u201d",
      "In several states, voters point to specific financial pains",
      "In New Jersey, a majority of voters said property taxes and electricity costs were \u201cmajor\u201d problems in their state. Overall, 60% said the state\u2019s economy is not so good or poor. Only 38% said it was good or excellent.",
      "In Virginia, where the government shutdown and federal government cuts affected many families this year, 6 in 10 said federal government cuts this year affected their families\u2019 finances a lot (20%) or a little (39%).",
      "A large majority of New York City voters said the cost of living was the most important issue facing the city: 72% said the cost of housing was a major problem, and 65% said the city\u2019s economy was not so good or poor.",
      "Trump on immigration",
      "Trump said he won in 2024 because of the border and grocery prices. But voters today are divided over his actions on immigration.",
      "A slim majority of voters in New Jersey and Virginia said the Trump administration\u2019s actions on immigration enforcement have gone too far, while far smaller shares say they have been about right or have not gone far enough.",
      "Still, many voters are divided over how their states\u2019 governments should cooperate with the federal government on immigration. In New Jersey, voters were likelier to say the next governor should not cooperate with Trump \u2014 though those views were divided by candidate preference.",
      "In New York City, 61% said the next mayor should not cooperate with Trump on immigration enforcement.",
      "In California, 59% said Gov. Gavin Newsom, the Democrat leading the Proposition 50 fight, should not cooperate with the Trump administration on immigration enforcement.",
      "In Virginia",
      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger bested Republican Winsome Earle-Sears for the governorship, NBC News projects, becoming Virginia\u2019s first female governor. Earle-Sears, the lieutenant governor, faced difficult political headwinds \u2014 including cuts to the federal government, a lingering government shutdown and an uncertain economic future in the state.",
      "Many voters tied the cuts directly to Trump \u2014 whose approval is underwater in Virginia. Virginia voters also did not view Earle-Sears as favorably as her predecessor.",
      "Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited, was viewed positively among Virginia voters in the exit poll: 55% approve of the job he is doing as governor. But Earle-Sears\u2019 approval is underwater in comparison (46% have favorable views, 51% have unfavorable views).",
      "Ultimately, Spanberger won over voters who expressed concerns about their personal financial wellbeing \u2014 one of the most important issues in the race.",
      "Spanberger also won over groups that are typically less locked-in. Moderates, independent voters and those who have unfavorable views of both major parties all broke for Spanberger over Earle-Sears. Among those who did not vote in 2024, Spanberger beat Earle-Sears by nearly double digits.",
      "In New Jersey",
      "Democrat Mikie Sherrill defeated Jack Ciattarelli in the New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projected, winning a large share of those who approve of current Gov. Phil Murphy (91%) and those who said their vote today was to oppose Trump (97%), according to NBC News exit polling.",
      "New Jersey voters ranked the economy as one of the most important issues, and Sherill won 6 in 10 of those voters. They also expressed deep dissatisfaction with the direction of the country \u2014 64% said they are dissatisfied or angry and among them three quarters voted for Sherrill.",
      "Sherrill won majorities of voters from traditional Democratic voting blocs: voters under 30 (66%), those with incomes under $50,000 (67%), women (59%) and college graduates (59%).",
      "She was also propelled to victory by first-time voters (66%), Latinos (64%) and independents (52%).",
      "The NBC News Exit Poll is conducted by SSRS, an independent research company, on behalf of ABC, The Associated Press, CBS, CNN, Fox News and NBC. The networks together prepare the questionnaire. More information about SSRS can be obtained by visiting www.ssrs.com.",
      "The 2025 poll, conducted Oct. 22 -Nov. 4, includes representative samples of registered voters in California (n=~4,000), New Jersey (n=~4,000), New York City (n=~3,700) and Virginia (n=~4,000). The Voter Poll combines data collected from verified registered voters online and by telephone with data collected in person from Election Day voters at 30 precincts per state/city, excluding California. Respondents can complete the poll in English or Spanish. The overall margin of sampling error for voters, accounting for design effects, is expected to be approximately plus or minus 2 percentage points in California, 2.1 percentage points in New Jersey, 2.2 percentage points in New York City and 2.1 percentage points in Virginia."

      "Democrat Abigail Spanberger has defeated Republican Winsome Earle-Sears to flip control of the Virginia governorship, NBC News projects, setting her up to become the first woman to lead the state.",
      "Spanberger, a former congresswoman, won the race in the blue-leaning state after holding polling and fundraising advantages throughout the campaign. Her victory provides Democrats with a shot of momentum as the party attempts to chart its path forward after its 2024 election defeat.",
      "With an estimated 89% of the vote in, Spanberger had 56.8% of the vote, compared to 43% for Earle-Sears.",
      "Follow election live updates",
      "Virginia was one of two states, along with New Jersey, that held the first governor\u2019s races of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Spanberger, 47, centered her campaign heavily on economic and affordability issues, as well public safety and her support for abortion rights. Her campaign and allied groups attacked Earle-Sears over her conservative record on social issues and her fealty to Trump.",
      "\"Tonight, we sent message,\" Spanberger said in victory speech in Richmond. \"We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship. We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.\"",
      "Echoing the central themes of campaign, Spanberger promised to \"focus relentlessly\" on \" lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian.\"",
      "Earle-Sears, 61, Virginia's lieutenant governor, struggled throughout much of the race to find a coherent message. She attempted to emphasize the accomplishments of GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s administration, telling voters that electing her would mark a continuation of his record, including growing the private sector of the economy and standing up for \u201cparents\u2019 rights\u201d in schools. In the race\u2019s final weeks, she crafted a \u201ccommonsense\u201d theme that seemed intended to mimic parts of Youngkin\u2019s winning formula in 2021.",
      "Earle-Sears also frequently praised Trump and his policies on the campaign trail, even though the president never even offered a formal endorsement. Trump held a tele-rally for Virginia's Republican candidates Monday night but never mentioned Earle-Sears by name.",
      "In her concession speech, Earle-Sears acknowledged that many watching the race had long ago \"counted me out\" but that \"we kept plugging and plugging.\"",
      "She also noted that Spanberger \"ran as a moderate.\"",
      "\"If she governs as one, then she will unite us, and she'll heal our divides and win our support,\" Earle-Sears said.",
      "Spanberger, a former CIA officer, flipped a Republican-held House seat in 2018 and established herself as a more moderate Democrat, an image she cultivated during her campaign for governor.",
      "She attracted a crowd of big-name Democrats \u2014 and potential 2028 presidential candidates \u2014 to campaign with and for her in the state, helping to punctuate her anti-Trump message in the closing days of the race.",
      "While Spanberger held key advantages, she was also forced to navigate a series of issues that threatened to upend the final stretch of the race.",
      "Those included the federal government shutdown that began on Oct. 1, the emergence of violent text messages sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic attorney general nominee sharing the ballot with Spanberger, and a last-minute redistricting effort by Virginia Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Spanberger this year had seized on the move by Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to shrink the federal workforce. And when the shutdown kicked off, she leaned into blaming Trump and Earle-Sears, arguing that it was just the latest product of the chaos of a GOP-controlled Washington that has hurt Virginia, home to a large number of federal employees.",
      "The economy proved to be a top concern among Virginia voters, according to the NBC News Exit Poll. Nearly half of voters in Virginia said it was the most import issue facing the state. And of those voters who said the economy was the most important issue, 59% supported Spanberger, while 39% backed Earle-Sears.",
      "All told, 58% of voters still said the condition of Virginia\u2019s economy was \u201cexcellent or good\u201d, according to the exit poll. But of the 39% of voters who said it was \"not so good or poor,\" nearly three-fourths voted for Spanberger.",
      "Spanberger also appeared to capitalize on voter anger with the direction of the country and with Trump.",
      "The exit poll found 63% of voters said they were \"dissatisfied or angry\" about the way things are going in the country. Out of that group, 77% said they voted for Spanberger.",
      "A similar dynamic played out with voters' responses on Trump, with more than half (55%) saying they disapprove of how Trump is handling is job as president. Nine in 10 of those voters cast a ballot for Spanberger.",
      "Jones\u2019 texts proved a more difficult situation for her campaign. In those texts from 2022, Jones suggested that one of the top legislative Republicans in the state be shot in the head, triggering bipartisan condemnation and calls from Republicans for Jones to exit the race.",
      "Spanberger immediately condemned the texts but never called on Jones to drop out, and she repeatedly declined to say whether she would retract her endorsement of him.",
      "Republicans up and down the ballot in Virginia began running ads centered on the texts, including several spots from Earle-Sears that prominently featured Spanberger's silence on the issue during the lone debate in the campaign.",
      "Jones went on to defeat Republican incumbent Jason Miyares in the attorney general race in what as broadly a strong night for Democrats in Virginia and across the country. Democrat Ghazala Hashmi also won the state's election for lieutenant governor.",
      "Spanberger also faced relentless attacks from Earle-Sears over her stances on transgender people\u2019s participation in youth sports and use of school locker rooms and public bathrooms \u2014 a reprise of the GOP\u2019s playbook from the 2024 presidential race.",
      "Spanberger typically responded throughout the campaign by saying she felt it was important that such decisions be made by parents, teachers and administrators, not the governor \u2014 a reply that largely avoided the emerging debate within the Democratic Party on the issue.",
      "And while an effort launched by Virginia Democratic lawmakers one week before the election to redraw congressional maps to boost their party ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections added an unexpected wrinkle to the race, it didn\u2019t appear to fundamentally alter it. Earle-Sears, who as lieutenant governor must preside over the state Senate, was called back to Richmond for some of the closing days of the campaign.",
      "Headwinds had also historically favored Spanberger: In 11 of the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial races, voters elected the candidate of the party out of power in the White House."

      "California voters have approved a new congressional map drawn by state Democrats, NBC News projects, giving the party the chance to gain up to five House seats in next year\u2019s midterm elections and counter Republican redistricting efforts in other states.",
      "The approval of the ballot measure allows California Democrats to temporarily circumvent the independent commission that typically controls the redistricting process and enact a more partisan map. The green light from voters will help Democrats limit, but not eliminate, the political disadvantage they\u2019re set to face in the 2026 elections after Republicans in several other states, most notably Texas, redrew maps this year to boost their party.",
      "Follow the election live here",
      "In addition to Texas, where the GOP hopes to gain an additional five House seats under new district lines, Republicans in Missouri and North Carolina have passed maps designed to net the party a new seat in each state. A mandatory redraw in Ohio could also benefit Republicans. And President Donald Trump has continued to push GOP-led states like Indiana and Kansas to help shore up the party\u2019s narrow House majority.",
      "While some Democratic governors and lawmakers are trying to redraw their maps, too, they face additional legal and procedural hurdles that aren\u2019t present in red states because many of them ceded the power to redistrict in recent years to independent or bipartisan commissions.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed hard for Democrats\u2019 redistricting plan, accusing Trump and Republicans of \u201crigging\u201d the midterms elections with their unusual decision to redraw congressional maps for explicit partisan gain outside the regular decennial cycle linked to the census. California Democrats named the bill that authorized the special election the \u201cElection Rigging Response Act,\u201d or Proposition 50, and the flurry of ads blanketing the state in support of the measure underscore that point.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump is out of control, imposing illegal tariffs that hurt our economy and denying disaster aid to California families. Now he\u2019s attempting an unprecedented power grab to steal congressional seats and rig the 2026 election. But we can stop him,\u201d a narrator says in one of the major ads from a group supporting \"yes\" on Prop 50.",
      "\u201cProp 50, the Election Rigging Response Act, thwarts Trump\u2019s scheme,\u201d the narrator continues. \u201cProp 50 levels the playing field in the midterms and gives voters the power to check Trump.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s been almost $100 million in contributions and ad spending in the race, according to campaign finance reports and data from AdImpact, a political ad tracker.",
      "But while Republicans began saber-rattling and promised to go toe-to-toe with the Democratic efforts, the energy and spending for the campaign to defeat the ballot initiative fizzled down the stretch. The two sides were in rough parity on spending on the airwaves in the first month after the election was announced, $16 million to $17 million on either side. Then the \u201cYes\u201d side spent $63 million on ads in the final six weeks, compared with less than $16 million from the \u201cNo\u201d side.",
      "The intensity of the \u201cNo\u201d side\u2019s spending waned in the final weeks, but it had prominent backers, including former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican.",
      "\u201cCalifornia voters established an independent commission led by citizens to stop rigged elections. Prop 50 cancels this historic reform, putting the politicians back in charge,\u201d the narrator says in an ad featuring Schwarzenegger calling on voters to cast \u201cno\u201d votes to \u201cprotect\u201d democracy.\u201d",
      "California already sends 43 Democrats and nine Republicans to Congress, but multiple nonpartisan analyses of the new maps show that the new lines could allow Democrats to flip as many as five seats by making it harder for Republican Reps. Doug LaMalfa, Darrell Issa, Ken Calvert, Kevin Kiley and David Valadao to win re-election.",
      "The outcome is far but certain \u2014 and most of those Republican lawmakers have won tough races before \u2014 but redrawing the lines to add more Democratic voters in their districts will make it tough sledding next fall, especially because the party in power typically faces political headwinds in the midterms."

    "story": [
      "Zohran Mamdani has won New York\u2019s mayoral race, NBC News projects, after the 34-year-old democratic socialist energized progressives in the city and across the country while generating intense backlash from President Donald Trump and Republicans, as well as some Democratic moderates.",
      "Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, on Tuesday handily defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2014 who ran as a third-party candidate after having lost the Democratic primary \u2014 and Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa. Mayor Eric Adams, who mounted a third-party campaign for re-election after he won as a Democrat in 2021, dropped out of the race in September and endorsed Cuomo last month.",
      "Follow the election live here",
      "The victory caps a meteoric rise through New York politics for Mamdani since he launched his campaign roughly one year ago, transforming him from a virtually unknown state assemblyman who barely registered in polling to the incoming leader of America\u2019s largest city.",
      "Along the way, he pushed aside the heir to one of New York\u2019s most iconic political dynasties not once but twice within five months.",
      "Now a nationally known political figure, Mamdani will attempt to enact the sweeping policy platform that inspired his supporters while managing an enormous municipal bureaucracy \u2014 and influencing national politics, as one of the most prominent democratic socialists and Democrats in the country. Among other goals, Mamdani wants to freeze rent on rent-stabilized units, enact universal child care, create a free bus program and launch city-run grocery stores.",
      "\u201cIt is tempting to believe that this moment was always destined,\u201d Mamdani said before thousands at a rally in Queens late last month, before he noted that when he started his campaign, \u201cthere was not a single television camera there to cover it.\u201d",
      "\u201cFour months later and as recently as this February, our support had reached eye-watering heights of 1%,\u201d Mamdani continued. \u201cWe were tied with noted candidate \u2018someone else.\u2019\u201d",
      "Mamdani\u2019s victory is sure to reverberate not just throughout New York City but around the nation.",
      "In New York, Mamdani\u2019s next challenge will be the tall task of uniting leaders in Albany and on the City Council \u2014 many of whom were not eager to line up behind him \u2014 to advance his ambitious agenda.",
      "Nationally, many Democrats will examine his rise from obscurity, his successful messaging on social media and his focus on affordability for clues about how to navigate their own races.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans are eager to turn Mamdani\u2019s left-wing platform into a wedge issue in competitive races far beyond New York City\u2019s borders.",
      "NBC News exit polling found that Mamdani won across racial demographics \u2014 with white, Black, Latino, Asian and voters of other races all backing his candidacy over Cuomo\u2019s and Sliwa\u2019s.",
      "Younger voters overwhelmingly backed Mamdani, with NBC News exit polling showing that voters under 45 years old favored him over Cuomo by 43 points. Voters over 45, meanwhile, backed Cuomo by a 10-point margin.",
      "Education played a big role, too, the exit polling showed. And one of the biggest divides in the election was between New Yorkers who were born in the city and those who had moved to New York within the last 10 years.",
      "Meanwhile, with Mamdani\u2019s pro-Palestinian activism having become a key issue in the race, NBC News exit polling found that Jewish voters favored Cuomo over Mamdani by 29 points, 60% to 31%.",
      "Speaking to supporters after his defeat on Tuesday, Cuomo thanked Adams, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former New York Gov. David Paterson for their support. He called voters at his election eve party \"New York patriots.\"",
      "\u201cThis campaign was the right fight to wage,\" Cuomo said. \"And I am proud of what we did and what we did together. This campaign was to contest the philosophies that are shaping the Democratic Party, the future of this city and the future of this country. And this coalition transcended normal partisan politics.\u201d",
      "The closing weeks of the race turned into a brawl between Mamdani and Cuomo, the onetime front-runner who spent the general election trying to play catch-up. The two had heated debates in recent weeks, with Cuomo calling Mamdani a \u201cdivisive force in New York\u201d while Mamdani painted Cuomo as Trump\u2019s \u201cpuppet.\u201d",
      "Trump made a late jump into the race Monday night, endorsing Cuomo on social media and saying a vote for Sliwa, the Republican nominee, was essentially a vote for Mamdani in the split general election field.",
      "Interestingly, exit polling showed self-identified Republicans favored Cuomo over Sliwa, with 61% of Republicans him while just 35% backed Sliwa.",
      "Late last month, Mamdani delivered an emotional address condemning what he slammed as \u201cracist, baseless\u201d attacks he has faced for his Muslim faith. He will be the first Muslim mayor in New York City history. His unapologetically pro-Palestinian stance energized progressives who oppose Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, as pro-Israel Democrats and donors grew anxious about his rise.",
      "At a rally alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., days later, Mamdani said Cuomo, Adams and Sliwa possess only \u201cthe playbook of the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey have sought to make this election a referendum not on the affordability crisis that consumes New Yorkers\u2019 lives,\u201d he said, \u201cbut on the faith I belong to and the hatred they seem to normalize.\u201d"

      "Spanberger, 47, centered her campaign heavily on economic and affordability issues, as well public safety and her support for abortion rights. Her campaign and allied groups attacked Earle-Sears over her conservative record on social issues and her fealty to Trump.",
      "\"Tonight, we sent message,\" Spanberger said in victory speech in Richmond. \"We sent a message to the whole world that in 2025 Virginia chose pragmatism over partisanship. We chose our Commonwealth over chaos.\"",
      "Echoing the central themes of campaign, Spanberger promised to \"focus relentlessly\" on \" lowering costs, keeping our communities safe and strengthening our economy for every Virginian.\"",
      "Earle-Sears, 61, Virginia's lieutenant governor, struggled throughout much of the race to find a coherent message. She attempted to emphasize the accomplishments of GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s administration, telling voters that electing her would mark a continuation of his record, including growing the private sector of the economy and standing up for \u201cparents\u2019 rights\u201d in schools. In the race\u2019s final weeks, she crafted a \u201ccommonsense\u201d theme that seemed intended to mimic parts of Youngkin\u2019s winning formula in 2021.",
      "Earle-Sears also frequently praised Trump and his policies on the campaign trail, even though the president never even offered a formal endorsement. Trump held a tele-rally for Virginia's Republican candidates Monday night but never mentioned Earle-Sears by name.",
      "In her concession speech, Earle-Sears acknowledged that many watching the race had long ago \"counted me out\" but that \"we kept plugging and plugging.\"",
      "She also noted that Spanberger \"ran as a moderate.\"",
      "\"If she governs as one, then she will unite us, and she'll heal our divides and win our support,\" Earle-Sears said.",
      "Spanberger, a former CIA officer, flipped a Republican-held House seat in 2018 and established herself as a more moderate Democrat, an image she cultivated during her campaign for governor.",
      "She attracted a crowd of big-name Democrats \u2014 and potential 2028 presidential candidates \u2014 to campaign with and for her in the state, helping to punctuate her anti-Trump message in the closing days of the race.",
      "While Spanberger held key advantages, she was also forced to navigate a series of issues that threatened to upend the final stretch of the race.",
      "Those included the federal government shutdown that began on Oct. 1, the emergence of violent text messages sent by Jay Jones, the Democratic attorney general nominee sharing the ballot with Spanberger, and a last-minute redistricting effort by Virginia Democratic lawmakers.",
      "Spanberger this year had seized on the move by Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to shrink the federal workforce. And when the shutdown kicked off, she leaned into blaming Trump and Earle-Sears, arguing that it was just the latest product of the chaos of a GOP-controlled Washington that has hurt Virginia, home to a large number of federal employees.",
      "The economy proved to be a top concern among Virginia voters, according to the NBC News Exit Poll. Nearly half of voters in Virginia said it was the most import issue facing the state. And of those voters who said the economy was the most important issue, 59% supported Spanberger, while 39% backed Earle-Sears.",
      "All told, 58% of voters still said the condition of Virginia\u2019s economy was \u201cexcellent or good\u201d, according to the exit poll. But of the 39% of voters who said it was \"not so good or poor,\" nearly three-fourths voted for Spanberger.",
      "Spanberger also appeared to capitalize on voter anger with the direction of the country and with Trump.",
      "The exit poll found 63% of voters said they were \"dissatisfied or angry\" about the way things are going in the country. Out of that group, 77% said they voted for Spanberger.",
      "A similar dynamic played out with voters' responses on Trump, with more than half (55%) saying they disapprove of how Trump is handling is job as president. Nine in 10 of those voters cast a ballot for Spanberger.",
      "Jones\u2019 texts proved a more difficult situation for her campaign. In those texts from 2022, Jones suggested that one of the top legislative Republicans in the state be shot in the head, triggering bipartisan condemnation and calls from Republicans for Jones to exit the race.",
      "Spanberger immediately condemned the texts but never called on Jones to drop out, and she repeatedly declined to say whether she would retract her endorsement of him.",
      "Republicans up and down the ballot in Virginia began running ads centered on the texts, including several spots from Earle-Sears that prominently featured Spanberger's silence on the issue during the lone debate in the campaign.",
      "Jones went on to defeat Republican incumbent Jason Miyares in the attorney general race in what as broadly a strong night for Democrats in Virginia and across the country. Democrat Ghazala Hashmi also won the state's election for lieutenant governor.",
      "Spanberger also faced relentless attacks from Earle-Sears over her stances on transgender people\u2019s participation in youth sports and use of school locker rooms and public bathrooms \u2014 a reprise of the GOP\u2019s playbook from the 2024 presidential race.",
      "Spanberger typically responded throughout the campaign by saying she felt it was important that such decisions be made by parents, teachers and administrators, not the governor \u2014 a reply that largely avoided the emerging debate within the Democratic Party on the issue.",
      "And while an effort launched by Virginia Democratic lawmakers one week before the election to redraw congressional maps to boost their party ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections added an unexpected wrinkle to the race, it didn\u2019t appear to fundamentally alter it. Earle-Sears, who as lieutenant governor must preside over the state Senate, was called back to Richmond for some of the closing days of the campaign.",
      "Headwinds had also historically favored Spanberger: In 11 of the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial races, voters elected the candidate of the party out of power in the White House."

      "UPS Flight 2976, with three crew members on board, crashed around 5:15 p.m. departing Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said.",
      "At least seven people are dead, Gov. Andy Beshear said on X Tuesday night, \"with that number expected to rise.\" He said earlier that at least 11 were injured.",
      "Beshear called the event \u201ca catastrophic crash.\" The plane crashed adjacent to the airport, and a petroleum recycling business and an auto parts business are in the area that was hit, he said.",
      "The auto parts business has accounted for all of its employees but two, \"but they do not know how many other individuals, customers or others, could have been on site at the time,\" Beshear said.",
      "\"Because of the nature of these facilities, it may be some time before we can account for everyone or know that no one else was on the grounds,\" he said.",
      "The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, was headed to Honolulu, the FAA said. It crashed \"when departing the West Runway,\" according to the airport.",
      "The crash happened 3 miles south of the airfield, said Officer Johnathan Biven, a spokesperson at the airport.",
      "Video from the scene showed a large fire and huge plume of black smoke rising from the crash site. The plane had around 38,000 gallons of fuel on board, officials said.",
      "Louisville Metro Emergency Services Director Edward Meiman said authorities were going door to door to make sure that businesses and facilities had everyone accounted for and have left the immediate area.",
      "\u201cObviously, everybody can see how big this site actually is,\u201d Meiman said. There were several explosions after the crash, he said.",
      "Beshear said officials don't believe there was any cargo on the plane that would cause an environmental impact. However, he said, the area where the crash occurred could create an environmental impact. He urged people to obey shelter-in-place orders.",
      "Police said people in areas north of the Outer Loop to the Ohio River should shelter in place.",
      "A shelter-in-place order had initially included a 5-mile radius, and Meiman said the fire was so hot \"it was kind of creating its own atmosphere and doing really what it wanted to do.\"",
      "UPS has a large presence in Louisville. UPS Air Operations is headquartered in the city, where it also has its main hub.",
      "UPS began its overnight air service with its main hub at the airport, known by the letters SDF, in 1982.",
      "UPS is the biggest employer in the Louisville area, with around 25,000 people working for the company there. Around 400 flights arrive and depart each day at its hub, the city says on its website.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board and the FAA will investigate, the agencies said. The NTSB said it was sending a team to the site."

    "story": [
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday that the U.S. might be forced to close parts of its airspace if staffing shortages amid the government shutdown continue.",
      "The shutdown, which is dragging into its second month, has meant that essential workers, including air traffic controllers, have been working without pay. That has led to a shortage of anywhere from 2,000 to 3,000 controllers, Duffy said.",
      "\"So if you bring us to a week from today, Democrats, you will see mass chaos,\" he said at a news briefing with the Philadelphia-area SEPTA rail system. \"You will see mass flight delays. You\u2019ll see mass cancellations, and you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don\u2019t have the air traffic controllers.\"",
      "Flight delays and cancellations have been piling up at airports across the U.S. following the shutdown, which the White House blames on Democrats.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has rebutted accusations from the other side of the aisle, saying his party \"will not support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the healthcare of the American people.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s been our position week after week after week, and it will continue to be our position because the Republican healthcare crisis is crushing the American people,\" Jeffries said in a news release Monday. \"And now that we\u2019re in the midst of open enrollment, tens of millions of Americans all across the country are realizing that their premiums, co-pays and deductibles are going to skyrocket, in some cases $1,000 to $2,000 more per month that working-class Americans are being asked to pay.\"",
      "Duffy said at Tuesday's briefing that he does not know what the Democrats are asking for through the shutdown, adding that it is at the expense of the American people.",
      "\"Make no mistake, the longer this goes on, every day these hardworking Americans have bills they have to pay, they\u2019re being forced to make decisions and choices,\" Duffy said. \"Do they go to work as an air traffic controller, or do they have to find a different job to get resources, money, to put food on their table, to put gas in their car?\"",
      "Duffy said the situation at airports will only get worse as the shutdown drags on. Addressing air travel safety, he said flight delays and cancellations are ways to ensure safety.",
      "\"But with this shutdown, it would be dishonest to say that more risk is not injected into the system,\" he said. \"There is more risk in the system.\"",
      "In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration said airports in Houston experienced \"longer than normal delays in screening\" due to staffing shortages over the weekend.",
      "\"While the vast majority of our nationwide operations remain minimally impacted by the government shutdown, occasional delays are to be expected,\" the TSA said in the statement. \"The longer the shutdown goes on, the more severe the impact on our TSA workforce who have expenses they must pay for, making it harder to show up for work when not being paid.\"",
      "On Tuesday afternoon, more than 1,800 flights traveling within, to and out of the U.S. were delayed, and over 50 were canceled, according to FlightAware.com. Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York accounted for most of it, with over 150 delays and 14 cancellations between them. It was not immediately clear where all the delays were due to staffing.",
      "Arrivals at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport were delayed by almost an hour because of due to staffing issues Tuesday morning, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "The weekend experienced the most difficult travel conditions yet, with more than 5,000 flights departing and arriving at U.S. airports delayed on Sunday alone."

    "story": [
      "As the government shutdown is set to become the longest in U.S. history, Pennsylvania organizations that rely on government support are experiencing an unusual and devastating double whammy.",
      "That\u2019s because the state is in the midst of its own budget impasse. The Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic House have been in a deadlock over the 2025-26 budget for more than 120 days, freezing billions in state funding.",
      "The consequences of the dual shutdowns are becoming dire for organizations like the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence (PCADV), a nonprofit that helps victims of domestic violence find safety, counseling and legal advocacy through a network of 59 community-based domestic violence programs across the state.",
      "PCADV receives 53% of its budget from federal funds and 43% from the state, and it operates on a reimbursement basis. Since the state budget impasse began, it is owed more than $11 million for services already provided, according to CEO Susan Higginbotham.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect storm,\u201d she said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cThis spells disaster for nonprofit programs providing services to people because, first of all, a number of programs are having to lay off staff or furlough staff, or think about how they can reduce the experience. I mean, you know, this is impossible to manage, really.\u201d",
      "We\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you\u2019re a federal employee who can\u2019t work right now, a person who relies on federal benefits like SNAP, or someone who is feeling the effects of other shuttered services in your everyday life. Please contact us at tips@nbcuni.com or reach out to us here.",
      "Higginbotham warned that if the dual impasses continue, PCADV\u2019s statewide network of programs, which provide services for approximately 90,000 domestic violence survivors and their children, may have to begin laying off staff or permanently close their doors.",
      "\u201cIf that happens, it\u2019s not going to help to blame \u2018Rs\u2019 or \u2018Ds\u2019 for it, or for them to blame each other. It\u2019s too late at that point. We just want them to pass a budget. Figure it out,\u201d she said.",
      "Daniel Mallinson, a political scientist at Penn State University, said that the Pennsylvania budget impasse could end when enough people apply pressure on their lawmakers to find a solution. However, he added, those most negatively affected by the compounding shutdown consequences are marginalized people who \u201cdon\u2019t have as much political sway.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of the people that have the most political sway are more in that category of \u2018it doesn\u2019t really impact me right now,\u2019\u201d Mallinson said, while \u201cit\u2019s a daily reality\u201d for marginalized groups that depend on government-funded services.",
      "Among the hardest hit are students, as schools across the commonwealth wait on $5.3 billion in missed state funding, according to Chris Lilienthal, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania State Education Association.",
      "Pennsylvania schools have had to suspend afterschool programs, implement spending freezes, and at least three school districts have said that they are on the brink of closing down entirely, Lilienthal said.",
      "Lilienthal explained that districts that rely more heavily on government funding are \u201cin a much worse situation\u201d than schools with wealthier tax bases and more local revenue.",
      "This coincides with the suspension of federal SNAP nutrition benefits, which serve nearly 2 million Pennsylvanians, including 713,000 children, according to a report released by Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cThe loss of these SNAP benefits, it is just making it that much harder for kids in the classroom,\u201d Lilienthal said. \u201cOf all the impacts of the federal shutdown, this is the one that has driven the most calls to our union, the most concerns from our members. What\u2019s going to happen to the kids if they don\u2019t have access to these SNAP nutrition benefits?\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration said this week that it would use contingency funds to pay out partial SNAP benefits for November following a judge\u2019s order. But that could take \u201cseveral weeks,\u201d the Agriculture Department said.",
      "In Washington, after weeks without any movement, senators predicted Monday that bipartisan talks among rank-and-file members could mean an end to the shutdown as soon as this week.",
      "There are the first glimpses of progress in Pennsylvania, too, as Shapiro and leaders from the state House and Senate met in person several times last week, Spotlight PA reported."

      "\u201cI want all federal employees to be paid. I want all the programs to be funded,\u201d Greene, R-Ga., said Tuesday on the ABC show. \u201cThat is our job, all of us together, Republicans and Democrats, in the House and the Senate.\u201d",
      "The shutdown has now tied the longest in U.S. history, disrupting paychecks and curtailing or halting many services at federal agencies. Most government workers are furloughed or working without pay, and millions of households haven't received their November benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.",
      "Greene, who has not held back from faulting fellow Republicans during the standoff, said Tuesday she had grown \u201creally tired of the pissing contest in Washington, D.C., between the men.\u201d",
      "Her frustration was especially pointed toward House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Greene said that she \u201cyelled at\u201d him last week, and criticized her party for failing to plan for expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, which, though she is not a fan, could leave millions of Americans facing higher insurance costs next year.",
      "Extending the expiring Obamacare funding is Democrats\u2019 top demand amid the shutdown. Republicans are divided on the issue, with some swing-district members in the House and certain senators calling for an extension of the funds.",

      "Those comments drew loud applause from the studio audience.",

      "She argued on Tuesday that the party\u2019s internal roadblocks are stopping legislation from moving forward, including a bill that she said would end capital gains taxes on the sale of a primary residence.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t even get it to the floor for a vote without Mike Johnson approving it,\u201d she said, and then invited Johnson to appear on \"The View.\"",
      "Greene acknowledged that she has been attacked online for agreeing to appear on \"The View,\" but did not soften her response. She blamed what she called \u201cweak Republican men\u201d for the party\u2019s inability to deliver on its promises.",
      "\u201cWhen I ran in 2020, I ran criticizing Republicans and Democrats,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no problem pointing fingers at everyone.\u201d",
      "Greene has won fans among some Democrats for her outspoken criticism of her party, especially over the shutdown, Trump\u2019s sweeping global tariffs and the war in Gaza, which she has called \u201ca genocide.\u201d But she has conspicuously avoided turning that criticism toward the president.",
      "When one of the hosts remarked that Trump \u201cmay not love you back right now,\u201d Greene responded simply, \u201cThat\u2019s OK.\u201d",
      "Greene also argued that both parties had mishandled government records related to Jeffrey Epstein, calling it \u201ca failure across administrations.\u201d Trump has offered similar criticism of Democrats, even as critics say his own administration has failed to turn over all of the documents in its possession.",
      "\u201cYou are all victims of the political industrial complex,\u201d Greene said. \u201cIt\u2019s built on fundraising and fighting and toxic \u2014 just garbage, and that exists all over social media. That\u2019s not going to solve our problems in this country.\u201d",

      "Ahead of the film\u2019s release on Nov. 21, there are going to be multiple premieres around the world, including the first international event in the Brazilian city on Nov. 4. But a day before fans expected to see Grande, Cynthia Erivo and more cast members posing on the red carpet, the 32-year-old singer and actor announced on her Instagram story that she won\u2019t be able to attend the premiere due to a plane issue.",
      "\u201cBrazil, i can\u2019t believe this is happening and i am beyond devastated to be sending this message. a few hours ago, my team and i had to deplane our flight as they had to do maintenance on the plane due to a safety issue and it will not be taking off until 11am tomorrow which means that i would not be making it in time for the Wicked For Good S\u00e3o Paulo premiere,\u201d she began in a lengthy statement posted Nov. 3. \u201cMy team and Universal have tried every single thing possible to fix this, we\u2019ve searched every other flight, overnight, early morning, connecting flights, commercial and also private options and absolutely nothing was available or possible that would get us there in time.\u201d",

      "But it seems that some fans were not satisfied with Grande\u2019s explanation and apology. Hours before the S\u00e3o Paulo event, Grande returned to the social media platform to share another statement in which she encouraged fans to be more understanding.",
      "\u201cPlease don\u2019t wish danger on us. we did everything we could and i promise you no one is more upset than i am, i promise,\u201d she wrote in a since-deleted message on her Instagram story Nov. 4 and included a heart. \u201cNo matter how upset or disappointed you are, please please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn\u2019t try \u2026 there was no other time for me to leave and these plans have been booked for months.\u201d",
      "She shared that she has had a busy schedule recently, balancing finishing another film and working \u201call day\u201d the past two days. Grande also added that she was scheduled to fly to Brazil the same day as co-stars Erivo and Jonathan Bailey, as well as director Jon M. Chu, but her flight issues altered their plans.",
      "\u201cSo please know how disappointed i am \u2026 sending lots of love to you all,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a beautiful and safe night. i love Brazil, i always have, i always will.\u201d",
      "Although fans won\u2019t get to witness Glinda and Elphaba reunite in S\u00e3o Paulo, they\u2019ll have other opportunities to see the duo together again this month. There will be a \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d global tour, including a  premiere in Paris on Nov. 7, one in London on Nov. 10, another in Singapore on Nov. 13 and a New York City premiere on Nov. 17.",

      "The other film Grande was referring to in her post was the upcoming sequel \u201cFocker-In-Law.\u201d She announced on Instagram Oct. 31 that she had wrapped filming for the flick, out next November. \u201cThese past few months have been so, so unimaginably special. i love my Fockers, and i love my Byrnes\u2026 so, so very much \u2661 i will miss this bunch terribly,\u201d she captioned a series of photos that showed her with a few cast members, including Ben Stiller."

I'm not spending all this money on Black Friday. I'm not spending all this money on Christmas fueling the economy when the economy is not fueling us,'\" she said in a video.",

You want to post about Mariah saving Christmas? Well, how about Mariah, actually do something about, oh I don't know, saving Christmas? Or how about you, Sephora, why don't you step in and do something charitable instead of profitable for a change?\" she said.",
      "TikTok user @nathanramospark pointed out that \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" is, at its core, an \"anti-capitalism song\" since it talks how gifts don't matter. The song goes, \"All I want for Christmas is you,\" after all.",

      "\u201cSo the message here is \u2018working class on strike for being overworked and underpaid gets turned into snowman and is forced to work anyway\u2019?\u201d one Instagram user commented.",
      "It's worth noting that this isn\u2019t the first time Carey and Eichner have teamed up to spread holiday cheer. In 2020, the comedian was one of several stars to appear in Carey\u2019s Apple TV special, \u201cMariah Carey\u2019s Magical Christmas Special.",
      "In a trailer for the special, Eichner is dressed up as an elf, wearing an outfit similar to \u2014 but not exactly like \u2014 the one he wears in the 2025 \"It's Time\" video."

      "\"So they crash into a mountain, and it becomes about them trying to survive, and slowly they wonder if they need to eat each other,\" he laughed. \"And they brought me in at some point and they wrote a new script, which was what became 'Anchorman.'\"",

      "\"But DreamWorks had just put us in turnaround, which means they weren\u2019t going to make it,\" he said of \"Anchorman.\"",

      "Thanks to that decision, \"Anchorman\" was put in production, and in 2004, it hit theaters.",
      "\u201c(Spielberg) was the reason Adam and Will were allowed to make 'Anchorman,\u2019\u201d Apatow said.",
      "Along with Ferrell, the movie featured then-rising comedians like Paul Rudd, David Koechner, Christina Applegate and Steve Carell.",
      "Apatow said Carell specifically always had the movie's staff in tears.",
      "\"If you were on the set of 'Anchorman,' and you were just watching the shoot, there was no one there who wasn\u2019t like, 'Steve Carell is the funniest guy ever,'\" he said.",
      "\"So just one day I\u2019m like, 'Do you have any ideas for yourself as a lead?' And then one day he told me about a sketch he worked on once about a guy who is at a poker game, and they were all talking dirty about sex, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s lying and hasn\u2019t had sex. And I thought, 'Sadly, I understand that,'\" Apatow laughed. \"I know how to develop that.\"",
      "That movie turned into Carell's breakout film \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin.\"",
      "When asked what advice he would give to people who are trying to get into comedy, Apatow turns to his new book, \"Comedy Nerd: A Lifelong Obsession in Stories and Pictures.\"",
      "\"Part of how I built the book is that I put all the failures in there also. So all the pilots that weren\u2019t picked up, everything that was a bomb. And I talk about how that happened. How did things fall apart? What\u2019s it like when they work? What\u2019s it like when they don\u2019t work?\" he said.",
      "\"So you have to really be strong, and find your voice, and not give up,\" he added. \"I always say, if you give up, it\u2019s not going to work. So, the key is not quitting.\""

      "Plus, one of his best friends is headed to New York to cheer him on throughout the race. He's also planning on having another special someone there: Olandria.",
      "\"She's flying in the day of the marathon, so hopefully she'll catch me at the finish line,\" he says.",
      "Nic and Olandria both rose to pop culture prominence as contestants on the seventh season of \"Love Island USA,\" which premiered in June 2025. After sharing a kiss in the first episode, they each moved on into different couplings, until fate \u2014 or more accurately Casa Amor \u2014\u00a0intervened.",
      "Both Nic and Olandria were dumped from the show during Casa, but a getaway car twist whisked them away to a date, where they were given the option to return to the villa if they coupled up. They chose to give a romance a try with the Soul Ties kiss heard 'round the world, much to the joy of their devoted legion of \"Nicolandria\" fans who say they saw their chemistry on Day 1.",
      "Their coupling finally stuck in the final week of the show, and Nic and Olandria were voted Season 7's runners-up, just behind Amaya Espinal and Bryan Arenales.",
      "Since leaving the villa, they've experienced a whirlwind of events, interviews, sponsorship opportunities and more.",
      "\"I feel like it's been a year in the last four months with the way that things are going,\" Nic says. \"You get maybe like one breather a week, so taking those breathers a week is helpful, and that's I guess the way that I stay present.\"",
      "Just over a week before the marathon, Nic was in Miami for a launch party hosted by Celsius. There, he met up with Rob and Kendall from the show's breakout Season 6. Because they have shared \"lore,\" as Nic puts it, they didn't end up talking much about what happened during their time in \"Love Island\" villa.",
      "\"I asked Rob specifically how he's been navigating the life afterwards,\" Nic says. \"I think asking people from the last cast is so beneficial, because they've literally gone through the same thing.\"",
      "His biggest insight?",
      "\"The thing that I noticed was that Rob and Kendall just seem to be the same people they were online. And so I think the biggest takeaway is just being who you are, and if people can't accept that, then they're not your cup of tea,\" he says.",
      "When it came to balancing marathon prep with all his opportunities, Nic says finding the time to run helped quiet all the \"noise.\"",
      "\"They don't go hand in hand,\" he says of his busy schedule and training. \"But after doing the events at night it's nice to wake up early in the morning and get the run done. It's definitely a way to clear the mind.\"",
      "Nic finished his past two marathons in around five hours and 20 minutes, \"so I think hopefully that'll be pretty easy to beat,\" he says.",
      "\"That's the goal ... under five hours would be great,\" he adds.",
      "After the race and into November, he says he and Olandria will have a \"lot more downtime.\"",
      "\"I think at this point we're looking for just a breath of a fresh air from all the hectic-ness,\" he says.",
      "\"I've said this before, like I want to go on our hot air balloon date, I want to do all these things \u2014\u00a0but at this point, I'm like, I just want to sit on a couch and do nothing with her,\" he adds. \"That sounds elite.\""

      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be very ugly because I always try to do something different,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought last year, I was very cute with my husband as E.T. And the year before that, we were the big peacock with performers.\u201d",
      "Klum\u2019s joint peacock costume with her husband, musician Tom Kaulitz, required 15 additional people to navigate. She felt the need to create that more \u201ccomplicated\u201d costume, she told People, because her creepy worm costume in 2022 \u201cfelt so simple.\u201d",

      "Her costume was inspired by the makeover E.T. gets from his young friend Gertie, played by Drew Barrymore, who was just 7 when \u201cE.T.\u201d was released. As in the movie, Klum\u2019s E.T. sported a long blond wig, red lipstick and a black hat and scarf.",

      "On Instagram, Fox revealed why she chose the look for Halloween.",
      "\"I\u2019m dressed as Jackie Kennedy in the pink suit. Not as a costume, but as a statement,\" she said. \"When her husband was assassinated, she refused to change out of her blood-stained clothes, saying, \u2018I want them to see what they\u2019ve done.\u2019 The image of the delicate pink suit splattered with blood is one of the most haunting juxtapositions in modern history.\"",
      "\"Beauty and horror. Poise and devastation. Her decision not to change clothes, even after being encouraged to, was an act of extraordinary bravery,\" Fox continued. \"It was performance, protest, and mourning all at once. A woman weaponizing image and grace to expose brutality. It\u2019s about trauma, power, and how femininity itself is a form of resistance. Long live Jackie O \u2665\ufe0f.\"",
      "Fox wore the outfit at the annual Cursed Amulet Halloween party in New York City.",

      "The National Archives has kept the pink suit preserved in a climate-controlled vault outside of Washington, per The New York Times.",
      "The suit won't be available for public viewing until the year 2103 as to not \"dishonor the memory of Mrs. Kennedy or President Kennedy, or cause any grief or suffering to members of their family,\" according to a deed of the suit from when it was gifted to the National Archives."

      "Anthony Williams, 32, was arrested Saturday after the stabbing incident in which 11 people were injured, including one London North Eastern Railway staff member, who was in life-threatening condition, according to British Transport Police.",
      "Police said they have since charged Williams in connection with four other offenses, including the stabbing of a 14-year-old boy Friday night and the attack of a 17-year-old earlier Saturday, before the train stabbing.",
      "Police on Tuesday afternoon said that a 14-year-old boy was stabbed at 7:10 p.m. Friday in Peterborough's city center on Henry Penn Walk, adding that the boy was taken to the hospital and treated for minor injuries.",
      "The suspect fled the scene, and police, despite the help of a police dog, were not able to find him.",
      "A man with a knife also entered a barber shop in Fletton, an area in Peterborough, at around the same time Friday, police said. It was reported to the Cambridgeshire Constabulary two hours later, but the man had left the shop, so officers were not dispatched.",
      "On Saturday at 12:46 a.m., police received a report that a 17-year-old \"suffered facial injuries after being attacked with a knife\" on a Docklands Light Railway train at the Pontoon Dock station.",

    "story": [
      "Two years ago, Derek and DeAnna Huffman were desperate to leave Humble, a suburb of Houston. Their three daughters, they believed, were being brainwashed by public school and mainstream media to support LGBTQ rights. American culture in general no longer offered white people the same opportunities as other races, they said.",
      "The couple yearned to live in a place that shared their \"Christian values\" and where they \"weren't going to be discriminated against\" as white, politically-conservative Christians.",
      "So in March, the Huffmans became the first family to move to a community planned for fellow English-speakers some 30 miles west of Moscow, a project they had been following online run by long-term American expat and former Kremlin-sponsored RT host Tim Kirby. The family is among a small but growing number of Americans who have moved to Russia because the United States, in their opinion, has become too \u201cwoke.\"",
      "The Russian government has welcomed these culture war refugees. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order offering temporary residence to people wanting to move to the country because they rejected \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of their home countries.",
      "Around 1,500 of these \u201cideological immigrants,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed by the Russian media, including 127 Americans, have applied for temporary residence in Russia, according to the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs.",
      "\"President Putin is an amazing leader and he\u2019s done great things for Russia,\u201d Derek Huffman, 45, said in a video on his family\u2019s YouTube channel on March 9. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like you see on the news.\u201d The social media platform X \u201cis the only place where you get real information\" about America's own problems, Derek says.",
      "The family initially found a community of Russians and westerners on social media who encouraged their move, with donations from some of their 15,000 YouTube subscribers providing financial support after their arrival in Russia. But when Derek Huffman voluntarily joined the Russian army in May, the family became a lightning rod for broader online scrutiny.",
      "Derek Huffman said he joined the Russian army to expedite the family\u2019s applications for Russian citizenship, as well as to show support for their new homeland.",
      "\u201cAbove and beyond the citizenship, the money, a big part of it for me is about the respect and earning our place here in Russia,\u201d he said on the Huffmans\u2019 YouTube channel on May 26.",
      "But in a follow-up video posted in June, which was subsequently deleted, DeAnna Huffman, 42, told viewers that her husband had been \u201cthrown to the wolves.\u201d NBC News viewed a re-upload of the video.",
      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",
      "Pro-Ukrainian commentators, keen to publicize hardship for pro-Russian figures, said on social media that Derek Huffman had been killed. A post on X claiming to have access to drone footage of his death has more than 2 million views. NBC News did not find video to substantiate the claim, and DeAnna Huffman denied the reports.",
      "Derek reappeared in several videos on the family\u2019s YouTube channel uploaded on October 25, celebrating his daughter\u2019s birthday and signing forms to receive his Russian passport.",
      "In one filmed in the family\u2019s neighborhood, he said he was back \u201con vacation\u201d after being deployed for six months, and praised his wife for keeping the family going while he was gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m still alive and doing what I can to survive, and be of service to Russia. I\u2019m so thankful to all the Russian people who have reached out and helped my family while I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Another family, the Hares, also moved from Abilene, Texas, to Russia to shield their three sons from what they say are harmful elements of American culture.",
      "\u201cIt was the promise of a country that would not promote the LGBT agenda. We liked the fact that LGBT is basically outlawed here in official ways,\u201d Leo Hare, 62, told NBC News via a video call from the family\u2019s new home in Ivanovo, Russia.",
      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",
      "The Hares have endured their share of hardship trying to build a new life in Russia.",
      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",
      "Leo Hare thought their troubles were over when their landlord\u2019s son offered a generous interest rate for investing their $50,000 nest egg in what he described as a car import business. But they only saw one payment before he stopped sending them money and refused to return their money, Leo Hare said.",
      "The couple went to the police and the local court to file complaints about their lost money and with their concerns that they had been swindled, but say they have received no help from law enforcement officials. NBC News contacted Domodedovo police for comment but did not receive a reply.",
      "The Hares\u2019 sons, 17, 15, and 12, have had difficulty adapting to life in Russia, and the two older boys want to return to America, according to their father. They feel isolated and are disappointed that school is not an option since Russia requires students to pass a language test to study in public schools.",
      "Leo and Chantelle, who ran a carpet cleaning business and a mobile snack business back in the U.S., are now working as English tutors. They have found an apartment in Ivanovo, northeast of Moscow, and \u201care living really comfortably now.\u201d They are currently homeschooling their children. Leo Hare said it probably \u201cwould have been a dealbreaker\u201d if they knew about the school restrictions.",
      "The Hares have not met the Huffmans.",
      "Leo Hare says he never considered joining the army because of his age and safety concerns, and says that Derek Huffman \u201cassumed a little too much\u201d about life in the Russian military.",
      "\"We assumed a lot, too,\" he admitted. \"But we do have a faith in Christ and He is leading us, even though we\u2019ve made mistakes.\""

      "Showcasing more than 5,300 objects from the young king\u2019s tomb, including his iconic death mask and glittering royal regalia, the new section of the vast museum here on the outskirts of Cairo is expected to draw millions of visitors every year.",
      "The galleries, displaying mostly pieces never seen by the public, were officially opened in an elaborate and long-awaited grand opening ceremony on Saturday in front of delegates from more than 70 countries.",
      "On a behind-the-scenes visit to the museum\u2019s Conservation Center earlier this month, general director Hussein Kamal told NBC News that it will be the first time since Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered over a century ago that all the items are stored in one place.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said, adding that he was particularly excited by the exhibition featuring King Tut\u2019s armor. The piece made from textiles and leather was \u201cunique throughout ancient Egyptian civilization,\u201d he said.",
      "Kamal said the items, previously held in a storeroom, were painstakingly restored since 2017 by some of the center\u2019s 150 conservators.",
      "\u201cWe tried to reshape it from the original,\u201d he said, adding that it was a challenge because they did not have anything to compare it to and had to depend on \u201cinvestigation and analysis to know the original structure of the armor.\u201d",
      "Believed to have become pharaoh when he was 8 or 9 years old, in around 1334 B.C., Tutankhamun ruled until his death 10 years later. He is believed to have suffered from numerous illnesses and disabilities, including circulatory problems, malaria, bone disease and a club foot.",
      "Tutankhamun's tomb was discovered in November 1922 in the Valley of the Kings by the British archaeologist Howard Carter, undisturbed by grave robbers and almost completely intact, nearly 400 miles south of Egypt\u2019s most famous archeological treasures in Giza.",
      "Now the artifacts recovered from that tomb will sit in the largest museum in the world dedicated to a single civilization \u2014 the Grand Egyptian Museum's grounds cover 117 acres, or the equivalent of 80 football fields, just over a mile north of the Great Pyramids of Giza outside Cairo.",
      "The collection also includes the 4,000-year-old funerary boat, also known as the Cheops ship, of Pharaoh Khufu.",
      "At Saturday's grand opening, attended by a number of European and Arab leaders, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi sought to give the event an international scale, calling on attendees to \"make this museum a platform for dialogue, a destination for knowledge, a forum for humanity, and a beacon for all who love life and believe in the value of humankind.\"",
      "With the Great Pyramids and the Sphinx as their backdrop, actors dressed in ancient Egyptian garb paid tribute to thousands of years of history, as an orchestra played fanfares. Hundreds of drones created a light show in the sky, depicting figures including Tutankhamun and ancient Egyptian gods Isis and Osiris.",
      "While the museum will officially open Tuesday, limited tours have been available since 2023, and the public is allowed access to most of its main galleries since October.",
      "Hassan Allam, CEO of the museum's management company, said daily visitor numbers would surge from 6,000 to 15,000 this week as the doors are opened on the \"out of this world\" Tutankhamun Gallery.",
      "He said running the museum had been a \"challenging and yet wonderful experience,\" describing it as a \"great privilege\" to \"play a small role in Egypt's history, maintaining it, managing it, and hosting Egyptology lovers from across the world.\"",
      "Alongside the Tutankhamun exhibition, the museum holds artifacts from the prehistoric era, dating from 700,000 B.C., to the Roman era of the fourth century A.D., arranged around themes of kingship, society and beliefs.",
      "Statues, sarcophagi and stelae also offer a glimpse into the life of Egypt\u2019s ancient elite and how they prepared themselves for the afterlife.",
      "At the museum\u2019s center sits the six-story Grand Staircase with a view of the pyramids and an atrium containing monuments, pharaonic statues and sarcophagi.",
      "The opening ceremony marks the culmination of a project first announced in 1992. Construction officially began in 2005 and has been hit by repeated delays due to the Arab Spring in the early 2010s and the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Ahmed Ezz, the chairman of Ezz Steel, which provided all of the steel rebar needed for the project, said in an interview this week that the museum not only reflects his country\u2019s past but is \u201calso part of an architectural renaissance of Egypt.\u201d",
      "After a \u201cdifficult decade,\u201d Ezz said he hoped the museum would show that his country was \u201cgoing on a more positive trajectory.\u201d"

      "The blocks are concrete \u2014 but little else about Israel's \"yellow line\" appears to be.",
      "Israeli troops have laid yellow blocks down on the ground in Gaza, marking the parts of the Palestinian enclave \u2014 just more than half of the territory \u2014 still under their control as part of the ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Envisioned as a temporary boundary under the first phase of the agreement, which was brokered in part by President Donald Trump, the line has instead become a flashpoint.",
      "Israel carried out days of strikes on Gaza last week despite the truce, killing more than 100 people, including dozens of children, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza, Israel said it was responding to what it said was a Hamas attack that killed one of its soldiers operating within the \"yellow line.\"",

      "The next stages of Trump's plan that would see Israel withdraw further are still to be negotiated.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Monday that he met with senior White House officials to discuss efforts to further implement Trump's 20-point plan. Analysts warned that with the future of the truce appearing to be on \u201cshaky\u201d ground, it could be some time before there is clarity.",
      "NBC News spoke to some Palestinians whose homes, or what's left of them, lie just beyond the barrier. For them, the line has become a physical manifestation of their fears that they may never be able to return to their land.",
      "'I can't even look at it'",
      "The Israel Defense Forces began laying the yellow markers last month in what the military said was an effort to clearly delineate the areas it had agreed to withdraw to under the ceasefire deal with Hamas, which came into effect Oct. 10.",
      "It came after repeated incidents of Israeli forces firing upon Palestinians who they said had approached or crossed the withdrawal boundary, dubbed the \u201cyellow line.\"",
      "In one case last month, the Gaza Civil Defense agency said Israeli forces had killed nine people in a bus. The Israeli military said troops initially fired warning shots at the vehicle, which it said had crossed the boundary, and then \"opened fire to remove the threat\" when the vehicle didn't stop."

      "Hegseth said on X that the boat was targeted in a \"lethal kinetic strike\" in international waters and killed two \u201cnarco-terrorists.\u201d He also included video of the strike in the X post.",

      "\u201cEach person has not only [a] name, but also a fate and a face,\u201d Sima Velkovic, the leader of Yad Vashem\u2019s family roots research team, told NBC News. \u201cWe want to know: Who were these people?\u201d",
      "Between 1941 and 1945, Nazi Germany and its collaborators systematically murdered approximately 6 million Jews across Europe \u2014 about two-thirds of the continent\u2019s Jewish population \u2014 through mass shootings, forced labor, starvation and extermination camps such as Auschwitz. Millions of others, including disabled people and political dissidents, were also killed under Adolf Hitler\u2019s regime.",

      "How they did it",
      "Reaching this milestone was not easy.",
      "\u201cThere never was a list of Holocaust victims,\u201d said Alexander Avram, director of the Hall of Names and the Central Database of Shoah Victims\u2019 Names at Yad Vashem.",
      "\u201cThe Nazis and their collaborators did not issue death certificates. \u2026 In most cases the Jews were just killed or gassed or \u2026 no registration whatsoever,\u201d Avram told NBC News in an interview inside the Hall of Names memorial.",
      "Men, women and even children were shot into unmarked mass graves. At extermination camps, the Nazis burned the remains of Jewish victims in crematoria to hide evidence of genocide.",
      "To reconstruct victims\u2019 identities, Yad Vashem\u2019s researchers have scoured tens of thousands of sources, including archival material.",
      "One of the key sources has been \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d \u2014 biographical fact sheets submitted by survivors and those who knew the victims to preserve their memory.",
      "Each page is vetted carefully, Avram said. Researchers cross-reference submissions with prewar lists and historical events, sometimes requesting additional documentation before accepting a record.",
      "The pages \u201ccan be considered tombstones for the Jews who were assassinated during the Holocaust,\u201d Avram said.",
      "For families like Koza-Culp\u2019s, those pages are far more than data points. \u201cTo now be able to look at that photo and know their names \u2026 and to know a little bit about them, to me, makes them feel real and makes them feel like they mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes them feel like they matter.\u201d",
      "Those names have also reunited branches of a family tree that had been separated for decades.",
      "\u201cThe fabric of our family was ripped apart, and through this \u2026 we\u2019ve stitched it back together a little bit, but \u2026 those scars are kind of always there,\u201d she said.",
      "The race against time",
      "That sentiment drives Yad Vashem\u2019s mission today, as historians race to preserve survivors\u2019 memories while these eyewitnesses to genocide are still alive. Experts estimate that 90% of Holocaust survivors will have died by 2040.",
      "New tools may help. Yad Vashem says artificial intelligence could help researchers scour archival material, possibly helping uncover around 250,000 more names.",
      "But AI cannot track down names that are not in the historical record. Yad Vashem is imploring survivors and their descendants to share their stories now so that the very people Hitler hoped to erase are instead remembered for generations to come.",
      "\u201cThis is the last hour,\u201d warned Avram.",
