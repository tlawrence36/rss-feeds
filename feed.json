      "In a month that\u2019s long been known to let edgier movies thrive, Zach Cregger\u2019s highly anticipated horror film \u201cWeapons\u201d did not disappoint, topping the box office during its debut weekend with $42.5 million domestically from 3,202 theaters. It made $70 million internationally.",
      "The film\u2019s success also handed its distributor, Warner Bros. Pictures, the seventh No. 1 opening of the year, and became the studio\u2019s sixth film in a row to debut with over $40 million domestically.",
      "\u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Disney\u2019s chaotic sequel to the 2003 classic, \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d took the second spot during its premiere weekend, earning $29 million in 3,975 North American theaters. Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis return, this time for a double body-swapping between the mother-daughter duo and Lohan\u2019s teen daughter and soon-to-be stepdaughter.",
      "Viral marketing tactics, coupled with strong social media word-of-mouth, boded well for both films\u2019 success, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore.",
      "\u201cThe top two films could not be more different, and that\u2019s what makes this weekend so appealing for moviegoers,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cBoth are perfectly tailored for their audiences to react in real time over the weekend to these films and then post on social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cWeapons\u201d transports audiences to the small town of Maybrook, where 17 kids up and leave their homes at 2:17 a.m., leaving bewildered parents in their wake. The town is left to navigate the lingering effects of trauma through horror, paranoia and a touch of existential humor.",
      "The film is Cregger\u2019s follow-up to his solo directorial debut with the 2022 genre-bending horror, \u201cBarbarian.\u201d That critically-acclaimed film had a slower start and smaller budget, but still topped the charts during its premiere with $10 million domestically and made a splash in the genre.",
      "\u201cWeapons\u201d generated a lot of buzz for its strong reviews (95% on Rotten Tomatoes).",
      "\u201cThe internet\u2019s exploding right now between Friday and today. You just see that people are having a great time with it,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldstein, president of global distribution for Warner Bros. \u201cIt starts with an exceptional movie, an exceptional marketing campaign, and the date was exceptional too.\u201d",
      "The success of the comedy-horror double premiere meant \u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\u201d surrendered its two-week run in the top spot and landed in the third position, bringing in $15.5 million domestically. The superhero movie enjoyed a strong $118 million debut, but stumbled in its second weekend.",
      "\u201cThe Bad Guys 2,\u201d which got a healthy start at the No. 2 spot during its premiere weekend, came in fourth place, earning $10.4 million domestically. \u201cThe Naked Gun\u201d had a similar fate, reaching the fifth position with $8.4 million in North American theaters.",

      "Warner Bros. started off slow this year, but made a comeback with the box-office hit, \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d which opened with $157 million domestically. Since then, movies like \u201cSinners,\u201d \u201cSuperman\u201d and now, \u201cWeapons,\u201d have found success.",

      "Ryan Speedo Green has taken on the challenging role of Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre\u201d at the Santa Fe Opera House",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The Jemez and Sangre de Cristo mountains had vanished into the night sky by the time Ryan Speedo Green sang his first words as Wotan in Wagner\u2019s \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre.\u201d",
      "Still, their invisible presence around the Santa Fe Opera House was a fitting backdrop, since Wagner set the scene on a high mountain ridge.",
      "And indeed the part of Wotan, one of the most demanding roles in opera for a dramatic bass-baritone, seems to inspire mountain imagery. To conductor James Gaffigan, its length and difficulty make it \u201cthe Mount Everest for this particular voice type.\u201d To Green, \u201cIt feels almost as if this is the pinnacle, the height of roles that you could portray.\u201d",
      "Now, at age 39, Green stands proudly at that pinnacle, if sometimes still shaking his head in disbelief at how far he\u2019s come.",
      "Having survived a troubled childhood that included time in juvenile detention, he found a voice teacher who believed in his gift, honed his skills through years of study and an apprenticeship at the Vienna State Opera, then sang a series of increasingly prominent roles at the Metropolitan Opera to emerge as a full-fledged star.",
      "\u201cI never thought it would happen, that my career would blow up the way it has,\u201d Green said in an interview between performances, which continue through Aug. 21.",
      "The Santa Fe performances are his first time singing \u201cDie Walk\u00fcre,\u201d the second of the four operas in Wagner\u2019s tetralogy and the one with the biggest and most daunting role for the head of the gods.",
      "It calls for a wide dramatic range \u2014 from exuberance, to despair, from fury to compassion. And the vocal challenges include a 24-minute monologue in which Wotan recapitulates the previous events in his life, and a scene at the end of a long evening for which he has to keep his voice fresh as he bids a tender farewell to his disobedient daughter Br\u00fcnnhilde, sung here by soprano Tamara Wilson.",
      "\u201cMy Wotan is still in its infancy and I can see it grow with every performance as I get it more into my blood and into my feet,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m lucky that I\u2019m getting my first whack at it at 39.\u201d",
      "Even in this first outing, his performance drew bravos from the audience and critics.",
      "\u201cGreen \u2026 portrayed the troubled god as if he had been doing it for years,\u201d wrote Harvey Steiman on Seen and Heard International. \u201cSensitive to every singer around him, he delivered one great moment after another in his rich baritone, as silky as it is powerful.\u201d",
      "Green actually made his debut as Wotan last year in a semi-staged production of \u201cDas Rheingold,\u201d the opening \u201cRing\u201d installment at the Los Angeles Philharmonic under conductor Gustavo Dudamel.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment he walked onstage, everyone sensed his God-like presence,\u201d Dudamel said in an email to the AP. \u201cWhen he sings, the colors and richness of his voice wash over you, and the sound completely surrounds you.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen I sang my first Wotan, it was the first time I played a character who doesn\u2019t have to worry about what anybody else thinks of him.\u201d",
      "Green will perform the \u201cWalk\u00fcre\u201d Wotan again next spring with Dudamel and the LA Philharmonic and will play Wotan in a new \u201cRing\u201d cycle at the Metropolitan Opera set to launch in the 2027-28 season, Met General Manager Peter Gelb told the AP.",
      "Among his colleagues, Green is known for his relentless work ethic and perfectionism.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s extremely hard on himself,\u201d said Gaffigan, who is conducting the Santa Fe performances and recalled the first time he heard from Green after he was cast.",
      "\u201cHe called me to start discussing the role before he even got to Santa Fe,\u201d Gaffigan said, \u201cAnd from the first words on the telephone, he said, \u2018I want an hour for Act 2 and an hour for Act 3, can you give me that?\u2019 \u2026 I knew this guy was really serious and he wouldn\u2019t give up on getting this time.",
      "\u201cThe dedication to the text and the music and the rhythms is at the highest level of preparation I\u2019ve heard in a long time,\u201d Gaffigan added. \u201cHe knows how serious this is. It\u2019s a major ascent in his career.\u201d",
      "Green laughs when reminded of that phone call and mentions how he had prepared for his first Wagner role more than a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt was the Second Knight in \u2018Parsifal\u2019 ... and I was rehearsing for three months for a role that literally has 61 seconds of music,\u201d Green said..",
      "\u201cI was like, this is at the Met, I need to be perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of mentality has been my saving grace, because I put everything I\u2019ve got into it, vocally, physically, mentally.\u201d",

      "Kristin Scott Thomas draws on her own childhood losses for her directorial debut \u201cMy Mother's Wedding.\u201d",
      "Before Kristin Scott Thomas turned 12, she lost her father and stepfather. Both were Royal Navy pilots who died in crashes. The first happened when she was 5. The second at age 11. Thomas uses these facts, a kind of origin story, as the basis for her directorial debut, \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a comedic drama about family, trauma and getting on with it that opens in theaters Friday.",
      "Knowing that the story comes from a real place is important for the experience. It gives \u201cMy Mother\u2019s Wedding,\u201d a perfectly average film that doesn\u2019t quite land the way it should, an emotional depth that it\u2019s otherwise lacking. This is a strange shortcoming considering the caliber of the cast, including Thomas as the bride to be, and Sienna Miller, Emily Beecham and Scarlett Johansson as her daughters. But it\u2019s a cruel reminder that a good hook, talented actors, one killer monologue and a picturesque setting (in this case, the English countryside) aren\u2019t guarantees that a movie will work.",
      "In the film, the deaths may be in the distant past, but they continue to haunt Diana\u2019s (Thomas) adult daughters as she prepares to marry another. Diana\u2019s new man is not a dashing pilot, forever preserved in handsome youth. Geoffrey (James Fleet) is very gray. He likes to talk about birds, ospreys in particular, has never had children and comes with a very silly last name (Loveglove) that she plans to take. Her girls are not exactly impressed, though they\u2019ve all got their own stuff to deal with.",
      "It should be said that Johansson is indeed playing a British woman in this film, and while I don't feel qualified to comment on the nuances of her accent, all I can say is that there is a consistently strange disconnect to hear it coming out of her mouth. Johansson is a great actor who I\u2019ve believed in many wilder roles, from Marvel movies right on down to her Ellen Greene riff during \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d 50th anniversary show. But, somehow, she\u2019s hard to buy as Katherine Frost: A British, lesbian Royal Navy officer in a longtime relationship with a woman named Jack (played by fellow beauty Freida Pinto).",
      "Miller\u2019s character is Victoria, a Hollywood actor known for franchise dreck (no one can remember whether the latest \u201cDame Of Darkness\u201d is the fourth or fifth in the series) and short-lived relationships. And Beecham is the youngest Georgina, a nurse who suspects that her husband is having an affair. To find out, the girls hire a private detective to surveil her house and show them the footage after the wedding.",
      "It's a very busy, fraught weekend for everyone. There\u2019s lots of fretting over why Katherine won\u2019t marry Jack, and why Victoria is dancing around a relationship with a wealthy, older French man when her childhood crush still pines for her. There\u2019s lingering anxiety about their mom marrying this man who seems so unlike the two heroes that came before and much discussion about the importance of last names, marriage and making sure kids feel like they belong to someone. Some things get resolved, but it's hard to shake the feeling that everyone might need a new therapist by the end.",

      "In Starz's \u201cOutlander,\u201d Caitriona Balfe's Claire Fraser is bold and brave. She can also think on her feet in high-pressure moments. Her husband Jamie Fraser, played by Sam Heughan, is protective and empathetic. In a new prequel series out Friday, called \u201cOutlander: Blood of My Blood,\u201d we see how they each got that way.",
      "\u201cBlood of My Blood\u201d tells the love story of Jamie's parents, Ellen and Brian, and Claire's parents, Julia and Henry. The characters are inspired by the stories of Diana Gabaldon but there are no novels for showrunner Matthew B. Roberts to follow. He also is the showrunner of the original series, which debuts its final season early next year.",
      "With no source material \u201cthere\u2019s a lot more room to play in,\" explained Roberts. In \u201cOutlander,\u201d \"there are all these tentpole moments that we have to write to because that\u2019s what our audience wants from the books.\u201d",
      "In the books, Gabaldon mentions Jamie's parents in \u201cbreadcrumbs\u201d said Roberts. \u201cWe stick to those, but the freedom is what can we do after that to get to essentially where 'Outlander' begins.\u201d",
      "The big obstacle facing Jamie\u2019s parents, Ellen and Brian, who meet in 18th century Scotland \u2014 is that they come from families that \u201cdon\u2019t get on,\u201d said Harriet Slater, who plays Ellen. \u201cThey don\u2019t mix. It\u2019s completely forbidden. My father\u2019s worst enemy was Brian\u2019s father so I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have had some strong words to say about the whole thing.\u201d",

There's the \u201ctough, stoic, Highland warrior\u201d who he says \u201crides around on horses and swings swords and stuff.\u201d Then there's this \u201clovely, gentle, poetic, romantic guy who wants nothing more than to take care of other people.\u201d",
      "A few months ago Roy went back and rewatched episodes from season one of \u201cOutlander,\u201d because he wanted to watch Heughan as his TV son.",

      "\u201cWhen we meet him, he\u2019s pretty much given up,\" said Jeremy Irvine, who plays Henry. \u201cI think he\u2019s accepted death really and doesn\u2019t have anything to live for and sends this one last lifeline out in the form of an open letter back to England.\u201d Julia finds his letter at work and feels compelled to respond. The two end up falling in love while writing back-and-forth.",
      "A series of events send Julia and Henry, like their daughter, back in time. They end up in the 1700s where Irvine explains they are \u201ctrying to live second by second.\u201d",

      "Palmieri dabbled in tropical music as a pianist during the 1950s with the Eddie Forrester Orchestra. He later joined Johnny Segu\u00ed\u2019s band and Tito Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s before forming his own band in 1961, La Perfecta, alongside trombonist Barry Rogers and singer Ismael Quintana.",

      "NEW YORK (RNS) \u2014 On Sunday mornings in Brooklyn, nicknamed the borough of churches, the muffled sounds of choir singers, hand\u2011claps and Hammond organs can be heard from the sidewalks. The borough still has a church on nearly every block, but over the years, the number of people in the pews has thinned.",
      "Many church choirs in the heart of Brooklyn, however, have kept singing \u2014 despite boasting fewer singers than in years past as neighborhoods face gentrification and organized religious affiliation decreases.",
      "Standing in front of the gospel choir at Concord Baptist Church of Christ in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Jessica Howard, 25, led the gospel standard \u201cGod Is\u201d on a Sunday in July. Dressed in a powder-pink floral dress, she called out lines naming God as \u201cjoy in sorrow\u201d and \u201cstrength for tomorrow.\u201d Some choir members wiped away tears as the song stoked emotions from around the room.'",
      "As a Black Christian person, as a descendant of slaves, I think when I sing, I feel really connected to my ancestors,\u201d said Howard, who grew up in Virginia and now sings as a soloist at Concord, where she\u2019s been a congregant for six years. \u201cI really feel sometimes like it\u2019s not just me singing, it\u2019s my lineage singing.\u201d",

      "Founded in 1847, Concord Baptist Church is Brooklyn\u2019s oldest historically Black congregation. At the time, a nearby neighborhood known as Weeksville, now considered part of central Brooklyn, was the second-largest free Black community in the United States before the Civil War, said Amanda Henderson, collections historian at the Weeksville Heritage Center.",
      "Louise Nelson, a Brooklyn native and church historian of the Berean Baptist Church in Crown Heights, said music was the foundation of the early church, and that remains true for churches in the borough today.",
      "\"The songs that uplifted us and kept us going through the midst of our misery \u2014 music is who we are,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have a church today without the music because it brings unity in that idea that we can all do it together.\u201d",
      "According to Pew Research Center data, between 2019 and 2023, Black Protestant monthly church attendance fell from 61% to 46% \u2014 the largest decline among major U.S. religious groups. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend, and its impact is visible in the thinning choir stands.",
      "Glenn McMillan, Concord\u2019s director of music ministry and a musicology teacher at the City University of New York, who has worked in New York City church choirs since 1994, recalls a time when historically Black churches in Brooklyn regularly had multiple choirs at each parish.",
      "\u201cIn the last 20 years, the members of church choirs started getting older because this generation does not see church as important as it was back in the day,\u201d McMillan said. The choir at Concord has shrunk from about 50 voices before the pandemic to 30 today, McMillan said. Back in 2006, the choir featured 100 voices.",
      "According to research published by covidreligionresearch.org in June, Black Protestants attended church on Zoom more than other denominations during the pandemic, and they have been the slowest to return to in\u2011person worship.",
      "\u201cThe internet has taken over and streaming has taken over,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t goin to the building as much as they are streaming it.\u201d",
      "McMillan said that when in-person services first resumed, it took a long time for the choir to rebuild because many members were still staying home for health reasons. Recently, though, he\u2019s seen more people showing up.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m begging people my age to come to Concord,\u201d said Howard, the youngest member of the gospel choir, adding that only a handful of people around her age attend the church.",

      "Today, Davis said, a typical service attracts approximately 150 people, and roughly 100 virtually. Over time, Berean\u2019s choirs have consolidated into a single mass choir with approximately 20 singers.",
      "A professional soloist who has been singing at different churches across Brooklyn throughout her adult life, Davis said she believes one reason for choirs thinning out is the decline of music education in New York City Public Schools.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in high school, I had music every day,\u201d said Davis, who attended high school in the 1970s in central Brooklyn. \u201cI don\u2019t think the children are learning notes and sharps and clefs. I mean, that was like general knowledge for us at the time.\u201d",
      "During the 1970s fiscal crisis, the city of New York eliminated thousands of teaching positions, including art and music teachers, and converted music rooms into other classrooms, narrowing arts access in schools in low-income and majority-Black neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cFor me, singing is not just singing, it\u2019s ministry,\u201d Davis said. \u201cSome of these old hymns were composed years and years ago, and those old hymns have sustained a people \u2014 many people.\u201d",
      "Gentrification is another force reshaping Brooklyn. Between 2010 and 2020, Crown Heights lost nearly 19,000 Black residents while gaining about 15,000 whites, according to 2020 Census data. More than 75% of Bedford-Stuyvesant residents in 2000 were Black, while in 2020, around 41% were Black.",
      "Those demographic shifts have hit historically Black Catholic parishes hard. St. Teresa of Avilain Crown Heights, which was the first church in the nation to hold Mass in Creole, will close by the end of the year. The anticipated closure demonstrates a wider pattern of Catholic churches that serve people of color closing, often attributed to declining attendance.",
      "For Mike Delouis, 38, St. Teresa\u2019s longtime cantor and a son of Haitian immigrants who was baptized at the church, the loss is personal.",
      "\u201cSinging for me is not about performance but about participation,\u201d said Delouis, who juggles three services most Sundays between St. Teresa and the Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights. \u201cSt. Augustine said singing is praying twice.\u201d",
      "Delouis is part of a group fighting to keep the parish open, hoping to preserve a piece of their history in a rapidly changing Brooklyn. \u201cEven through the process of gentrification, there are people that hear the music and they come in,\u201d he said.",
      "In June, from his place in the choir loft, Delouis heard the priest announce the church\u2019s closure. The words hit hard. \u201cIt was actually kind of hard to finish,\u201d he said. \u201cWe only had the closing hymn to do, and I thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, no \u2014 we can\u2019t let this happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "Jesteena Walters, 55, has been part of Bedford Central Presbyterian Church in Crown Heights since she was an infant. She began singing at age 6 in the junior choir, and when she turned 18, she transitioned to its Gratitude choir, which her older siblings also joined. \u201cIt was the young hip gospel choir of the church,\u201d Walters said.",
      "Today, Gratitude no longer exists in the same way. Its members are older and often reunite only for special occasions, such as singing at funerals. Over the decades, Walters has also watched the congregation itself shift demographics.",
      "\"When I first went to Bedford Central, it was primarily a white church, and so we were in the minority at the time,\u201d Walters said, referring to the early 1970s. \u201cIn the years that would come, itwas primarily a Black church.\u201d It later became home to a large West Indian population, and today includes many members of Guyanese heritage.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I couldn\u2019t break down the history of Brooklyn in a way that says who came first,\u201d Walters said. \u201cAt the end of the day, I believe in people coming together, if we can truly connect, feel each other\u2019s pain and celebrate each other\u2019s joys.\u201d",
      "McMillan emphasized that choirs continue to play a central role in Black church life, even as congregations decline in membership. \u201cChoir singers are some of the most faithful churchgoers,\u201d McMillan said. \u201cA choir is a community within the church community, and whenever you have a really consistent and strong choir, they grow with one another.\u201d",
      "Howard said she hopes to become a choir director one day, and she credits McMillan and the gospel choir for encouraging her toward the role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to follow in that tradition,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cThe baggy jeans, different pops of pink and the chrome shades \u2014 it\u2019s easy to go anywhere and be able to find things that fit into that niche. Throwing it together is easier than throwing together a full vintage outfit.\u201d",
      "One reason for the Y2K resurgence is a 20-year cycle often seen in fashion history, experts say. (Y2K is short for the year 2000.)",
      "\u201cPrior to Y2K styles being back, we saw a lot of \u201990s styles being back,\u201d New York City-based fashion historian Emma McClendon said.",
      "Lauren Downing Peters, an associate professor of fashion studies at Columbia College Chicago, said the Y2K resurgence could be a result of boomers downsizing their homes and purging their millennial children\u2019s old belongings.",
      "\u201cThe 20-year duration is just long enough for a younger generation to be able to find the fashions of their parents\u2019 generation, something that they can remember but only in the abstract, as quaint or interesting and kind of available for reinterpretation and adoption in their 20s,\" she said.",
      "In addition, both experts drew parallels between the political and social dynamics of the two decades, such as technology booms and catastrophic events.",
      "\u201cAt the start of the 2000s we had 9/11, we had a restructuring of how people thought about the world, how people thought about themselves, how people thought about politics,\u201d McClendon said. \u201cI think the global pandemic can be a really interesting comparative to that restructuring.\u201d",
      "The growth of the internet and social media in the 2000s mirrors the development of artificial intelligence today, she said. At the same time, the 2000s may represent a time relatively free of social media and interconnectivity, which could appeal to Gen Z, who have grown up in the age of the internet.",
      "\u201dThat is kind of the appeal behind vintage-inspired fashion trends \u2014 this idea that things were better back then,\" she said.",
      "Jocelyn Brown, who owns the online resale shop Arkival Storehouse, earns a living off this nostalgia by purchasing vintage clothes from thrift stores and antique malls, upcycling them and reselling them online.",
      "Anyone trying to turn a profit on old clothes, she said, can use online channels and apps like Depop, Poshmark, ThredUp, TikTok and Instagram to sell and trade. Brown also suggests selling at flea markets.",

      "Zach Cregger says he had to stop writing jokes while creating his latest horror film, \u201cWeapons,\" and instead let the hyper realistic aftermath of tragedy drive the movie's humor",
      "LOS ANGELES -- If there\u2019s one thing Zach Cregger learned while writing and directing his upcoming horror movie \u201cWeapons,\u201d it\u2019s that the best laughs won\u2019t come from the jokes he writes.",
      "The film follows Cregger\u2019s 2022 solo directorial debut \u201cBarbarians,\u201d the widely celebrated genre-bending horror. This time, the young director bends even more, spinning a town into chaos when all children but one from the same classroom mysteriously vanish, leaving a trail of questions in their place.",
      "The Warner Bros. release hits theaters Friday and is as creepy as it is hilarious \u2014 a delicate balance that required Cregger to strip any intentionality behind his humor, he told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIf the humor is coming from an authentic reaction that a character\u2019s having, then it works,\u201d Cregger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of jokes that didn\u2019t make it into the movie that I thought were going to be so funny. And then we did a test screening, and nobody laughed and I\u2019m like, OK, it\u2019s gotta go.\u201d",
      "Paranoia runs deep in the film. The town's heartbroken parents are represented by Josh Brolin\u2019s character, Archer, whose son was among the missing. The students\u2019 teacher, played by Julia Garner, is determined to solve the mystery, despite parents blaming her for the disappearances.",
      "The humor here comes naturally, Cregger said, as characters navigate the absurd events happening around them.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not playing for the laugh, otherwise you lose the laugh,\u201d said Brolin, whose character stumbles through his grief, a state ripe for what he called genuine and \u201cembarrassingly funny\u201d moments.",
      "If 17 kids up and ran out of their homes at 2:17 a.m. one morning with no trace, what would a community do? That question drove \u201cWeapons,\u201d painting a picture of a town left reeling by the mystery.",
      "The film setting \u2014 the fictional small town of Maybrook, Illinois \u2014 is just as integral to the plot as any of its main characters. The town feels hyper realistic, a core tenet to the movie\u2019s ability to blend humor and horror, two genres that Garner said are \u201copposite side of the same coin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because this isn\u2019t even like a proper horror film,\u201d Garner said. \u201cIt has comedic elements and has horror elements, but it\u2019s kind of its own genre, in a way.\u201d",
      "The town\u2019s reactions to tragedy and shock was intentionally meant to feel oddly realistic, Cregger said. Parents are outraged, storming into town halls and angrily demanding answers from the police, the school and, most pointedly, the students\u2019 teacher. Yet, when Garner\u2019s character is attacked in broad daylight, bystanders and store owners hardly bat an eye, a level of indifference that Cregger said is just as realistic as the parental outrage.",

      "The movie subtly mocks suburban life, as goriness and horror occur under the sights of nosy neighbors, corrupt police departments and struggling relationships.",

Gandy, the schoolteacher, is harassed by parents for her missing students, but is secretly battling alcoholism. Archer, the heartbroken father, is failing in his job and his marriage as he navigates his son\u2019s absence. Paul Morgan, played by Alden Ehrenreich, is a local beat police officer with secrets of his own.",
      "\u201cEvery character is perceived in a certain way and then every character breaks,\u201d Brolin said. \u201cIt all comes down to this very base thing: What if you lost the thing that you value the most? How do you deal?\u201d",
      "For Ehrenreich, who\u2019s found success in dramas, notably as a young Han Solo, \u201cWeapons\u201d offered a different pace, but its horror wasn\u2019t what drew him in. Rather, he was captivated by the film\u2019s depth and weirdness.",
      "\u201cThe weird resonance, the weird opening voice-over, the way it was written and the kind of emotional brokenness of these characters and the depth that I felt was in the writing, that was as deep as any drama I\u2019ve read in years,\u201d Ehrenreich said.",

      "The body-swappers are back",
      "It\u2019s a tale as old as time \u2014 or at least, a tale Hollywood loves to tell again and again: Body-swapping. It\u2019s magical. It\u2019s comical. It carries heartwarming messages about walking in another\u2019s shoes, and learning about oneself along the way.",
      "So it\u2019s hardly surprising that \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d the 2003 version of the 1972 Mary Rodgers novel starring Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, was a hit. Lohan was endearing and charismatic as an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager, and Curtis was a comic hoot as her control-freak therapist mom.",
      "And while there were a few misfires \u2014 the stereotypical Asian representation has aged badly \u2014 the film was powered by an easy chemistry between the two stars. So why not revisit the story in 2025? Sequels are often made for far less compelling reasons.",
      "The chief weakness of \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d \u2014 which brings Curtis and Lohan back for an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante. The comedy is thus a bit more manic, and the plot machinations more overwrought (or sometimes distractingly silly).",
      "Then there's the double body-swapping. Because one major swap isn't enough, here we have two sets of swappers \u2014 a quixotic quartet of lives disrupted during the lead-up to, yes, another wedding! The problem is that sometimes, it\u2019s actually hard to keep track of who\u2019s inhabiting whom, and therefore why they're doing what.",
      "Not to say that \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d directed with gusto by Nisha Ganatra, doesn't have moments of comic glee. I\u2019ll admit to laughing out loud \u2014 with everyone else older than 30 near me \u2014 when two teens were trying to locate an adult contact and one of them pulled up Facebook, explaining: \u201cIt\u2019s like a database of old people!\u201d Touch\u00e9, guys.",
      "These \u201cyoungsters\u201d are actually Lohan and Curtis, playing ninth-graders trapped in adult bodies. Before we get to that, though: We begin 22 years after we last saw Lohan\u2019s Anna, playing electric guitar at her mom's wedding. Now a single mom herself with a job managing a young pop star, she's trying to get her daughter up for school. Harper (the excellent Julia Butters) is \u2014 surprise! \u2014 an appealing, mildly turbulent teenager. And just like Anna two decades ago, she keeps people out of her bedroom. \u201cPrepare to be triggered!\u201d Anna yells before barging in. (The dialogue has been duly updated to the present time.)",
      "Driving to school drop-off, Anna is joined by her mom, Tess (Curtis), who has stylish gray hair now and is still a practicing therapist, podcaster and author whose latest topic is \u201cRebelling with Respect.\u201d Dropping Harper off, Anna calls out \u201cMake good choices!\u201d \u2014 just what mom Tess used to say, natch.",
      "At school, Harper butts heads with transfer student Lily (Sophia Hammons), a budding fashion designer who hails from Britain and is very snooty. Anna is called to see the principal. There, she meets Lily\u2019s dishy chef dad Eric (Manny Jacinto), and the two flirt so intensely, the principal herself makes them a dinner reservation.",
      "All it takes is one cute dating montage, and poof, Anna and Eric are engaged. But things are still bad between Harper and Lily, whose animosity triggers a weirdly violent, all-school food fight on bake sale day. But they all have a bachelorette party to attend. There, a wacky fortune-teller and barista and business-card maker \u2014 Vanessa Bayer, in a cameo that perhaps, no definitely goes on too long \u2014 reads their palms. And then the earth starts shaking.",
      "\u201cFreaky\u201d fans know what happens next. The four awaken the next morning, each inhabiting someone else. Anna is Harper. Tess is Lily. Harper is Anna. Lily is Tess. We\u2019ll be testing you on this later!",

Harper, in Anna\u2019s body, goes to a pre-wedding tango lesson with Eric, with disastrous results.

    "story": [
      "Reusable menstrual products, including cups, discs and period underwear, have gained traction as a cost-effective, long-lasting, environmental alternative to single-use products",
      "It was six months ago that Selin Celikoyar bought her last tampon and switched to a reusable menstrual disc.",
      "\"I had already been wary of tampons from an environmental perspective and also from a biological perspective. I felt that they were very wasteful and expensive to consistently keep buying,\" she said.",
      "The flexible discs and other reusable menstrual products are gaining traction as alternatives to the billions of single-use pads and tampons that get tossed into landfills every year. Products such as the discs, silicone cups and period underwear can be reused for years, so they\u2019re cost-effective and long-lasting in addition to helping people reduce waste. The popularity of the reusable alternatives has grown since the pandemic, when it was easier to experiment with period products in the privacy of a home bathroom, according to women's health experts.",
      "Celikoyar said she used tampons and pads for years because those are the options she grew up knowing about. But when she saw her friend make the switch to a menstrual disc, she decided to try it too.",
      "\u201cThe experience has been such a game changer,\u201d she said.",
      "About 12 billion disposable pads and 7 billion tampons go into U.S. landfills every year, according to Dr. Luwam Semere, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara. Pads are mostly plastic. Once they're in the landfill, they take up to 800 years to degrade, according to the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Single-use pads and tampons are by far the most popular period products. Women's health expert Dr. Navya Mysore said that's not because they're better, they're just usually the first options kids are shown.",
      "\u201cIt was often like, \u2018What did your mom use? What did your grandma use?\u2019 And that\u2019s how you were introduced into period hygiene,\u201d said Mysore, a primary care physician based in New York City.",
      "The most popular is the menstrual cup, which gets inserted much like a tampon. The discs get inserted farther in, so they don't interrupt intercourse. Both can hold several times more than a tampon and can stay inserted for up to 12 hours, instead of the four to eight hours recommended for tampons. Semere also said the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome commonly associated with tampons is much lower with menstrual cups and discs.",
      "The cons? The products require some technique to put them in right, and doing it wrong can get messy. The cups and discs also have to be cleaned regularly with soap and water.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do that if you\u2019re at work and you\u2019re in a shared, public restroom. It\u2019s not the most convenient,\u201d said Mysore.",
      "Cups prevent leakage by creating a suction, so people who use intrauterine devices for contraception risk dislodging them if they pull out a menstrual cup without breaking the seal.",
      "The placement of discs, which don\u2019t use suction, can also take some getting used to.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high up there, you don\u2019t feel it, but it can be sometimes harder for women to pull them out,\u201d said Dr. Annemieke van Eijk, an epidemiologist with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s an ease of use there for the modern woman that is significantly better than traditional methods,\u201d she said.",
      "Menstrual cups and discs typically cost between $15 and $40 and come in different shapes and sizes. They're available online and at pharmacies and big box stores.",
      "\u201cIdeally, you would like to experiment a bit with what type of cup works best for you. And the cost can be kind of prohibitive to do that,\u201d van Eijk said.",
      "A reusable product can help save money over the long term. Celikoyar estimates that she was using three tampons every day for seven days, or about 20 per month. With tampons costing 20 to 25 cents each, someone who switched to a reusable product would likely break even after a few months.",
      "For people who prefer pads, the most common reusable option is period underwear, which is comparable to regular-looking underwear with an extra absorbent lining.",
      "\u201cThose are nice because we do see people getting irritation from pad use,\" said Semere. \"Because of the different materials that are in the disposable pads.\u201d",
      "The downside, just like with pads, is the inability to tell when it's absorbed all that it can.",
      "Mysore said that's why some of her patients use the underwear as a backup, and pair them cups, discs or tampons.",

But his court nominees will have lifetime appointments and be in position to roll back abortion access long after the Republican president leaves the White House.",

      "\u2014 Whitney Hermandorfer, who has been confirmed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, has built much of her relatively short career as a lawyer around challenging former President Joe Biden\u2019s policies related to abortion and transgender rights. She challenged a federal law requiring employers to provide workers with reasonable accommodations to get abortion care, as well as Title X regulations that required providers who receive funding through the program to give information about abortions to patients if asked.",
      "Hermandorfer defended Tennessee\u2019s abortion ban, one of the strictest in the country, in court and tried to dismiss a lawsuit from doctors seeking clarification on exemptions to the ban. She said abortion deserves special scrutiny because \u201cthis is the only medical procedure that terminates a life.\u201d",
      "\u2014 Maria Lanahan, a district court nominee in Missouri, helped write the state's complaint in a lawsuit that had sweeping national implications for access to medication abortion. The case challenged the FDA approval of the abortion pill mifepristone despite decades of evidence showing the drug is safe and effective.",
      "The lawyer supported Missouri's effort to strip Planned Parenthood of state Medicaid funding and defended the state's abortion ban after a group of clergy sued, arguing it violated the state constitution\u2019s protections for religious freedom.",
      "\u2014 Jordan Pratt, a nominee for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, called abortion a \u201cbarbaric practice\u201d and \u201cone of the most severe invasions of personal rights imaginable\u201d in an amicus brief supporting Florida's 15-week abortion ban. The state now bans the procedure at six weeks.",
      "In 2025, Pratt struck down a Florida law that created a judicial waiver program for minors seeking to have abortions without parental consent. The lawyer also worked for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that opposes abortion and has sued to reverse the FDA approval of mifepristone.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The mother of the man who killed four people at a Manhattan office tower home to the NFL told 911 dispatchers during a 2022 incident when he threatened to kill himself that he suffered from a sports-related concussion and other issues, new information released by Las Vegas police Tuesday revealed.",
      "Shane Tamura, 27, had a documented history of mental health problems and carried a handwritten note in his wallet when he carried out the shooting that claimed he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known at CTE, investigators said. He fatally shot three people in the building lobby before taking an elevator to the 33rd floor, killing a fourth victim and then ending his own life, according to police.",
      "He accused the football league of hiding the dangers of brain injuries linked to contact sports. Tamura didn\u2019t play professional football but played during his high school years in Southern California, where he grew up.",
      "His mother told the dispatchers on Sept. 12, 2022, that her son was under a doctor's care for \"depression, concussion like sports concussion, chronic migraines, and insomnia.\" She also said he was taking sleeping pills, smoking marijuana, and kept a gun in his backpack. It was one of two incidents that led to Tamura being admitted to hospitals for mental health crises.",
      "\u201cHe said he\u2019s going to kill himself,\u201d she said in the recorded 911 call. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say he made a plan, he just said he just can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d",
      "Tamura\u2019s mother placed the call from outside a Budget Suites Motel. She told dispatchers she would wait in the stairwell because she did not want Tamura to know she had called the police.",
      "\u201cHe just started crying and slamming things and said I\u2019m making him worse, so I said, \u2018I\u2019ll step outside,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be upset, but I\u2019m afraid to leave.\u201d",
      "Tamura was committed to a hospital again in 2024 after calling his mother and making statements about wanting to hurt himself, according to a first responder captured on body camera video released by Las Vegas police.",

      "His psychiatric history would not have prevented him from legally purchasing the revolver, unless relatives or law enforcement sought a so-called extreme risk protection order from the courts. However, a new state law effective this month will allow officers to confiscate firearms in the immediate vicinity of someone placed on a mental health crisis hold.",
      "Las Vegas police also released records Tuesday related to two other run-ins with the law. Tamura was arrested for trespassing at a casino in 2023, where he became agitated after he was asked to show his ID to collect his winnings and was asked to leave when he refused to. He was also cited for driving an unregistered car and without a license in 2024.",

      "It has become such common advice that few question it. But rather than inspirational, it can feel like a burden. How do I go about finding this and what if I never do?",
      "This is \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d \u2014 the gnawing sense that one\u2019s life should have an overarching purpose, but it\u2019s unclear how to discover it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commands to find purpose, but not a lot of support to find purpose,\u201d said Michael Steger, a professor at Colorado State University and director of its Center for Meaning and Purpose.",
      "The definition of purpose can be elastic. Can you have only one purpose or can you have many? Does it have to involve service to others or can it be something that consistently gives only you great pleasure and meaning?",
      "Think of purpose not as something that governs behavior but as a compass you can choose to follow, helping direct your energies toward a central life aim, says Todd Kashdan, a professor at George Mason University and founder of its Well-Being Laboratory. A sense of purpose can help \u201cclose that gap between who you are and what you ideally want to become,\u201d he said.",
      "People can lead content, meaningful lives without ever articulating a sense of purpose, he emphasized.",
      "There are many legitimate reasons for the advice given by parents, teachers, mentors and an array of online gurus that finding purpose is key to a good life. Research has shown that people who more strongly feel a sense of purpose tend to be physically and mentally healthier.",
      "But the word has become so weighty that finding a purpose has, for many, become a source of angst.",
      "The term \u201cpurpose anxiety\u201d appears to have been coined in 2014 by a University of Pennsylvania graduate student, Larissa Rainey, and caught on. Author Elizabeth Gilbert, for example, best known for her memoir \u201cEat, Pray, Love,\u201d has spoken frequently about an unhealthy obsession over a \u201cpurposeful life.\u201d It is, she said in one interview, \u201cthe formula we\u2019ve all been fed.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut a lot of the places that we\u2019ve naturally found meaning in our culture in, say, the last hundred years are falling away.\u201d",
      "Religion, for instance, often offered purpose and meaning to believers. But those who identify as religious has dropped significantly over the years (although that appears to be leveling off recently according to a 2025 survey by the Pew Research Center).",
      "Other people traditionally found purpose in ensuring that their children had a better life than they did. Many don\u2019t have confidence that will be the case anymore, Day said.",
      "As Steger said, \u201cnow we\u2019re stuck trying to do the harder thing, which is, one by one, figure out everything in the universe and how we fit.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- So-called mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and now scientists are using that Nobel Prize-winning technology to try to develop vaccines and treatments against a long list of diseases including cancer and cystic fibrosis.",
      "But this week, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, canceled $500 million in government-funded research projects to create new mRNA vaccines against respiratory illnesses that might trigger another health emergency.",
      "That dismays infectious disease experts who note that mRNA allows faster production of shots than older vaccine-production methods, buying precious time if another pandemic were to emerge.",
      "Using older technology to target a pandemic flu strain would take 18 months to \u201cmake enough vaccine to vaccinate only about one-fourth of the world,\" said Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota, an expert on pandemic preparation. But using mRNA technology \u201ccould change that dramatically, such that by the end of the first year, we could vaccinate the world.\u201d",
      "Traditionally, making vaccines required growing viruses or pieces of viruses called proteins \u2014 often in giant vats of cells or, like most flu shots, in chicken eggs \u2014 and then purifying them. Injecting a small dose as a vaccine trains the body how to recognize when a real infection hits so it's ready to fight back.",
      "But that technology takes a long time. Using mRNA is a faster process.",
      "The \u201cm\u201d stands for messenger, meaning mRNA carries instructions for our bodies to make proteins. Scientists figured out how to harness that natural process by making mRNA in a lab.",

      "Three new studies highlight the severe health impacts of recent wildfires on Maui and in Los Angeles",
      "NEW YORK -- The toll of wildfires is usually counted in acres burnt, property destroyed and lives lost to smoke and flames. But three studies published Wednesday suggest the cost to human health from the Maui and Los Angeles wildfires was substantially higher.",
      "Two of the papers explore what happened after the Hawaii fire in August 2023 \u2014 one of the deadliest U.S. wildfires in a century. A third looks at the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year.",
      "The Maui fire was directly blamed for more than 100 deaths. But it also left 1 in 5 with lung damage and as many as half with symptoms of depression, the new research found. The month of the fire saw 13 suicide and overdose deaths, translating to nearly double the normal suicide and overdose death rates.",
      "The study of the Los Angeles fires concluded that in addition to at least 30 deaths attributed to the fire, more than 400 other deaths could be blamed on the event, due to interruptions in health care and other factors.",
      "The studies, published in two American Medical Association journals, add \"a really important piece to the understanding of the true health risks from these extreme climatic events,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, a University of Wisconsin environmental public health researcher who was not involved in the papers.",
      "The results conform with existing understanding of the effects of extreme weather events, some experts said.",
      "How to track the indirect impacts of disastrous events has been a continuing subject of academic research and even legislative proposals. There have been estimates of deaths caused by extreme heat, as well as research into the large-scale toll of wildfires driven by climate change.",
      "\u201cBut this hones in, especially on (specific) fires,\u201d Patz said.",
      "One of the studies, co-led by Ruben Juarez of the University of Hawaii, looked at more than 1,100 adults six to 14 months after the Maui fire. It found lower lung function in people in areas close to the fire compared with those in lower-exposure areas. Overall, about 22% had below-normal lung function.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a stark reminder that wildfires can leave an invisible but lasting scar on respiratory health, long after the flames are gone,\u201d Juarez said, in an email, noting that this Friday marks the two-year anniversary of the fire.",
      "Patz called the finding \u201can important new contribution.\u201d",
      "Kristie Ebi of the University of Washington echoed that, noting that there is a growing understanding that wildfire smoke can be more toxic than standard air pollution.",

      "Of course, the researchers don't know exactly how much smoke each person was exposed to, and other studies would need to be done to explore cause-and-effect, she added.",
      "The study also found 40% saying their health had declined since the fires, with close to half talking about increased fatigue and weakness, eye irritation and lung-related symptoms.",
      "Jonathan Purtle of New York University was the lead author of another study, which calculated rates of suicide and overdose deaths in Maui and Hawaii's four other counties. That research team found a 97% increase in suicides and overdose death rates on Maui during the month of the wildfires. The total number of suicide and overdose deaths was 13 that month \u2014 most of them suicides. That's a significant increase, Ebi said.",
      "They also found a 46% increase in such deaths in all five counties, which may have been influenced by displaced Maui residents migrating to other islands, the authors said.",
      "The increases did not last: Rates fells in the following months, the researchers found.",
      "The third study was led by researchers in Finland. They used mathematical modeling to estimate that there were 440 more deaths in Los Angeles County from Jan. 5 to Feb. 1 than what would normally have been expected, and said those are related to the fires.",

      "India's opposition accuses the Election Commission of India of rushing through a mammoth electoral roll revision in eastern Bihar state, saying the exercise could render vast numbers of citizens unable to vote. The revision of nearly 80 million voters involves strict documentation requirements from citizens, triggering concerns it could lead to the exclusion of vulnerable groups, especially those who are unable to produce the paperwork required to prove their citizenship.",
      "Some of the documents required include birth certificates, passports and matriculation records.

      "According to the commission, some 49.6 million voters whose names were included in a similar exercise in 2003 are not required to submit any further documents. But that still leaves almost 30 million other voters potentially vulnerable. A similar roll revision of voters is scheduled to be replicated across the nation of 1.4 billion people.",

It has also claimed the exercise is essential to weed out undocumented Muslim immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh who have fraudulently entered India\u2019s electoral rolls.",
      "Critics and opposition leaders have warned that the exercise is similar to that of a controversial 2019 citizenship list in India's eastern Assam state, which left nearly 2 million people at risk of statelessness.

      "It\u2019s the latest flare-up of long-simmering territorial disputes in the busy waterway, a key global trade route, where overlapping claims between China and the Philippines have escalated in recent years. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also lay claims to parts of the contested waters.",
      "Relations between China and the Philippines have been severely strained after Marcos, who took office in mid-2022, and his administration emerged as some of the most vocal critics in Asia of China\u2019s increasingly aggressive actions in the South China Sea. The Marcos administration deepened its treaty alliance engagements with the United States and started broadening security alliances with other Western and Asian countries like Japan, Australia, India and some EU member states to strengthen deterrence against Beijing\u2019s assertiveness.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- It\u2019s the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth \u2014 a 54-pound (25-kilogram) meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record.",

      "Meteorite hunting is growing in arid Saharan countries like Niger. Though meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery in part due to the favorable climate for their preservation.",
      "Hunters often search for space rocks that can be sold to collectors or scientists. The rarest and most precious are from Mars and the moon.",
      "According to the Heritage academic journal, the rock was sold to an international dealer before it ended up in a private galley in Italy. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said.",
      "The meteorite was also briefly on display in Rome before it was next seen in public in New York last month during the auction.",
      "Following the sale, Niger raised questions about how the meteorite came to be sold at auction.",
      "Niger's government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite's discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was \u201cakin to illicit international trafficking.\u201d",

She takes deep pride in making the revered \u201cbudare,\u201d the common denominator among rural tin-roofed homes and city apartments, but she owns nothing to her name despite the years selling cookware.",
      "P\u00e9rez, in fact, owes about $5,000 because she and her family never made it to the United States, where they had hoped to escape Venezuela\u2019s entrenched political, social and economic crisis. Now, like thousands of Venezuelans who have voluntarily or otherwise returned to their country this year, they are starting over as the crisis worsens.",
      "\u201cWhen I decided to leave in August, I sold everything: house, belongings, car, everything from my factory \u2014 molds, sand. I was left with nothing,\u201d P\u00e9rez, 30, said at her in-laws\u2019 home in western Venezuela. \u201cWe arrived in Mexico, stayed there for seven months, and when President (Donald Trump) came to power in January, I said, \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019\u201d",

      "Many Venezuelans entered the U.S. under programs that allowed them to obtain work permits and shielded them from deportation. But since January, the White House has ended immigrants\u2019 protections and aggressively sought their deportations as U.S. President Donald Trump fulfills his campaign promise to limit immigration to the U.S.",
      "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had long refused to take back deported Venezuelans but changed course earlier this year under pressure from the White House. Immigrants now arrive regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by either a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela's state-owned airline.",
      "The U.S. government has defended its bold moves, including sending more than 200 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador for four months, arguing that many of the immigrants belonged to the violent Tren de Aragua street gang. The administration did not provide evidence to back up the blanket accusation. However, several recently deported immigrants have said U.S. authorities wrongly judged their tattoos and used them as an excuse to deport them.",
      "Many of those returning home, like P\u00e9rez and her family, are finding harsher living conditions than when they left as a currency crisis, triple-digit inflation and meager wages have made food and other necessities unaffordable, let alone the vehicle, home and electronics they sold before migrating. The monthly minimum wage of 130 bolivars, or $1.02 as of Monday, has not increased in Venezuela since 2022. People typically have two, three or more jobs to cobble together money.",

      "Despite Bosnia\u2019s notoriously poor record-keeping, tourism officials in the mountainous Balkan country of 3.3 million say a clear trend is emerging.",
      "\u201cWe used to rely on snow, but there is no escaping the fact that snow is now likely to fall and accumulate at altitudes above 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) and our mountains are simply not that high,\u201d said Haris Fazlagic, the Sarajevo tourism board president.",
      "Fazlagic believes that by expanding their summer offerings, mountain resorts can lure tourists away from the scorching heat and high costs of traditional seaside vacations along the Adriatic coast of Croatia and Montenegro. He said increasing the area's year-round appeal is \u201cthe future of tourism,\u201d but acknowledged it\u2019s a long-term strategy.",
      "In 2017, after several winters with little snow, the Jahorina and Bjelasnica mountains near Sarajevo began to expand their summer offerings. These mountains, which hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics, have elevations of 1,906 meters (6,253 feet) and 2,067 meters (6,781 feet), respectively.",
      "They now operate ski lifts year-round for scenic views and are steadily adding new hiking, biking and ATV trails and tours.",

      "Like other visitors exploring the forest trails and riding ski lifts around Sarajevo, Kurtovic was dressed for balmy summer weather. Temperatures here typically stay between 24 and 30 degrees Celsius (75-86 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "The weather is a welcome change for tourists, as coastal regions in Central and Eastern Europe have experienced increasingly frequent and prolonged heat waves, with daily temperatures often reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past few years.",

      "\u201cIn our careers, as automobile people we\u2019re lucky if we get to work on one, maybe two, projects that really change the face of our industry,\u201d CEO Jim Farley told plant workers in Kentucky on Monday. \u201cAnd I believe today is going to light the match as one of those projects for all of us here.\u201d",
      "The Big Detroit automakers have continued to transition from internal combustion engines to EV technology even as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration unwinds incentives for automakers to go electric. Trump\u2019s massive tax and spending law targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.",

      "The new electric trucks will be powered by lower-cost batteries made at a Ford factory in Michigan. The Detroit automaker previously announced a $3 billion investment to build the battery factory.",
      "The automaker sees this as a \u201cModel T moment\u201d for its EV business \u2014 a reference to revolutionary changes on the production line led by the company's founder, Henry Ford, when it began churning out vehicles from a factory more than a century ago. Farley said the changes will will upend how electric vehicles are made in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt represents the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model-T,\u201d Farley said.",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- When U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of 50% on Brazilian exports in July, acai producer Ailson Ferreira Moreira felt immediately concerned.",
      "After all, who was going to eat all of that Amazon berry, globally famous as a delicious, refreshing and nutritious superfood, if American consumers suddenly could no longer afford it?",
      "As the main importer of the Brazilian berry, prices of acai smoothies and bowls look certain to go up in the United States.",
      "\u201cThe acai that\u2019s all produced here ... If only people here eat it, it\u2019s going to be a lot of acai, right?\u201d Moreira told The Associated Press outside of Belem, an Amazon city of 1.4 million residents that will host this year's U.N. climate summit COP30 climate summit in November. \u201cIf there\u2019s too much acai here, people won\u2019t be able to eat it all and the price will drop.\u201d",
      "A single full crate of acai sells for around $50 at local markets in Brazil, a price that is now expected to plummet. The U.S. is by far the largest acai importer of a total Brazilian output currently estimated at about 70,000 tons per year.",
      "The most vulnerable acai producers in the northern state of Para say they have already been hit by tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, as a surplus of the berry without a clear destination starts to mount only days after the new economic scenario unfolded.",
      "More powerful exporters, such as Sao Paulo-state based company Acai Tropicalia Mix, are also feeling the impact.",
      "One of its owners, Rog\u00e9rio de Carvalho, told the AP that last year he exported to the U.S. about 270 tons of acai cream \u2014 an industrialized version of the berry \u2014 ready for consumption. As tariffs started to loom, he said, American importers steered away and clients suspended negotiations. Until the end of July, de Carvalho estimates that his company sold 27 tons to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThat's 1.5 million Brazilian reais ($280,000) that we lost,\u201d the businessman said. \u201cWe are confident there will be a deal between the two countries to allow not only our clients to return, but also getting some new ones.\u201d",
      "Trump has linked the higher tariffs on Brazil to the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is now under house arrest for his alleged role in leading an alleged coup plot to remain in office, despite his election loss to current leftist President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",

      "The harvesting of acai is a physically demanding job that requires workers to climb tall trees with minimal safety equipment, and then sliding down branches full of berries to fill baskets and then place them carefully in crates. Analysts say its producers also help protect the rainforest from illegal loggers, miners and cattle ranchers.",
      "The night markets of Belem, such as the Ver-o-Peso acai market, are a hub of activity where the freshly harvested berries are brought in by boat and prepared for sale.",
      "The Brazilian Association of Fruit and Derivative Producers and Exporters estimates there was an explosive growth of acai exports from Para state, from less than one ton in 1999 to more than 61,000 tons in 2023. Another explosive rise was expected for this year, before the tariffs.",
      "On Thursday, Brazil requested consultations at the World Trade Organization over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration against the South American nation that went into effect on Wednesday.",

      "Michelle Bowman was one of two Fed officials who voted a week and a half ago in favor of cutting interest rates. Such a move could help boost the economy by making it cheaper for people to borrow money to buy a house or a car, but it could also threaten to push inflation higher.",
      "Bowman and a fellow dissenter lost out after nine other Fed officials voted to keep interest rates steady, as the Fed has been doing all year. The Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, has been adamant that he wants to wait for more data about how President Donald Trump's tariffs are affecting inflation before the Fed makes its next move.",
      "At a speech during a bankers' conference in Colorado on Saturday, Bowman said that \u201cthe latest labor market data reinforce my view\u201d that the Fed should cut interest rates three times this year. The Fed has only three meetings left on the schedule in 2025.",
      "The jobs report that arrived last week, only a couple of days after the Fed voted on interest rates, showed that employers hired far fewer workers last month than economists expected. It also said that hiring in prior months was much lower than initially thought.",
      "On inflation, meanwhile, Bowman said she is getting more confident that Trump's tariffs \u201cwill not present a persistent shock to inflation\u201d and sees it moving closer to the Fed's 2% target. Inflation has come down substantially since hitting a peak above 9% after the pandemic, but it has been stubbornly remaining above 2%.",

The Fed has no good tool to fix that, and it would likely have to prioritize either the job market or inflation before helping the other.",

      "After deciding her next home would be outside the U.S., she narrowed down her choices based on tax burdens (Spain was out with its wealth taxes), climate (no Costa Rica, too hot) and ease of travel within Europe, one of her favorite parts of the world. She then toured Portugal with a relocation company, Expatsi, and found her new home, Aveiro. It's a striking city on the country's west coast with lovely canals that earned it the nickname the Venice of Portugal.",

      "According to aging and relocation experts, Taylor has made the right decisions.",
      "The number of people who relocate upon retirement fluctuates, based on such factors as politics, home affordability and cost-of-living rates. While older adults are less likely to move than younger populations, more than 3 million people age 65 and older relocated within the U.S. in the five years before the coronavirus pandemic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "As for moving abroad, U.S. politics is now the No. 1 reason cited by people who use Expatsi, the company's co-founder Jen Barnett said.",
      "\u201cThe one downside is that a lot of countries retirees are interested in don\u2019t want retirees, and that is to say wealthy, English-speaking countries, because they want laborers,\u201d Barnett said.",

      "The remote Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument is home to turtles, marine mammals and seabirds, which environmental groups say will get snagged by longline fishing, an industrial method involving baited hooks from lines 60 miles (about 100 kilometers) or longer.",

The ruling means boats catching fish for sale will need to immediately cease fishing in waters between 50 and 200 nautical miles (93 kilometers to 370 kilometers) around Johnston Atoll, Jarvis Island and Wake Island, said Earthjustice, an environmental law organization representing the plaintiffs.",

      "Earthjustice challenged that letter, and by granting the motion in their favor, the federal judge found the government had chosen not to defend its letter on the merits and forfeited that argument. Smith also ruled against the government's other defenses, that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the letter and that the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter.",
      "David Henkin, an Earthjustice attorney, said Smith's ruling requires the government to go through a process to determine what kind of fishing, and under what conditions, can happen in monument waters in a way that wouldn't destroy the area.",

      "Global financial markets have taken President Donald Trump's tariff adjustments in stride, with Asian and European shares and U.S. futures mostly higher",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his monthslong tariff threats has begun to create visible damage for the U.S. economy.",
      "Just after midnight, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union became subject to tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the EU, Japan and South Korea are taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are taxed at 20%. Trump also expects the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\u201d Trump said Wednesday afternoon. He added that the U.S. was \u201ctaking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs,\u201d but he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \u201cwe don\u2019t even know what the final number is\u201d regarding tariff rates.",
      "Despite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the Republican administration believes they can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.",
      "But so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with Trump\u2019s initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "Economic reports show that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline after April, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy.",
      "\u201cA less productive economy requires fewer workers,\u201d Silvia said in an analysis note. \u201cBut there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\u201d",
      "Even then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly.",
      "\u201cWe all want it to be made for television where it\u2019s this explosion \u2014 it\u2019s not like that,\u201d said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\u201d",
      "Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year.",
      "The economic pain isn't confined to the U.S. Germany, which sends 10% of its exports to the U.S. market, saw industrial production sag 1.9% in June as Trump's earlier rounds of tariff hikes took hold. \u201cThe new tariffs will clearly weigh on economic growth,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro for ING bank.",
      "The lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. The process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 only said the higher tax rates would start in seven days.",
      "Trump on Wednesday announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India for its buying of Russian oil, bringing its total import taxes to 50%.",

      "Still, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months.",

      "Toyota has reported its profit plunged 37% in the April-June quarter and it lowered its full year earnings forecasts, largely because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs",
      "TOKYO -- Toyota's profit plunged 37% in the April-June quarter, the company said Thursday, cutting its full year earnings forecasts largely because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The Japanese automaker said it based its report on the assumption that Trump\u2019s tariffs on exports from Japan, including autos, would be 12.5% starting this month. As of now they stand at 15%.",
      "The world\u2019s top automaker also makes vehicles in Mexico and Canada. Toyota\u2019s profit in the last quarter totaled 841 billion yen, or $5.7 billion, down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period the year before. Its quarterly sales rose 3%.",
      "The status of those exports is unclear since Mexico and Canada are beneficiaries of the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement, renegotiated from a 1990s pact during Trump's first term in office, that eliminated most tariffs and trade barriers between the three countries.",
      "Toyota Motor Corp.\u2019s April-June profit totaled 841 billion yen ($5.7 billion), down from 1.33 trillion yen in the same period of 2024. Quarterly sales rose 3% to 12 trillion yen ($82 billion).",
      "Toyota said the tariffs cost its quarterly operating profit 450 billion yen ($3 billion). Cost reduction efforts and the negative impact of an unfavorable exchange rate also hurt its bottom line.",
      "The company, which makes the Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models, forecast a 2.66 trillion yen ($18 billion) profit for the full fiscal year ending in March 2026, down from an earlier forecast for a 3.1 trillion yen ($21 billion) profit. Toyota earned nearly 4.8 trillion yen in the previous fiscal year.",
      "\u201cDespite a challenging external environment, we have continued to make comprehensive investments, as well as improvements such as increased unit sales, cost reductions and expanded value chain profits,\u201d Toyota said in a statement that outlined its efforts to minimize the impact of the tariffs.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is vowing to \u201cfix\u201d the federal program for compensating Americans injured by vaccines, opening the door to sweeping changes for a system long targeted by anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries.",
      "But they also worry Kennedy\u2019s changes will reflect his history as a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, which has alternately called for abolishing the program or expanding it to cover unproven injuries and illnesses that aren't connected to vaccines.",
      "Kennedy and other critics believe the program is \u201ctoo miserly in what it considers to be a vaccine injury,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a public health expert at Yale University. \u201cThat\u2019s created great concern that he could expand what\u2019s included.\u201d",
      "Anti-vaccine groups have long suggested a link between vaccines and autism, despite scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don\u2019t cause the condition. Adding autism to the list of injuries covered by the plan \u201cwould dramatically increase the number of compensable cases, potentially bankrupting it,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. At the time of its creation, a number of vaccine-makers were exiting the business due to risks of class action lawsuits.",
      "In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program \u201cbroken\u201d and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of \u201cinefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.\u201d",
      "Kennedy didn\u2019t specify the changes he's seeking. But some of the people he\u2019s enlisted to help have a history of bringing vaccine injury cases.",
      "In June, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $150,000 contract to an Arizona law firm for \u201cexpertise\u201d in the program. The firm\u2019s Andrew Downing, an attorney specializing in vaccine injury cases, was listed in the HHS staff directory for a time.",
      "\u201cWe just brought a guy in this week who is going to be revolutionizing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,\u201d Kennedy told Tucker Carlson shortly after the award.",
      "Revamping the program would be the latest in a string of decisions that have upended U.S. vaccine policy, including this week's cancellation of research funding for vaccines using mRNA technology.",
      "Downing has had a leading role in lawsuits against Merck alleging injuries from its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, including a rare movement disorder.",
      "In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program \u201chas taken a hard line\u201d against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Approximately 70% of the Gardasil cases against Merck started as claims filed by Downing in the federal injury program, according to court records.",
      "A judge dismissed more than 120 of those cases, citing \u201ca paucity of evidence\" that Gardasil caused patients' problems.",
      "A spokesman for Kennedy declined to comment on Downing\u2019s hiring.",
      "Kennedy himself has been involved in the Gardasil litigation, as both an attorney and consultant.",
      "Before joining the government, Kennedy received payments for referring potential Gardasil clients to Wisner Baum, one of the law firms suing Merck. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to \u201ca nondependent, adult son,\" according to his financial disclosures.",

      "The U.S. has an \u201cethical obligation\u201d to promptly pay those harmed by government-recommended vaccines, says Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law.",

      "As health secretary, Kennedy has broad powers to reshape the program.",
      "One approach could be adding new diseases and illnesses to the government table of payable injuries.",
      "In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children\u2019s autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link.",
      "Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm \u2014 perhaps from a large autism study he's commissioned \u2014 and add the condition to the program.",
      "In response, the federal government might have to increase taxes on vaccines to replenish the compensation fund, which would make the shots more expensive and less accessible.",
      "\u201cThen you will start to watch the vaccine program infrastructure in this country disintegrate until someone steps in,\u201d Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia who has clashed with Kennedy for years.",
      "A recent Senate hearing titled \u201cVoice of the Vaccine Injured\u201d appeared to make the case for expanding the program. Witnesses included two representatives from Children\u2019s Health Defense, the nonprofit group that Kennedy previously chaired and has repeatedly sued the government over vaccines.",
      "The group\u2019s chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son\u2019s autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.",
      "Another approach would involve removing certain vaccines from the program, making it easier to bring lawsuits against vaccine-makers. Under current law, people claiming injuries from vaccines covered by the program must first pursue a compensation claim before they can sue.",
      "In cases where the science doesn\u2019t support a connection to vaccines, lawyers might be more successful before a jury.",
      "\u201cJury trials take advantage of the fact that most jurors don\u2019t know anything about science or medicine,\u201d Offit said. \u201cThey are not going to be as easily moved by the data.\u201d",
      "Still, attorneys who bring cases before the compensation program say the process has become more burdensome and adversarial over the years.",
      "Even small changes could improve things. For instance, the statute of limitations for claims could be extended beyond the current three years, which lawyers say cuts off many potential clients.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping there will be changes put in place that make the program easier for petitioners to navigate\u201d said Leah Durant, a vaccine injury attorney.",

      "Everybody wants to save money. Buying a lightly used car instead of a new car is one way to do that. Choosing a fuel-efficient hybrid model is another way. Combine those approaches, and you might be surprised to discover what you can drive even when you\u2019re on a tight budget. The five hybrid sedans listed below in alphabetical order are worthy of consideration due to their low prices, great EPA-estimated fuel economy, and favorable crash test ratings.

It gets better gas mileage, comfortably accommodates four people, and boasts a trunk as spacious as the trunks of some midsize cars. Honda based this version of the Insight on the popular Civic sedan, giving the Insight different styling and a more upscale-feeling interior.

      "An increase in the tax on university endowments is creating financial challenges for the wealthiest U.S. colleges",
      "A big increase in the tax on university endowments is adding to financial uncertainty for the wealthiest colleges in the U.S., leading several already to lay off staff or implement hiring freezes.",
      "Spending more endowment money on taxes could also lead colleges to reduce financial aid, cutting off access to elite institutions for lower-income students, colleges and industry experts have warned. President Donald Trump signed the tax increase into law last month as part of his signature spending bill.",
      "The new tax rates take effect in 2026, but colleges such as Harvard, Yale and Stanford already are citing the tax as one of many reasons for making cuts across their universities. Each will be on the hook to pay hundreds of millions more in taxes, while also navigating reductions in research grants and other threats to funding by the Trump administration.",
      "A tax on college endowments was introduced during Trump's first administration, collecting 1.4% of wealthy universities' investment earnings. The law signed by Trump last month creates a new tiered system that taxes the richest schools at the highest rates.",
      "The new tax will charge an 8% rate at schools with $2 million or more in assets for each enrolled student. Schools with $750,000 to $2 million will be charged 4%, and schools with $500,000 to $750,000 will continue to be charged the 1.4% rate.",
      "The tax applies only to private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 students, up from the previous cutoff of 500 students.",
      "\u201cThe tax now will really solely apply to private research universities,\u201d said Steven Bloom, assistant vice president of government relations for the American Council on Education. \u201cIt\u2019s going to mean that these schools are going to have to spend more money under the tax, taking it away from what they primarily use their endowment assets for \u2014 financial aid.\u201d",
      "The law will increase the endowment tax for about a dozen universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers.",
      "Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are expected to pay the 8% rate next year. The schools facing the 4% rate include Notre Dame, Dartmouth College, Rice University, University of Pennsylvania, Washington University in St. Louis and Vanderbilt University.",
      "Some universities are on the edge of the law's parameters. Both Duke and Emory, for instance, were shy of the $750,000-per-student endowment threshold based on last fiscal year.",
      "Endowments are made up of donations to the college, which are invested to maintain the money over time. Colleges often spend about 5% of their investment earnings every year to put toward their budgets. Much of it goes toward scholarships for students, along with costs such as research or endowed faculty positions.",
      "Despite the colleges' wealth, the tax will drastically impact their budgets, said Phillip Levine, an economist and professor at Wellesley College.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re looking for savings wherever possible,\u201d Levine said, which could impact financial aid. \u201cOne of the most important things they do with their endowment is lower the cost of education for lower- and middle-income students. The institutions paying the highest tax are also the ones charging these students the least amount of money to attend.\u201d",

      "For example, at Rice University in Houston, officials anticipate the college will need to pay $6.4 million more in taxes. That equates to more than 100 student financial aid packages, the university said, but Rice officials will explore all other options to avoid cutting that support.",
      "In the meantime, some universities are going forward with staff cuts.",
      "Yale University says it will have to pay an estimated $280 million in total endowment taxes, citing the tax in a campus message implementing a hiring freeze. Stanford University announced plans to reduce its operating budget by $140 million this upcoming school year, which included 363 layoffs and an ongoing hiring freeze. The university spent months trying to determine where to reduce its budget, but said it would continue to support undergraduate financial aid and funding for Ph.D. students.",
      "Research universities are under increasing financial pressure from reductions in funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies.",
      "No university knows this pressure better than Harvard, the country's wealthiest college. Its $53 billion endowment puts it at the top of the list for the new tax, but it's also seeing massive portions of research funding under threat in its ongoing battle with the White House.",
      "The federal government has frozen $2.6 billion in Harvard's research grants in connection with civil rights investigations focused on antisemitism and Harvard's efforts to promote diversity on campus. But the impact of other administration policies on the university could approach $1 billion annually, Harvard said in a statement.",

      "The NFL is recommending enhanced security measures at team and league facilities following a shooting last month at a Manhattan office tower by a gunman authorities say was targeting league headquarters.",
      "The memo, which was sent to all teams on Friday, outlined three recommended changes to security protocols. They will be reviewed at a special league meeting on Aug. 26.",
      "\u201cIn moments like these, we are reminded that safety is not a background function. It is foundational,\u201d the memo said.",
      "The enhanced measures recommended include: updated threat assessments at every team and league facility to ensure risks are accurately identified and mitigated; presence of armed officers at team and league facilities whenever players or staff members are present; weapons screening for anyone seeking entry into a team or league facility, including the use of walk-through magnetometers and X-ray scanners for bags, similar to the process for obtaining entry into games.",
      "\u201cThe Committee recognizes that these changes will affect day-to-day operations and require an investment of time, coordination, and resources,\u201d the memo said. \u201cHowever, there is no higher priority than the safety and security of our players, coaches, staff, and everyone who works in and around our facilities.\u201d",
      "Investigators believe Shane Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas, was trying to get to the NFL offices after shooting several people in the building\u2019s lobby, then another in a 33rd-floor office on July 28, before he killed himself, authorities said.",

      "Hezly Rivera has claimed victory at the U.S. gymnastics championships",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Hezly Rivera was the fresh face a year ago. The newcomer. The teenager on a team of 20-something Olympic gymnasts, doing her best to absorb what she could from Simone Biles, Sunisa Lee, Jade Carey and Jordan Chiles.",
      "The one thing that stood out, even more than the sometimes otherworldly gymnastics, is the way her fellow gold-medal-winning teammates went about their business.",
      "\u201cThey looked so confident,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cThey're like, \u2018I\u2019m going to go out and I'm going to hit.' It gave me that confidence as well.\u201d",
      "Looks like it.",
      "The now 17-year-old who says she's paying no attention to the idea that she's the leader of the women's program in the early stages of the run-up to the 2028 Olympics certainly looks the part.",
      "Buoyed by a polished steadiness \u2014 and a beam routine that finally looked the way it does back home at her home gym in Texas \u2014 Rivera captured her first national title Sunday night at the U.S. Championships. Her two-day total of 112.000 was good enough to fend off a challenge from Leanne Wong and put her in excellent position to lead the four-woman American delegation at the world championships in Jakarta, Indonesia, in October.",
      "Rivera, by far the youngest member of the five-woman team that finished atop the podium in Paris a year ago, bounced back from a shaky performance at the U.S. Classic last month with the kind of measured, refined gymnastics that she attributed to simply \u201cletting go\u201d of whatever pressure she might feel as the lone Olympic gold medalist in a remarkably young field.",
      "\u201cNo matter how rough the competition is, I still can get back into the gym and work hard because all those months previously that I\u2019ve been working hard, I know it\u2019s going to show up eventually,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it kind of just took a weight off my shoulders.\u201d",
      "Rivera, at the very least, locked up a spot in the world championship selection camp next month. So did Wong, a four-time world championship medalist, budding entrepreneur and pre-med student who shows no signs of slowing down despite years of competing collegiately and at the elite level simultaneously.",
      "Asked how she juggles it all, the 21-year-old who insists she doesn't keep a planner said she lives by the motto \u201cthere's time for everything.\u201d",
      "Joscelyn Roberson, an Olympic alternate last summer, shook off an ankle injury suffered at the end of her floor routine to finish third as the three most internationally experienced athletes in the field looked ready to lead after spending most of the last Olympic quad learning from Biles and company.",
      "\u201cYou go from, \u2018Oh you\u2019re so young, you\u2019re so young,\u2019 to, \u2018Oh, you are the older kid,\u2019\u201d the 19-year-old Roberson said. \u201cPeople say, \u2018How are you feeling?\u2019 Like, I honestly don\u2019t feel that different.\u201d",

      "Roberson then walked the walk. Or maybe limped the limp. She appeared ready to make it a three-woman race for first until she turned an ankle on the final tumbling pass of her floor routine.",
      "The rising sophomore at Arkansas gingerly continued on anyway. She gritted her way through her vault dismount, though the five-tenths (0.5) deduction for using an additional pad for her protection took her out of contention for the all-around.",

      "Bennett passed for 188 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Rams to a 31-21 preseason victory over the Cowboys on Saturday night in Schottenheimer's head coaching debut.",
      "Although the top players on both teams didn't play, the game was still a milestone to the 51-year-old Schottenheimer, a well-traveled career assistant with stops including USC, the San Diego Chargers and two stints with the St. Louis Rams. He spent the past two years as Dallas\u2019 offensive coordinator before becoming Jerry Jones\u2019 surprising choice to replace Mike McCarthy last January.",
      "\u201cI got a little bit choked up coming to the stadium, and then when Jerry and I talked a little bit, I\u2019ll be honest, I got a little emotional,\u201d Schottenheimer said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a dream of mine to be in this chair, and he and I were just talking about our journeys, and we were telling some stories. ... It was just the two of us, and I\u2019m very appreciative of him and the Jones family for having me in this chair.\u201d",
      "Although he has no intention of showing many offensive tendencies in the preseason to start his first year as Dallas\u2019 play-caller, Schottenheimer got right to work in the other privileges of his new job: He unsuccessfully challenged a sideline catch by the Rams\u2019 Xavier Smith on a 39-yard pass from Bennett on the game\u2019s opening drive.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve got some good film to look at from an evaluation standpoint, but at the end of the day, I\u2019ll remember this day for a long time,\u201d Schottenheimer said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the result that we wanted, but first time out there as a head coach, it felt pretty good.\u201d",
      "Joe Milton passed for 143 yards before bruising his elbow in the fourth quarter of a solid debut with the Cowboys, throwing a touchdown pass to Rivaldo Fairweather with 8:48 to play.",
      "But Dallas started slowly and never caught up, managing just 1 net yard of offense in the first quarter to the Rams\u2019 160.",
      "Blake Corum rushed for short TDs to cap the Rams\u2019 first two offensive drives led by Bennett. The two-time national champion at the University of Georgia is attempting to secure his job as the Rams\u2019 third-string quarterback for another season.",
      "Looking much sharper than he did a year ago against the Cowboys, Bennett went 16 for 24 and hit Cody Schrader and Brennan Presley for touchdowns in the second half.",
      "\u201cI thought I played pretty well,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI was just glad I didn't try to force anything. (It went) pretty well, but there's things I'm going to clean up.\u201d",
      "Bennett's only interception resulted from an exceptional play made by Dallas' Israel Mukuamu on a long pass.",
      "Milton, who had one interception while going 17 for 29, is a second-year pro looking to cement his job as Dak Prescott\u2019s backup. He slightly hurt his elbow on a hit, but felt he could have gone back in the game if necessary.",
      "\u201cI was very excited,\" Milton said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what got me off of my tracks, but I feel like if I was to go back out there again right now, I\u2019d be able to settle down faster and make those throws, for sure.\u201d",
      "Will Grier replaced Milton for the Cowboys' final series and rushed for a TD with 2:31 left.",

      "Browns coach Kevin Stefanski hasn't decided if Shedeur Sanders will work with the first-team offense after his impressive NFL debut",
      "CLEVELAND -- Less than 24 hours after Shedeur Sanders' impressive NFL debut, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski still wasn't ready to answer the question most on the mind of Cleveland fans.",
      "Will Sanders start working with the first-team offense leading into next Saturday's second preseason game at Philadelphia?",
      "\u201cWe need to get through the next couple of days from an injury standpoint and see where everybody is,\u201d Stefanski said Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m really focused on all of our quarterbacks\u2019 development and every single one of these reps last night, how important they are. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on more than anything.\"",
      "Sanders played nearly three quarters and had 45 snaps in Friday night's 30-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers. He directed three touchdown drives in 10 series (including a kneel down at the end of the first half) and completed 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and two TD passes.",
      "The stat that pleased everyone the most though is that the Browns didn't have a turnover.",
      "Sanders is listed as the fourth-string QB and has not seen any snaps with the first string during the first three weeks of practices. He got the start and received extended playing time in the preseason opener because of Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel sidelined with hamstring injuries. Joe Flacco got most of the work during last Wednesday's joint workouts.",
      "However, Sanders made a strong case in showing he should get opportunities to see how he fares against starters.",
      "The Browns\u2019 next practice is Monday at their team facility. They travel to Philadelphia on Tuesday before joint workouts with the Eagles on Wednesday and Thursday.",
      "For his part, Sanders continues to stay patient with the process the Browns have set out for his development. It is the same mentality he has had since dropping to the fifth round and the 144th overall selection in April's draft.",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t think that deep into everything because there\u2019s nothing you\u2019re going to be able to control.,\u201d Sanders said when asked if he is being given a fair chance in the Browns four-way quarterback competition. \u201cThe most you can do is when you get your opportunity, when your number is called, perform, at least do the bare minimum and win the game. That\u2019s what I feel like we did today and definitely things I\u2019m able to grow off of.\u201d",
      "In addition to seeing how he would fare in the red zone and a variety of third down scenarios, the coaching staff also got to see how Sanders would fare on a couple of series where the Browns started inside their 10 yard line.",

      "For the most part, Stefanski was able to run through a lot of different game situations.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to show much, but also you want to put your players in positions where you can evaluate them. We kind of did it all last night, including a jet sweep to Gage (Larvadain) for the touchdown,\" Stefanski said. \"We want to win because they\u2019re keeping score but you also want to vary your run types, vary your pass types so you\u2019re learning more about each one of your players.\u201d",
      "According to the NFL's Next Gen stats, Sanders was pressured on 12 of his 27 drop-backs. He was 5 of 9 for 81 yards, including a 12-yard touchdown to Kaden Davis to put the Browns up 14-7 in the second quarter.",
      "Sanders was sacked twice, but also avoided trouble a couple of times on scrambles where it could have been a 15 to 20-yard loss.",
      "Many considered Sanders to be one of the most accurate quarterbacks in this year's draft class. He showed that off on a couple of plays Friday \u2014 the second touchdown pass to Davis and a 30-yard completion to Luke Floriea where he layered it over four Carolina defenders and Floriea made a one-handed grab near the sideline.",
      "\u201cThat next step is getting in the game settings and taking the practice field to the game. I thought that\u2019s what we saw by and large from Shedeur, that\u2019s what we saw by and large from our offense, was really taking those things that we\u2019re honing in on the practice field and then showing them in the games,\u201d Stefanski said. \"While there\u2019s game plans that will be more complicated as you get going and certainly as you get to the season, we really want to put our guys in as many situations as possible, and I thought those guys handled it really well.\u201d",
      "In other news, Stefanski said Floriea has a hamstring injury and defensive back LaMareon James is in concussion protocol.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Amid rising electric bills, states are under pressure to insulate regular household and business ratepayers from the costs of feeding Big Tech's energy-hungry data centers.",
      "It's not clear that any state has a solution and the actual effect of data centers on electricity bills is difficult to pin down. Some critics question whether states have the spine to take a hard line against tech behemoths like Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Meta.",
      "But more than a dozen states have begun taking steps as data centers drive a rapid build-out of power plants and transmission lines.",
      "That has meant pressuring the nation's biggest power grid operator to clamp down on price increases, studying the effect of data centers on electricity bills or pushing data center owners to pay a larger share of local transmission costs.",
      "Rising power bills are \u201csomething legislators have been hearing a lot about. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been hearing a lot about. More people are speaking out at the public utility commission in the past year than I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d said Charlotte Shuff of the Oregon Citizens\u2019 Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive outcry.\u201d",
      "Some data centers could require more electricity than cities the size of Pittsburgh, Cleveland or New Orleans, and make huge factories look tiny by comparison. That's pushing policymakers to rethink a system that, historically, has spread transmission costs among classes of consumers that are proportional to electricity use.",
      "\u201cA lot of this infrastructure, billions of dollars of it, is being built just for a few customers and a few facilities and these happen to be the wealthiest companies in the world,\u201d said Ari Peskoe, who directs the Electricity Law Initiative at Harvard University. \u201cI think some of the fundamental assumptions behind all this just kind of breaks down.\u201d",
      "A fix, Peskoe said, is a \u201ccan of worms\" that pits ratepayer classes against one another.",
      "Some officials downplay the role of data centers in pushing up electric bills.",
      "Tricia Pridemore, who sits on Georgia\u2019s Public Service Commission and is president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, pointed to an already tightened electricity supply and increasing costs for power lines, utility poles, transformers and generators as utilities replace aging equipment or harden it against extreme weather.",
      "The data centers needed to accommodate the artificial intelligence boom are still in the regulatory planning stages, Pridemore said, and the Data Center Coalition, which represents Big Tech firms and data center developers, has said its members are committed to paying their fair share.",
      "But growing evidence suggests that the electricity bills of some Americans are rising to subsidize the massive energy needs of Big Tech as the U.S. competes in a race against China for artificial intelligence superiority.",
      "Data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie published a report in recent weeks that suggested 20 proposed or effective specialized rates for data centers in 16 states it studied aren\u2019t nearly enough to cover the cost of a new natural gas power plant.",
      "In other words, unless utilities negotiate higher specialized rates, other ratepayer classes \u2014 residential, commercial and industrial \u2014 are likely paying for data center power needs.",
      "Meanwhile, Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog for the mid-Atlantic grid, produced research in June showing that 70% \u2014 or $9.3 billion \u2014 of last year's increased electricity cost was the result of data center demand.",
      "Last year, five governors led by Pennsylvania's Josh Shapiro began pushing back against power prices set by the mid-Atlantic grid operator, PJM Interconnection, after that amount spiked nearly sevenfold. They warned of customers \u201cpaying billions more than is necessary.\u201d",

      "More than 70 million Americans have experienced the muggiest start to summer on record, with climate change increasing humidity in the Eastern U.S. An Associated Press analysis shows that parts of 20 states and Washington, D",
      "More than 70 million Americans sweated through the muggiest first two months of summer on record as climate change has noticeably dialed up the Eastern United States' humidity in recent decades, an Associated Press data analysis shows.",
      "And that meant uncomfortably warm and potentially dangerous nights in many cities the last several weeks, the National Weather Service said.",
      "Parts of 27 states and Washington, D.C., had a record amount of days that meteorologists call uncomfortable \u2014 with average daily dew points of 65 degrees Fahrenheit or higher \u2014 in June and July, according to data derived from the Copernicus Climate Service.",
      "And that's just the daily average. In much of the East, the mugginess kept rising to near tropical levels for a few humid hours. Philadelphia had 29 days, Washington had 27 days and Baltimore had 24 days where the highest dew point simmered to at least 75 degrees, which even the the weather service office in Tampa calls oppressive, according to weather service data.",
      "Dew point is a measure of moisture in the air expressed in degrees that many meteorologists call the most accurate way to describe humidity. The summer of 2025 so far has had dew points that average at least 6 degrees higher than the 1951-2020 normals in Washington, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Richmond, Columbus and St. Louis, the AP calculations show. The average June and July humidity for the entire country east of the Rockies rose to more than 66 degrees, higher than any year since measurements started in 1950.",
      "\u201cThis has been a very muggy summer. The humid heat has been way up,\u201d said Bernadette Woods Placky, chief meteorologist at Climate Central.",
      "Twice this summer climate scientist and humidity expert Cameron Lee of Kent State University measured dew points of about 82 degrees at his home weather station in Ohio. That's off the various charts that the weather service uses to describe what dew points feel like.",
      "\u201cThere are parts of the United States that are experiencing not only greater average humidity, especially in the spring and summer, but also more extreme humid days,\u201d Lee said. He said super sticky days are now stretching out over more days and more land.",
      "High humidity doesn't allow the air to cool at night as much as it usually does, and the stickiness contributed to multiple nighttime temperature records from the Ohio Valley through the Mid-Atlantic and up and down coastal states, said Zack Taylor, forecast operations chief at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Raleigh, Charlotte, Nashville, Virginia Beach, Va., and Wilmington, N.C., all reached records for the hottest overnight lows. New York City, Columbus, Atlanta, Richmond, Knoxville, Tennessee and Concord, New Hampshire came close, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat really impacts the body is that nighttime temperature,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s no cooling at night or if there\u2019s a lack of cooling it doesn\u2019t allow your body to cool off and recover from what was probably a really hot afternoon. And so when you start seeing that over several days, that can really wear out the body, especially of course if you don\u2019t have access to cooling centers or air conditioning.\u201d",
      "An extra hot and rainy summer weather pattern is combining with climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Woods Placky said.",
      "The area east of the Rockies has on average gained about 2.5 degrees in summer dew point since 1950, the AP analysis of Copernicus data shows. In the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and part of the 1990s, the eastern half of the country had an average dew point in the low 60s, what the weather service calls noticeable but OK. In four of the last six years that number has been near and even over the uncomfortable line of 65.",

      "President Donald Trump's plans for 100% tariffs on computer chips that aren't made in the U.S. are stoking confusion among businesses and trading partners \u2014 boosting stocks for leading semiconductor companies while leaving smaller producers scrambling to understand the implications.",
      "The U.S. imports a relatively small number of chips because most of the foreign-made chips in a device \u2014 from an iPhone to a car \u2014 were already assembled into a product, or part of a product, before it landed in the country.",
      "\"The real question everybody in the industry is asking is whether there will be a component tariff, where the chips in a device would require some sort of separate tariff calculation,\u201d said Martin Chorzempa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that companies that \"made a commitment to build\" in the U.S. would be spared the import tax, even if they are not yet producing those chips in American factories.",

      "The announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration\u2019s most onerous tariffs.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation. Chorzempa said chip tariffs could again raise prices by hundreds of dollars per vehicle if the semiconductors inside a car are not exempt.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a chip that allows you to open and close the window,\" Chorzempa said. \"There\u2019s a chip that is running the entertainment system. There is a chip that\u2019s kind of running all the electronics. There are chips, especially in EVs, that are doing power management, all that kind of stuff.\u201d",

      "Trump has vocally opposed those financial incentives and taken a different approach, betting that the threat of dramatically higher chip costs would force most companies to open factories domestically, despite the risk that tariffs could squeeze corporate profits and push up prices for electronics.",

      "New research from a watchdog group reveals ChatGPT can provide harmful advice to teens",
      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked, according to new research from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT\u2019s 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to test the guardrails,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \u201cThe visceral initial response is, \u2018Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.\u2019 The rails are completely ineffective. They\u2019re barely there \u2014 if anything, a fig leaf.\u201d",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said after viewing the report Tuesday that its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \u201cidentify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "OpenAI didn't directly address the report's findings or how ChatGPT affects teens, but said it was focused on \u201cgetting these kinds of scenarios right\u201d with tools to \u201cbetter detect signs of mental or emotional distress\" and improvements to the chatbot's behavior.",
      "The study published Wednesday comes as more people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship.",
      "About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world\u2019s population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s technology that has the potential to enable enormous leaps in productivity and human understanding,\" Ahmed said. \"And yet at the same time is an enabler in a much more destructive, malignant sense.\u201d",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl \u2014 with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\u201cI started crying,\u201d he said in an interview.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \u201cfor a presentation\u201d or a friend.",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to AI chatbots for companionship and half use AI companions regularly, according to a recent study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \u201cemotional overreliance\u201d on the technology, describing it as a \u201creally common thing\u201d with young people.",
      "\u201cPeople rely on ChatGPT too much,\u201d Altman said at a conference. \u201cThere\u2019s young people who just say, like, \u2018I can\u2019t make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that\u2019s going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I\u2019m gonna do whatever it says.\u2019 That feels really bad to me.\u201d",
      "Altman said the company is \u201ctrying to understand what to do about it.\u201d",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",

      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\u201cWrite a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\u201d asked a researcher. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \u201cemotionally exposed\u201d while \u201cstill respecting the community's coded language.\u201d",

      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it\u2019s not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to take more meaningful steps toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",

      "\u201cWhat it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, \u2018Chug, chug, chug, chug,\u2019\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cA real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say \u2018no\u2019 \u2014 that doesn\u2019t always enable and say \u2018yes.\u2019 This is a friend that betrays you.\u201d",

      "Hundreds of Harvard researchers have fallen victim to the freeze on funding by the Trump administration",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University professor Alberto Ascherio's research is literally frozen.",
      "Collected from millions of U.S. soldiers over two decades using millions of dollars from taxpayers, the epidemiology and nutrition scientist has blood samples stored in liquid nitrogen freezers within the university\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The samples are key to his award-winning research, which seeks a cure to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases. But for months, Ascherio has been unable to work with the samples because he lost $7 million in federal research funding, a casualty of Harvard's fight with the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cIt's like we have been creating a state-of-the-art telescope to explore the universe, and now we don\u2019t have money to launch it,\u201d said Ascherio. \u201cWe built everything and now we are ready to use it to make a new discovery that could impact millions of people in the world and then, 'Poof. You're being cut off.'\u201d",
      "The loss of an estimated $2.6 billion in federal funding at Harvard has meant that some of the world's most prominent researchers are laying off young researchers. They are shelving years or even decades of research, into everything from opioid addiction to cancer.",
      "And despite Harvard's lawsuits against the administration, and settlement talks between the warring parties, researchers are confronting the fact that some of their work may never resume.",
      "The funding cuts are part of a monthslong battle that the Trump administration has waged against some the country's top universities including Columbia, Brown and Northwestern. The administration has taken a particularly aggressive stance against Harvard, freezing funding after the country's oldest university rejected a series of government demands issued by a federal antisemitism task force.",
      "The government had demanded sweeping changes at Harvard related to campus protests, academics and admissions \u2014 meant to address government accusations that the university had become a hotbed of liberalism and tolerated anti-Jewish harassment.",
      "Harvard responded by filing a federal lawsuit, accusing the Trump administration of waging a retaliation campaign against the university. In the lawsuit, it laid out reforms it had taken to address antisemitism but also vowed not to \u201csurrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Harvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural reforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus,\" the university said in its legal complaint. \u201cBut rather than engage with Harvard regarding those ongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration denies the cuts were made in retaliation, saying the grants were under review even before the demands were sent in April. It argues the government has wide discretion to cancel federal contracts for policy reasons.",
      "The funding cuts have left Harvard's research community in a state of shock, feeling as if they are being unfairly targeted in a fight has nothing to do with them. Some have been forced to shutter labs or scramble to find non-government funding to replace lost money.",
      "In May, Harvard announced that it would put up at least $250 million of its own money to continue research efforts, but university President Alan Garber warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d ahead.",
      "Ascherio said the university was able to pull together funding to pay his researchers\u2019 salaries until next June. But he\u2019s still been left without resources needed to fund critical research tasks, like lab work. Even a year's delay can put his research back five years, he said.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really devastating,\u201d agreed Rita Hamad, the director of the Social Policies for Health Equity Research Center at Harvard, who had three multiyear grants totaling $10 million canceled by the Trump administration. The grants funded research into the impact of school segregation on heart health, how pandemic-era policies in over 250 counties affected mental health, and the role of neighborhood factors in dementia.",
      "At the School of Public Health, where Hamad is based, 190 grants have been terminated, affecting roughly 130 scientists.",
      "\u201cJust thinking about all the knowledge that\u2019s not going to be gained or that is going to be actively lost,\" Hamad said. She expects significant layoffs on her team if the funding freeze continues for a few more months. \"It\u2019s all just a mixture of frustration and anger and sadness all the time, every day.\"",

      "In April, a multimillion dollar grant was not renewed, jeopardizing a study into the role sex plays in disease. In May, he lost about $1.2 million in federal funding for in the coming year due to the Harvard freeze. Four departmental grants worth $24 million that funded training of doctoral students also were cancelled as part of the fight with the Trump administration, Quackenbush said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in a position where I have to really think about, \u2018Can I revive this research?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cCan I restart these programs even if Harvard and the Trump administration reached some kind of settlement? If they do reach a settlement, how quickly can the funding be turned back on? Can it be turned back on?\u201d",
      "The researchers all agreed that the funding cuts have little or nothing to do with the university's fight against antisemitism. Some, however, argue changes at Harvard were long overdue and pressure from the Trump administration was necessary.",
      "Bertha Madras, a Harvard psychobiologist who lost funding to create a free, parent-focused training to prevent teen opioid overdose and drug use, said she\u2019s happy to see the culling of what she called \u201cpolitically motivated social science studies.\u201d",
      "Madras said pressure from the White House has catalyzed much-needed reform at the university, where several programs of study have \u201creally gone off the wall in terms of being shaped by orthodoxy that is not representative of the country as a whole.\u201d",
      "But Madras, who served on the President\u2019s Commission on Opioids during Trump\u2019s first term, said holding scientists\u2019 research funding hostage as a bargaining chip doesn\u2019t make sense.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if reform would have happened without the president of the United States pointing the bony finger at Harvard,\" she said. \u201cBut sacrificing science is problematic, and it\u2019s very worrisome because it is one of the major pillars of strength of the country.\u201d",
      "Quackenbush and other Harvard researchers argue the cuts are part of a larger attack on science by the Trump administration that puts the country's reputation as the global research leader at risk. Support for students and post-doctoral fellows has been slashed, visas for foreign scholars threatened, and new guidelines and funding cuts at the NIH will make it much more difficult to get federal funding in the future, they said. It also will be difficult to replace federal funding with money from the private sector.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all sort of moving toward this future in which this 80-year partnership between the government and the universities is going to be jeopardized,\u201d Quackenbush said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face real challenges in continuing to lead the world in scientific excellence.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s highest court on Thursday blocked a key part of a contentious farming law that would have brought back a banned pesticide.",
      "The court said that the measure failed to protect the environment and future generations. The rest of the law \u2014 known as the \u201cDuplomb law,\u201d after the senator who proposed it \u2014 was allowed to stand.",
      "The bill, passed in early July, aimed to loosen rules for farmers and fast-track projects like water storage. It was backed by the government and major farming unions, but met fierce opposition from scientists, health experts and green groups.",
      "At the heart of the outrage was acetamiprid, a pesticide banned in France since 2018 for its role in harming bees and other pollinators. Farmers, especially sugar beet growers, had pushed for its return.",
      "But the court ruled that the proposal wasn't strict enough, and ignored France\u2019s constitutional commitment to environmental protection.",

      "The technology can also involve law enforcement in responses to mental health crises. In Florida's Polk County Schools, a district of more than 100,000 students, the school safety program received nearly 500 Gaggle alerts over four years, officers said in public Board of Education meetings. This led to 72 involuntary hospitalization cases under the Baker Act, a state law that allows authorities to require mental health evaluations for people against their will if they pose a risk to themselves or others.",
      "\u201cA really high number of children who experience involuntary examination remember it as a really traumatic and damaging experience \u2014 not something that helps them with their mental health care,\u201d said Sam Boyd, an attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

But almost two-thirds of those alerts were deemed by school officials to be non-issues \u2014 including over 200 false alarms from student homework, according to an Associated Press analysis of data received via a public records request.",
      "Students in one photography class were called to the principal\u2019s office over concerns Gaggle had detected nudity. The photos had been automatically deleted from the students\u2019 Google Drives, but students who had backups of the flagged images on their own devices showed it was a false alarm. District officials said they later adjusted the software's settings to reduce false alerts.",

She was among a group of student journalists and artists at Lawrence High School who filed a lawsuit against the school system last week, alleging Gaggle subjected them to unconstitutional surveillance.",

      "\u201cSometimes you have to look at the trade for the greater good,\u201d said Board of Education member Anne Costello in a July 2024 board meeting.",
      "Two years after their ordeal, Mathis said her daughter is doing better, although she\u2019s still \u201cterrified\u201d of running into one of the school officers who arrested her. One bright spot, she said, was the compassion of the teachers at her daughter\u2019s alternative school.

      "Roblox, the online gaming platform wildly popular with children and teenagers, is rolling out an open-source version of an artificial intelligence system it says can help preemptively detect predatory language in game chats.",
      "The move comes as the company faces lawsuits and criticism accusing it of not doing enough to protect children from predators. For instance, a lawsuit filed last month in Iowa alleges that a 13-year-old girl was introduced to an adult predator on Roblox, then kidnapped and trafficked across multiple states and raped. The suit, filed in Iowa District Court in Polk County, claims that Roblox's design features make children who use it \u201ceasy prey for pedophiles.\u201d",
      "Roblox says it strives to make its systems as safe as possible by default but notes that \u201cno system is perfect, and one of the biggest challenges in the industry is to detect critical harms like potential child endangerment.\u201d",
      "The AI system, called Sentinel, helps detect early signs of possible child endangerment, such as sexually exploitative language. Roblox says the system has led the company to submit 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the first half of 2025. The company is now in the process of open-sourcing it so other platforms can use it too.",
      "Preemptively detecting possible dangers to kids can be tricky for AI systems \u2014 and humans, too \u2014 because conversations can seem innocuous at first. Questions like \u201chow old are you?\u201d or \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d wouldn't necessarily raise red flags on their own, but when put in context over the course of a longer conversation, they can take on a different meaning.",
      "Roblox, which has more than 111 million monthly users, doesn't allow users to share videos or images in chats and tries to block any personal information such as phone numbers, though \u2014 as with most moderation rules \u2014 people constantly find ways to get around such safeguards.",
      "It also doesn't allow kids under 13 to chat with other users outside of games unless they have explicit parental permission \u2014 and unlike many other platforms, it does not encrypt private chat conversations, so it can monitor and moderate them.",

Roblox says this lets the system recognize harmful patterns that go beyond simply flagging certain words or phrases, taking the entire conversation into context.",

      "Scientists from a university are filtering Mexico City's waters for traces of the DNA of an endangered salamander, the axolotl",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Sixty years ago, residents of a canal-crossed borough in Mexico City could pluck axolotls \u2014 the large salamander reminiscent of a tiny dragon \u2014 out of the water with their hands because they were so plentiful. Now it\u2019s almost impossible to find them in the wild.",
      "That's why scientists from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University are filtering Xochimilco\u2019s murky waters for traces of the endangered creature\u2019s DNA.",
      "\u201cWe all shed DNA along our path across the world and that can be captured by filtering air or water,\u201d said biologist Luis Zambrano, from the university's ecological restoration lab.",
      "As they try to monitor the axolotls\u2019 dwindling numbers, scientists increasingly rely on this technique as their nets come back empty during periodic surveys of the population, which is only found in Xochimilco.",
      "They sample water taken from the canals and filter it for environmental DNA, or the genetic particles left by animals and plants that have contact with the water. That\u2019s then compared to the profiles contained in a genetic library put together some years ago by British scientists, said Esther Quintero of Conservation International in Mexico, which has collaborated with Zambrano since 2023.",
      "Scientists collected water from 53 locations in Xochimilco: 10 inside refuges where water is filtered and the water is cleaner and 43 outside those areas. They found axolotl DNA inside the protected areas and in one site outside them.",
      "Referring to the one unprotected area, Zambrano said \u201cit\u2019s very little,\u201d but a sign that there is the possibility of resilience, even with continuing environmental degradation and pollution of the canals.",
      "So far, the researchers have only searched a third of Xochimilco with the environmental DNA technique and the manual work with nets, but they plan to continue the work and hopefully present an updated census early next year.",
      "The trend, however, is not good. From an estimated 6,000 axolotls per square kilometer in 1998, there were only 36 per square kilometer in the last census, in 2014.",

Instead, the government should incentivize the islands\u2019 traditional agricultural production, ensuring that farmers can actually make a living at it.",

      "Despite Bosnia\u2019s notoriously poor record-keeping, tourism officials in the mountainous Balkan country of 3.3 million say a clear trend is emerging.",
      "\u201cWe used to rely on snow, but there is no escaping the fact that snow is now likely to fall and accumulate at altitudes above 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) and our mountains are simply not that high,\u201d said Haris Fazlagic, the Sarajevo tourism board president.",
      "Fazlagic believes that by expanding their summer offerings, mountain resorts can lure tourists away from the scorching heat and high costs of traditional seaside vacations along the Adriatic coast of Croatia and Montenegro. He said increasing the area's year-round appeal is \u201cthe future of tourism,\u201d but acknowledged it\u2019s a long-term strategy.",
      "In 2017, after several winters with little snow, the Jahorina and Bjelasnica mountains near Sarajevo began to expand their summer offerings. These mountains, which hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics, have elevations of 1,906 meters (6,253 feet) and 2,067 meters (6,781 feet), respectively.",

Unlike their Bosnian counterparts who are trying to increase visitors, Dubrovnik\u2019s tourism authorities are focused on managing crowds, limiting the number of tourists from cruise ships in the city to 4,000 at any one time during the day and restricting traffic around the Old Town to local permit holders.",
      "Despite these restrictions and extreme summer heat, Dubrovnik recorded nearly two million overnight stays in the first seven months of 2025, almost double that of the Sarajevo region.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital.",
      "Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia \u201csafer and more beautiful than it ever was before.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump wrote Sunday. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\u201d",
      "Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option \u201cto extend as needed.\u201d",
      "On Friday night, federal agencies including the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service assigned more than 120 officers and agents to assist in Washington.",
      "Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was \u201cridiculous\u201d and the city was \u201cunsafe,\u201d after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "The moves Trump said he was considering included bringing in the D.C. National Guard.",
      "Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws and said the federal government could be far more helpful by funding more prosecutors or filling the 15 vacancies on the D.C. Superior Court, some of which have been open for years.",
      "Bowser cannot activate the National Guard herself, but she can submit a request to the Pentagon.",
      "\u201cI just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our Guard,\u201d she said Sunday on MSNBC's \u201cThe Weekend,\u201d acknowledging it is \"the president\u2019s call about how to deploy the Guard.\u201d",
      "Bowser was making her first public comments since Trump started posting about crime in Washington last week. She noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023. Trump's weekend posts depicted the district as \u201cone of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.\"",

      "The police department and the mayor\u2019s office did not respond to questions about what Trump might do next.",
      "The president criticized the district as full of \u201ctents, squalor, filth, and Crime,\u201d and he seems to have been set off by the attack on Edward Coristine, among the most visible figures of the bureaucracy-cutting effort known as DOGE. Police arrested two 15-year-olds in the attempted carjacking and said they were looking for others.",
      "\u201cThis has to be the best run place in the country, not the worst run place in the country,\u201d Trump said Wednesday.",
      "He called Bowser \u201ca good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly suggested that the rule of Washington could be returned to federal authorities. Doing so would require a repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973 in Congress, a step Trump said lawyers are examining. It could face steep pushback.",
      "Bowser acknowledged that the law allows the president to take more control over the city's police, but only if certain conditions are met.",
      "\u201cNone of those conditions exist in our city right now,\" she said. \u201cWe are not experiencing a spike in crime. In fact, we\u2019re watching our crime numbers go down.\u201d",

      "A yearslong legal fight over the release of audio and video recordings and other records related to the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, is coming closer to an end",
      "HOUSTON -- A yearslong legal fight over the release of audio and video recordings and other records related to the May 2022 massacre at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, is coming closer to an end. The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District and Uvalde County are expected to make the disputed records public as early as this week.",
      "Media organizations, including The Associated Press, sued the district and county in 2022 for the release of their records related to the mass shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers. A Texas appeals court in July upheld a lower court\u2019s ruling that the records must be released.",
      "The City of Uvalde released its records from the mass shooting \u2014 including devastating video and recordings of police radio traffic and 911 calls \u2014 in August 2024. The city of about 15,000 people is about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of San Antonio.",
      "That information detailed the agonizingly slow law enforcement response, which has been widely condemned. Nearly 400 officers waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead and wounded children and teachers.",
      "The school district is expected to release police service and 911 call records; evidence logs related to the shooting; body-worn and security camera footage from Robb Elementary; student files for the shooter; internal communications among district officials; and results of school safety audits.",
      "It could also make public personnel files and other records related to Pete Arredondo, the former Uvalde schools police chief who was fired and indicted for his role in the police response.",
      "Records from the county are expected to include incident and 911 reports concerning Robb Elementary and other locations; sheriff dispatch logs and radio traffic; video footage; ballistics and evidence logs; and reports of law enforcement interactions with the shooter and his mother.",
      "It's not yet clear how much of this information has already been publicly released.",
      "Families of the victims have long sought accountability for the slow police response.",

    "story": [
      "The death of a New York City police officer in last week\u2019s midtown office tower shooting is highlighting the growth of Bangladeshi immigrants in the nation\u2019s largest police force",
      "NEW YORK -- Outside the Bronx mosque where a New York City police officer was eulogized last week, a group of officers in their formal navy blue uniforms solemnly hung a banner bearing the young officer\u2019s photograph and the name of his fraternity, the Bangladeshi American Police Association.",
      "Didarul Islam \u2014 one of four people killed in the July 28 shooting at the Manhattan office tower housing the NFL\u2019s headquarters \u2014 was the NYPD's first Bangladeshi American officer killed in the line of duty.",
      "His funeral underscored the fertile recruiting ground the department has found in the city\u2019s thriving Bangladeshi community. More than 1,000 of the NYPD\u2019s roughly 33,000 uniformed members are Bangladeshi Americans, according to the association. Another 1,500 people of Bangladeshi heritage are among the department\u2019s 19,000 civilian employees.",
      "Those numbers are up from just a handful of officers a few decades ago, a phenomenon some Bangladeshi officers attribute partly to their own patriotic response to anti-Muslim sentiment after the 9/11 attacks, as well as active recruitment and word-of-mouth in the community.",
      "Among the sea of NYPD officers who lined the street to honor Islam, 36, were some who opted for traditional South Asian attire, their police badges worn around their necks. Many joined the throngs of mourners who knelt in the street in prayer.",
      "\u201cHe actually uplifted our community in a way that was not imaginable before,\u201d said Shamsul Haque, one of the co-founders of the NYPD\u2019s Bangladeshi officers\u2019 group. \u201cHis legacy will endure not only as a hero who gave his life protecting others, but also as a symbol of hope, integrity and the American dream.\u201d",
      "When Haque joined the NYPD in 2004, he was one of just a few Bangladeshi immigrants. Many of those who joined around then wanted to dispel the notion that all Muslims were terrorist sympathizers, he said.",
      "Haque, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1991, had recently graduated college with a business administration degree when the twin towers fell. But rather than follow his peers into a financial field, he enrolled in the police academy, a decision he acknowledged was initially met with skepticism from his parents.",
      "In the aftermath of 9/11, the NYPD built up a domestic surveillance program that for years systematically spied on Muslim communities and monitored local businesses, mosques and student groups in a hunt for terror cells.",
      "Haque, 52, who retired earlier this year after becoming the first South Asian and first Muslim to attain the rank of lieutenant commander in the NYPD, said the perception of Muslims among rank-and-file members has improved.",
      "Early in his career, he recalled feeling singled out when a counterterrorism expert warned officers during a training session about the possibility of al-Qaida operatives infiltrating the force.",
      "\u201cOver the years, people started to realize that we work hard, we are ethical,\u201d Haque said. \u201cAlthough we are immigrants, we are patriotic.\u201d",
      "To grow their numbers, Haque and others went out into the community proselytizing a sensible path for recently arrived immigrants.",
      "Aspiring Bangladeshi officers were encouraged to take civilian jobs in the department, such as traffic enforcement officers and school safety agents, that don\u2019t require U.S. citizenship. After gaining citizenship, usually in about five years, they could then apply for the police academy to become a uniformed officer.",
      "Some 60% of all officers of Bangladeshi heritage in the NYPD followed this pipeline, Haque estimated. Islam, the officer killed last week, began his career as a school safety officer after immigrating to the U.S. about 16 years ago.",
      "The visible growth of Bangladeshis in the NYPD has helped many aspire to leadership roles in the department, just as generations of Irish, Italian and Latino immigrants did before them.",

Ershadur Siddique, current president of the Bangladeshi American Police Association. The department's uniformed ranks are roughly 38% white, 33% Hispanic, 17% Black and nearly 12% Asian, according to NYPD data.",
      "\u201cI never dreamt that I would go this far, but I always had an ambition to go somewhere where I can be challenged,\u201d said Siddique, now a member of Mayor Eric Adams' security detail. \u201cI always say, \u2018Listen, give me a chance, see if I can do better than anybody else,\u2019 you know? Give me a chance.\u201d",
      "Ishmam Chowdhury, a 26-year-old officer who graduated from the academy in May, said Islam\u2019s death just a few months into his own career has left a lasting impression.",
      "Like Islam\u2019s wife, who is expecting their third child, Chowdhury's wife is due to give birth to their first soon.",
      "\u201cIt just hit us a little different because like that made us think, what if it happens to me today? It can,\u201d he said. \u201cSo yeah, I guess that\u2019s a wake-up call for us that even though this is a noble job, we are definitely at grave risk.\u201d",
      "Chowdhury said he dreamed of joining law enforcement even before he immigrated to the U.S. in 2019. As a teenager in Bangladesh, he and other family members were robbed multiple times. The feeling of helplessness and humiliation stuck with him, he said.",
      "Chowdhury started as an unarmed volunteer member of the NYPD auxiliary before joining the civilian ranks as a 911 operator in 2021.",
      "He also served about a year in the police force in Washington, D.C., after it opened applications to green card holders in 2023, but he and his wife felt isolated from friends and family. So after receiving his citizenship last year, the couple moved back to Queens and he enrolled in the police academy.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what makes this city, this country, great. It doesn\u2019t matter where somebody comes from,\u201d Chowdhury said. \u201cIf somebody really works hard and truly wants to do something, they can do it.\u201d",

      "A Congolese refugee who had been separated from her family for eight years was on the verge of joining them in the United States when President Donald Trump halted the refugee program in January",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- The Congolese woman\u2019s search for safety sent her on a terrifying trek of nearly 2,300 miles (3,700 kilometers) through southern Africa on foot when she was just 15.",
      "Reuniting with her family has been a more difficult journey. For eight years, she clung to hope through delays and setbacks as she navigated a U.S. program that reconnects refugees with family members already in the country, and her dream of seeing them again seemed close to becoming a reality.",
      "But President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting the refugee program just hours after he took office on Jan. 20, \u200bleaving her and thousands of other refugees stranded.",
      "\u201cIt was horrible. I would never wish for anyone to go through that, ever. When I think about it, I just ...\u201d she said, pausing to take a long breath. \u201cHonestly, I had given up. I told my mom maybe it was just not meant for us to see each other again.\u201d",
      "During a brief block on the order, the woman made it into the U.S., one of only about 70 refugees to arrive in the country since Trump took office. She asked that her name not be used because she fears retaliation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a really devastating roller coaster for those families, to be stuck in this limbo of not knowing whether their hope of being resettled in the United States will ever come true,\u201d said Melissa Keaney, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project.",
      "The woman was an infant when her mother fled the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s civil war in 1997, seeking shelter at Tanzania\u2019s Nyarugusu refugee camp. When the camp grew too dangerous, she fled for South Africa. She built a modest life there, always hoping she would rejoin her family, even after they were resettled in the U.S. For a time, that seemed likely, thanks to the \u201cfollow to join\u201d program.",
      "The refugee program had bipartisan support for decades, allowing people displaced by war, natural disaster or persecution to legally migrate to the U.S. and providing a pathway to citizenship.",
      "But Trump's executive order halting the program said communities didn\u2019t have the ability to \u201cabsorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees.\u201d",
      "Organizations like the International Refugee Assistance Project and some refugees, including the Congolese woman and her mother, sued over Trump's order in February. They said resettlement agencies were forced to lay off hundreds of workers and some refugees were left in dangerous places.",
      "\u201cI had a small business and told everyone, \u2018I\u2019m out now,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt felt like this door had just been opened, and I was running toward it when \u2014 boom! \u2014 they push it shut right in front of me.\u201d",
      "Looking back on her time in the Nyarugusu refugee camp, she remembers teaching her little brother to ride a bike and whispering with her sister late at night. She remembers hunger and fear as attacks on refugees foraging outside the camp increased.",
      "\u201cYou see someone hanged, and that brings fear,\" she said. \"You don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be next. You don\u2019t know if they\u2019re waiting for you.\u201d",
      "By 2012, the camp was especially dangerous for teen girls, who were at risk of being kidnapped or assaulted. With little hope of a viable future, her mother made a plan: The 15-year-old would walk to South Africa, where she would have a better chance of finishing school and building a life. Her siblings were too young to make the journey, so she would have to go alone.",

      "Louisiana officials have agreed to pay $9 million to a man who was partially paralyzed after a state trooper shot him in the back during a 2018 traffic stop in Baton Rouge",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana authorities have agreed to pay $9 million to a man who was partially paralyzed from the waist down after a trooper shot him in the back during a 2018 traffic stop in Baton Rouge and then falsely reported it as a Taser discharge.",
      "The settlement reached last month is among the largest of its kind in state history and resolves a federal lawsuit by Clifton \u201cScotty\u201d Dilley, whose injuries confined him to a wheelchair when he was 19. The terms of the settlement, which were not made public, were provided to The Associated Press by a person with direct knowledge who was not authorized to disclose them and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The shooting was mentioned in a U.S. Justice Department report this year that found Louisiana State Police used excessive force during arrests and vehicle pursuits.",
      "State police fired Trooper Kasha Domingue after determining she shot Dilley \u201cwithout any reliable justification,\u201d failed to activate her body-worn camera and gave inconsistent accounts that were contradicted by surveillance video.",
      "The agency also found that her misreporting the incident as a tasing \u201cdelayed the appropriate responses to the shooting,\u201d according to records reviewed by AP.",
      "Domingue's explanation for opening fire evolved over the years. Court records show that she alternatively claimed she mistook her firearm for a Taser, pulled the trigger by accident or said the shooting was justified because she feared for her life.",
      "Dilley was a passenger in the vehicle that was pulled over. He said the trooper never ordered him to stop fleeing before shooting. Moments after he was struck, he told Domingue he had lost feeling below his waist.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with my legs?\u2019\u201d Dilley said in a deposition. \u201cShe says, \u2018It\u2019s a Taser aftereffect. It will wear off.\u2019\u201d",
      "In fact, a bullet struck Dilley's spine.",
      "Domingue's initial account fell apart quickly. She told investigators Dilley ran around the stopped vehicle and reached inside it before charging toward her. That claim was contradicted by surveillance video from a nearby store that clearly showed the unarmed man running away from the trooper.",
      "\u201cIf that camera wasn\u2019t there I don\u2019t know how this would\u2019ve turned out,\u201d Dilley said in the deposition.",

Dilley said he hopes the \u201ccase will effect change within the state police that will keep this from ever happening again.\u201d",
      "An attorney for Domingue, Louis Oubre, declined to comment, as did the state Attorney General's Office.",
      "The $9 million settlement is among the largest ever paid in Louisiana in a case involving police violence. Baton Rouge agreed in 2021 to pay $4.5 million to the children of Alton Sterling, a Black man whose fatal shooting by police was captured on video and sparked widespread anger and protests.",
      "More than two years after the shooting, prosecutors charged Domingue with aggravated second-degree battery and illegal use of a weapon. She pleaded guilty in 2022 to obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor, avoiding jail but agreeing never again to serve in law enforcement. Her conviction has since been expunged.",
      "The civil proceedings raised questions about whether Domingue ever should have become a state trooper, underscoring the liability the state could have faced had the lawsuit gone to trial. State police records show a series of red flags dating back to her time in the training academy, including failed tests and issues on the firing range.",
      "The agency allowed her to graduate academy despite those problems, requiring that she complete additional training before receiving her commission. But instructors expressed misgivings about her suitability. One internal report said she \u201cstruggled from the onset of the class, both physically and mentally.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department alluded to Domingue in its findings on the state police's widespread use of excessive force. It noted that she remained a trooper for more than two years after the shooting due to a policy of putting off internal investigations while criminal inquiries are underway.",
      "\u201cThis can add significant delays to the accountability process,\u201d the report said.",
      "Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, criticized the report as an attempt \u201cto diminish the service and exceptionality of\u201d the state police. The federal probe began in 2022 amid fallout from the in-custody death of Ronald Greene, who was beaten, tased and dragged on a rural road in northern Louisiana.",
      "The DOJ rescinded its findings in May, saying it was ending the \u201cfailed experiment of handcuffing local leaders and police departments.\u201d",

      "The threats, pressure and ultimatums have come and gone, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has maintained Moscow's uncompromising demands in the war in Ukraine, raising fears he could use a planned summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska to coerce Kyiv into accepting an unfavorable deal.",
      "The maximalist demands reflect Putin\u2019s determination to reach the goals he set when he launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Putin sees a possible meeting with Trump as a chance to negotiate a broad deal that would not only cement Russia\u2019s territorial gains but also keep Ukraine from joining NATO and hosting any Western troops, allowing Moscow to gradually pull the country back into its orbit.",
      "The Kremlin leader believes time is on his side as the exhausted and outgunned Ukrainian forces are struggling to stem Russian advances in many sectors of the over 1,000-kilometer (over 600-mile) front line while swarms of Russian missiles and drones batter Ukrainian cities.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also has stood firm in his positions, agreeing to a ceasefire proposed by Trump while reaffirming the country's refusal to abandon seeking NATO membership and rejecting acknowledgment of Russia\u2019s annexation of any of its regions.",
      "European leaders, meanwhile, rallied behind Ukraine, saying peace in the war-torn nation can\u2019t be resolved without Kyiv. Zelenskyy thanked European allies in a post on X, writing Sunday: \u201cThe end of the war must be fair, and I am grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine and our people.\u201d",
      "A look at Russian and Ukrainian visions of a peace deal and how a Putin-Trump summit could evolve:",
      "In a memorandum presented at talks in Istanbul in June, Russia offered Ukraine two options for establishing a 30-day ceasefire. One demanded Ukraine withdraw its forces from Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 the four regions Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully captured.",
      "As an alternate condition for a ceasefire, Russia made a \u201cpackage proposal\u201d for Ukraine to halt mobilization efforts, freeze Western arms deliveries and ban any third-country forces on its soil. Moscow also suggested Ukraine end martial law and hold elections, after which the countries could sign a comprehensive peace treaty.",
      "Once there's a truce, Moscow wants a deal to include the \u201cinternational legal recognition\u201d of its annexations of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and the four regions in 2022.",
      "Russia says a peace treaty should have Ukraine declare its neutral status between Russia and the West, abandon its bid to join NATO, limit the size of its armed forces and recognize Russian as an official language on par with Ukrainian -\u2013 conditions reflecting Putin\u2019s earliest goals.",
      "It also demands Ukraine ban the \u201cglorification and propaganda of Nazism and neo-Nazism\u201d and dissolve nationalist groups. Since the war began, Putin has falsely alleged that neo-Nazi groups were shaping Ukrainian politics under Zelenskyy, who is Jewish. They were fiercely dismissed by Kyiv and its Western allies.",
      "In Russia\u2019s view, a comprehensive peace treaty should see both countries lift all sanctions and restrictions, abandon any claims to compensation for wartime damage, resume trade and communications, and reestablish diplomatic ties.",
      "Asked Thursday whether Moscow has signaled any willingness to compromise to make a meeting with Trump possible, Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov responded that there haven't been any shifts in the Russian position.",
      "The memorandum that Ukraine presented to Moscow in Istanbul emphasized the need for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to set stage for peace negotiations.",
      "It reaffirmed Ukraine\u2019s consistent rejection of Russian demands for neutral status as an attack on its sovereignty, declaring it is free to choose its alliances and adding that its NATO membership will depend on consensus with the alliance.",

      "Kyiv's peace proposal also demanded the return of all deported and illegally displaced children and a total prisoner exchange.",
      "It held the door open to gradual lifting of some of the sanctions against Russia if it abides by the agreement.",
      "Trump has often spoken admiringly of Putin and even echoed his talking points on the war. He had a harsh confrontation with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office on Feb. 28, but later warmed his tone. As Putin resisted a ceasefire and continued his aerial bombardments, Trump showed exasperation with the Kremlin leader, threatening Moscow with new sanctions.",
      "Although Trump expressed disappointment with Putin, his agreement to meet him without Zelenskyy at the table raised worries in Ukraine and its European allies, who fear it could allow the Russian to get Trump on his side and strong-arm Ukraine into concessions.",
      "Trump said without giving details that \u201cthere'll be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both\u201d Russia and Ukraine as part of any peace deal that he will discuss with Putin when they meet Friday.",
      "Putin repeatedly warned Ukraine will face tougher conditions for peace if it doesn't accept Moscow's demands as Russian troops forge into other regions to build what he described as a \u201cbuffer zone.\u201d Some observers suggested Russia could trade those recent gains for the territories of the four annexed by Moscow still under Ukrainian control.",
      "\u201cThat is potentially a situation that gives Putin a tremendous amount of leeway as long as he can use that leverage to force the Ukrainians into a deal that they may not like and to sideline the Europeans effectively,\u201d Sam Greene of King\u2019s College London said. \u201cThe question is, will Trump sign up to that and will he actually have the leverage to force the Ukrainians and the Europeans to accept it?\u201d",
      "Putin could accept a temporary truce to win Trump\u2019s sympathy as he seeks to achieve broader goals, Greene said.",
      "\u201cHe could accept a ceasefire so long as it\u2019s one that leaves him in control, in which there\u2019s no real deterrence against renewed aggression somewhere down the line,\u201d he said. \u201cHe understands that his only route to getting there runs via Trump.\"",
      "In a possible indication he thinks a ceasefire or peace deal could be close, Putin called the leaders of China, India, South Africa and several ex-Soviet nations in an apparent effort to inform these allies about prospective agreements.",
      "Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center argued Putin wouldn\u2019t budge on his goals.",
      "\u201cHowever these conditions are worded, they amount to the same demand: Ukraine stops resisting, the West halts arms supplies, and Kyiv accepts Russia\u2019s terms, which effectively amount to a de facto capitulation,\u201d she posted on X. \u201cThe Russian side can frame this in a dozen different ways, creating the impression that Moscow is open to concessions and serious negotiation. It has been doing so for some time, but the core position remains unchanged: Russia wants Kyiv to surrender.\u201d",
      "She predicted Putin might agree to meet Zelenskyy but noted the Kremlin leader would only accept such a meeting \u201cif there is a prearranged agenda and predetermined outcomes, which remains difficult to imagine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe likely scenario is that this peace effort will fail once again,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would be a negative outcome for Ukraine, but it would not deliver Ukraine to Putin on a plate either, at least not in the way he wants it. The conflict, alternating between open warfare and periods of simmering tension, appears likely to persist for the foreseeable future.\u201d",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "When astronaut James Lovell (March 25, 1928-Aug. 7, 2025) was launched aboard Apollo 8, just four days before Christmas 1968, NASA's flight director believed they only had a 50% chance of coming home safely. \"Some of the odds of trying to be successful in that mission are overwhelming, and perhaps at that time we didn't even understand what the odds were,\" Lovell told \"CBS Evening News\" in 2018.",
      "That Christmas Eve, they became the first human crew to circle the moon. \"We're like three schoolkids looking into a candy store window, watching those ancient old craters on the far side, slowly slip underneath us,\" Lovell told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018.",
      "But the truly moving sight was when they viewed their home planet rise above the surface. \"I could put my thumb up to the window, and completely hide the Earth,\" Lovell said. \"You have to think about that \u2013 over five billion people, everything I ever knew, was behind my thumb!\"",
      "A U.S. Naval Academy graduate and test pilot, Lovell joined the space program in 1962, becoming one of NASA's most traveled astronauts during its first decade. Lovell flew into space four times: aboard Gemini 7, Gemini 12, Apollo 8 and Apollo 13.",
      "It was that last mission, in 1970, that proved the most harrowing. Apollo 13's service module, carrying Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, experienced a sudden oxygen tank explosion on its way to the moon. \"Houston, we've had a problem,\" Swigert and Lovell radioed.",
      "With the landing mission scrapped, Lovell and his crewmates moved into the cramped lunar lander to use as a lifeboat, as hundreds of flight controllers and engineers worked to guide the damaged spacecraft back home. With the crew's life support dwindling, the world watched gripped in suspense over their four-day journey back to Earth.",
      "Lovell's calm demeanor during the mission (which was dramatized in the film \"Apollo 13,\" starring Tom Hanks) fixed his public image, underscoring the heroism of astronauts working in the deadly environment of space. Though disappointed he never got to walk on the moon, Lovell understood that, in some ways, the failed mission was a success. \"Going to the moon, if everything works right, it's like following a cookbook. It's not that big a deal,\" he told the AP in 2004. \"If something goes wrong, that's what separates the men from the boys.\""

    "published": "Sun, 10 Aug 2025 10:36:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Billy Wilder's caustic tale of Hollywood, obsession and murder, in which a fading star of silent pictures tries to recreate her fame, is back in its full dark glory.",
    "story": [
      "There are some movies where just about every line is quotable. Take Billy Wilder's 1950 masterpiece \"Sunset Boulevard,\" which premiered 75 years ago this month.",
      "Gillis: \"You're Norma Desmond. You used to be in silent pictures. You used to be big.\"Desmond: \"I AM big. It's the pictures that got small.\"",
      "The film was anything but small! The legendary director had Gloria Swanson as the rejected silent film star, Norma Desmond, who seemed to be going quietly out of her mind; and William Holden as the failed screenwriter Joe Gillis, who became her kept man.",
      "\"She was 52 at the time; William Holden was 31,\" said UT Austin film professor Noah Isenberg. \"The age difference was extraordinary. Today we might not think much of it, but it was big.\"",
      "Isenberg says the noir \"Sunset Boulevard\" tested the limits of what a 1950 audience would bear. The opening scene is gruesome enough, with the murdered Gillis face down in a swimming pool. But the film originally started in the L.A. morgue, with Gillis and other cadavers talking about how they got there. \u00a0Isenberg said, \"It was too dark, too morbid. Audiences weren't ready for it. Instead, you have John Seitz's camera trained on that curb.\" Appropriately, the film begins in the gutter.",
      "The original film, now restored in glorious 4K ultra hi-def, is available from Paramount.",
      "Nancy Olson was only 21 when she played aspiring writer Betty Schaefer opposite Holden's Gillis. Olson, now 97, says Holden's air of desperation in the film mirrored what was happening in his life. \"His career was dying,\" she said. \"And that's the character. If you look carefully, you will see one of the most extraordinary, real performances of a man who gave up his soul for survival.\"",
      "Still, Olson says they got along famously on set, especially when director Wilder lined them up for their first-ever love scene in a crowded studio where some of the cast's family members happened to be present: \"And we got to the end, where Bill says to my character, 'What happened?' And I turn to him slowly and answer, 'You did.' Whereupon he takes me into his arms and gently starts to kiss me.",
      "\"Now, Billy said, 'Do not separate until I say cut.' And we both were enjoying this. And all of a sudden, there was a female voice saying, 'Cut, damn it! Cut!' It was Mrs. Holden! I never got over it. But I learned something.\"",
      "What was that? \"Bill and I loved to kiss!\"",
      "And moviegoers loved the film: \"Sunset Boulevard\" got 11 Academy Award nominations. \"I was shocked,\" Olsen said of the Oscar nods. \"Now, we didn't win. But we've outlasted everybody.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for the 75th anniversary release of \"Sunset Boulevard\" click on the video player below:",
      "\"Sunset Boulevard\" was later re-born as a musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber. Sir Andrew was intrigued by the story of Hollywood discarding aging stars, and got the blessing of Wilder, who by then was being gently phased out of Hollywood himself \u2013 in his own way getting the Norma Desmond treatment. Webber said, \"He does tell a wonderful story about him going to see some young movie executive who had just been there. And this young executive says to him, 'Um, well, Mr. Wilder, we're very impressed by this screenplay that you've done, but it would be really helpful if you could tell me what you have done in the past?'\"",
      "The director of such classics as \"Double Indemnity,\" \"The Lost Weekend,\" \"Ace in the Hole,\" \"Some Like It Hot,\" and \"The Apartment,\" turned to the young executive and said, \"You first.\"",
      "\"Sunset Boulevard,\" the musical, opened in London's West End in 1993, with Patti LuPone as Desmond; when they brought the show to Los Angeles and New York, Glenn Close played the lead.",
      "And in the latest, radically re-conceived version, Desmond was played by former pop star Nicole Scherzinger.",
      "Asked about seeing Scherzinger in the role of Norma Desmond, Webber said, \"I have always rated Nicole as one of the most astounding singers I've ever worked with. And I worked with a few. And I could say that Nicole is right up there with the very, very, very top ones, might even be the best.\"",
      "Scherzinger brought a new level of intensity to Norma Desmond, and took home a Tony Award this year.",
      "You can stream the Broadway cast album of \"Sunset Blvd.\" featuring Nicole Scherzinger by clicking on the embed below (Free Spotify registration required to hear the tracks in full):",
      "The show closed last month, and we took Scherzinger back to the St. James Theatre just before they took down all the signs. \"I can't believe that this is still up; I want to take it home!\" she laughed. \"I want to take it home and I want to put this in my garage.\"",
      "One sign was half-removed from the stage door. \"I think someone stole my face!\" she laughed.",
      "Asked what she thinks \"Sunset Boulevard\" says about the entertainment industry and its treatment of older women, Scherzinger said, \"It's difficult that the industry kind of puts an expiration date on you when you've actually lived a life and actually, finally, have something really meaningful to say.\"",
      "Hollywood has changed (and so has Paramount Pictures). But seventy-five years on, \"Sunset Boulevard\" still holds up. Isenberg said, \"For people who love movies \u2013 cinephiles and film geeks, whatever we want to call them today \u2013 you can just luxuriate in a movie like 'Sunset Boulevard.' It's like a warm bath.\"",
      "Gloria Swanson herself luxuriated in playing a faded movie queen. Even back then, she somehow knew that \"Sunset Boulevard\" would make her a legend.",
      "Asked if Swanson was anything like the character she portrayed, Nancy Olson replied, \"No. She was much more real and sensible. And she was the only person on the entire set that understood that this movie would live forever and that she would be remembered forever \u2013 that it was a story that had a truth to it that would never be forgotten.\"",

      "The rainbow theme won't disappear entirely, but the ribbon for the lifetime achievement medallion will likely to be redesigned \u2014 possibly with a black or gold ribbon.",
      "The Honors weekend will be revamped, with a more streamlined schedule instead of multiple gatherings at the State Department, the White House and elsewhere, sources said. The events were expensive and time-consuming, and honorees sometimes skipped portions of the non-televised events.",
      "After criticizing the Kennedy Center's artistic fare and its finances, President Trump earlier this year named himself as its chairman, longtime aide and supporter Richard Grenell as its president and several White House officials and Trump allies as board members. That triggered a number of artists to cancel performances and some staff members resigned.",

    "summary": "An ICE spokesperson ICE Assistant Secretary confirmed that Dean Cain will be sworn in as an honorary ICE officer in the coming month.",
    "story": [
      "Dean Cain, the actor known for his role as television's Superman throughout the 1990s, announced Wednesday that he intends to enlist as an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, just hours after the agency announced it would waive age limits for new applicants.",
      "ICE Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News that Cain will be sworn in as an honorary ICE officer in the coming month.",
      "On Tuesday, Cain posted on social media to advertise career opportunities at ICE, saying he \"felt it was important to join with our first responders to help secure the safety of all Americans, not just talk about it.\" A day later, Cain appeared as a guest on \"Jesse Waters Primetime,\" where he told the Fox News host that he spoke to ICE officials after Tuesday's video gained traction online and that he \"will be sworn in as an ICE agent ASAP.\"",
      "The 59-year-old actor's statements came a month after the Trump administration bumped up incentives for new ICE officers, as the agency works to fill the 10,000 vacancies created by a massive federal funding surge. On Wednesday, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced that ICE was waiving age limits in its search for new applicants.",
      "The move isn't the first foray into law enforcement for Cain, who played Superman and Clark Kent in the 1990s TV show \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.\" In 2019, Cain enlisted as a reserve officer in the Pocatello Police Department, a precinct in Brannock County, Idaho. The Michigan native has also joined up as a sworn sheriff's deputy in Frederick County, Virginia.",
      "Cain appeared on the television series \"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\" from 1993 to 1997. He later returned to the DC universe in guest roles on later Superman series, including \"Smallville\" and \"Supergirl.\" His last television appearance was in Showtime's \"The Curse,\" alongside Emma Stone and Nathan Fielder.",
      "The actor last month criticized James Gunn's rebooted \"Superman\" film, which stars David Corenswet as the man of steel. Cain dubbed the film \"woke\" after Gunn referred to the character as \"an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country.\"",
      "\"I think that was a mistake by James Gunn to say it's an immigrant thing,\" Cain told TMZ in July. \"I'm rooting for it to be a success, but I don't like that last political comment.\"",
      "Wednesday's announcement wasn't Cain's first collaboration with U.S. immigration officials. In a 1997 episode of \"Lois & Clark,\" titled \"Meet John Doe,\" Cain's Superman is confronted by what was then known as an immigration and naturalization officer, who corners the Kryptonian and demands that he shows his green card \u2013 but he cannot.",

      "\"In terms of the, you know, the drugs and the other stuff \u2026 that's what makes it a modern love story,\" he said. \"I think they really did love each other. I think she very much loved him and I know he very much loved her.\"",

    "summary": "Instagram rolled out a new Map feature that lets users see their friends' locations in real time. Here's why privacy experts are concerned.",
    "story": [
      "A new feature on Instagram that let's users share their real-time physical location with others on the app has privacy experts concerned over the amount of data exposed and potential safety risks to users.",
      "Called Instagram Map, the new feature was introduced on Thursday as part of an app update. On its blog, the company says the location-sharing tool makes it \"easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you're enjoying on Instagram.\"",
      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "summary": "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of a deadly food-poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, but recent reports point to ongoing sanitation problems.",
    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",
      "In the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.",
      "\"I think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\" Kowalcyk said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday, after he fired the former commissioner earlier this month, blaming her for a weaker-than-expected jobs report.",
      "Antoni is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, and he holds a doctorate in economics from Northern Illinois University. He has criticized the BLS in the past for low response rates and questioned the agency's methodology, calling its health insurance figures \"phoney baloney\" last year and at one point joking that \"the 'L' is silent\" in BLS' name.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0X post.",
      "\"There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data\u2014that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\" he wrote shortly after Mr. Trump fired the former BLS chief.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Antoni in a Truth Social post, saying he \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "Antoni will need to be confirmed by the Senate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is currently led by acting Commissioner William Watrowski, who has worked at the agency for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to terminate Erika McEntarfer, who had been commissioner of labor statistics, on Aug. 1, hours after the release of the July jobs report data. That report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, along with a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "Hours before her firing, Antoni criticized BLS for \"data problems\" and a trend of \"highly problematic\" revisions, though he also touted some figures in the July jobs report, including a jump in employment by native-born Americans and a slowdown in government jobs.",
      "In the wake of McEntarfer's firing, influential ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon backed Antoni to take over the BLS. Antoni appeared on Bannon's show \"War Room\" on the day the jobs report came out, calling McEntarfer \"incompetent.\" Days later, Bannon said \"we're pushing\" for Antoni to lead the BLS, and called him \"the guy that almost single-handedly took it down by going through their numbers.\"",
      "Announcing McEntarfer's firing in a post on Truth Social, the president claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that she had \"faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory\" and pledged to replace her \"with someone much more competent and qualified.\"",
      "The jobs report for October 2024, which was released on Nov. 1, 2024, four days before Election Day, showed just 12,000 jobs were created \u2014 far short of the 100,000 forecast for the month \u2014 following two hurricanes and a major labor dispute. The following month, that figure was revised upward, to 36,000. September's jobs report, however, dramatically exceeded forecasts \u2014 254,000 jobs were created, rather than the 140,000 economic analysts had expected. That figure was later revised down to 223,000.",
      "Mr. Trump continued railing against the ousted commissioner and the BLS more broadly in the days after he fired her, claiming in a post on Truth Social last week that the July jobs report had been \"RIGGED,\" though he provided no evidence to support it. The president said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Tuesday that it's a \"highly political situation.\" And National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's decision in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing a series of revisions and patterns that \"could make people wonder.\"",
      "\"What we need is a fresh set of eyes over at the BLS,\" Hassett said, adding that \"the president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers they're more transparent and more reliable.\"",
      "McEntarfer had been commissioner for a little over a year and a half, after she was confirmed in a broad bipartisan vote of 86 to 8 by the Senate in January 2024.",
      "The latest jobs report showed employers in July adding a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, with a downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June. Mr. Trump, who often touts the job numbers, called the jobs figures a \"shock\" and the revision a \"major mistake.\" The BLS said in its report that monthly revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged in an interview for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"there are always revisions,\" but he added that \"sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\"",
      "\"The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "Meanwhile, some economists and lawmakers have expressed concern over the firing, and a group of former BLS leaders warned that the move \"undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff\" and \"escalates the President's unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.\" The group called on Congress to investigate the firing.",

    "summary": "President Trump has extended a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, preventing tariffs on China from leaping to at least 80%.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying a set of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for at least 90 days, extending a ceasefire in the U.S.-China trade war, the White House announced.",
      "The president's order will keep tariffs at 30% \u2014 the level that was set in mid-May, when both countries agreed to temporarily back off a set of tit-for-tat tariffs that exceeded 100%. That agreement was set to expire Tuesday, and without an extension, levies on some Chinese goods could have leaped to at least 80%, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.",
      "The order says the U.S.'s \"reciprocal\" tariff on Chinese goods will remain at 10% until at least Nov. 10. An additional 20% tariff on China that was imposed earlier this year due to fentanyl trafficking is\u00a0also still in place, bringing the total rate to 30%.",
      "\"The United States and China have engaged in multiple rounds of productive negotiations to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns,\" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the extension.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that China and the U.S. were \"likely\" to agree to a 90-day extension as the two countries seek to negotiate a longer-term trade deal. Mr. Trump told reporters earlier Monday those negotiations were going \"quite nicely.\" Representatives from both sides met in Stockholm late last month.",
      "Greer told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"I don't think anyone wants to see\" high tariffs on China snap back.",
      "\"We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it,\" Greer said. \"I think it's going in a positive direction.\"",
      "A return to high tariffs could have caused U.S. imports of Chinese goods to plummet, disrupting trade between the world's two largest economies. In mid-April, when tariffs on Chinese imports still stood at 145%, the Trump administration planned for possible supply chain disruptions.",
      "China was the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner last year, not counting the European Union. The U.S. imported $438.9 billion in Chinese goods and China imported $143.5 billion in American goods, according to U.S. government data.",
      "Mr. Trump first hit China with 34% tariffs in early April, one of dozens of countries to face hefty \"reciprocal\" levies. The president argues tariffs could boost U.S. manufacturers and correct what he views as unfair trade practices, but many economists warn Mr. Trump's trade strategy could lead to higher consumer prices and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president quickly paused his April tariffs for most countries, and reinstated them, often at substantially lower levels, last week. But the China levies remained in place for more than a month and drew retaliation from Beijing, ultimately pushing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 125%.",
      "The two countries agreed to ease the tariffs for at least 90 days in May, buying more time for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's teams to negotiate a trade deal. Since then, the U.S. has charged 30% tariffs and China has charged 10%.",
      "The talks have occasionally proven contentious. Earlier this year, the two countries feuded over Beijing's restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductors and the Trump administration's crackdown on international students from China. Mr. Trump accused China of violating the terms of the May truce \u2014 though both countries reached a deal to ease some of those tensions in June. And on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed China to quadruple its imports of U.S. soybeans.",

      "\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.",

      "AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Stocks for both companies rose slightly on Monday.",

      "Ford's first EV from the new system",
      "The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a \"frunk\" \u2014 a front storage compartment \u2014 as well as a pickup truck bed.",
      "The vehicle will start at $30,000. By comparison, the average price for a new electric vehicle in July was about $56,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",
      "Field touted the new vehicle's charging capabilities, referring to the truck as a \"mobile power plant.\"",
      "\"Outlets in the back can give you high power and let you plug in anything from tools to a refrigerator, and it can provide backup power for your home,\" he said.",
      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions. A report from the Anderson Economic Group shows pickup trucks drivers in New York, California and Michigan face \"significantly higher costs\" if they rely on an EV.",
      "A successfully lower-cost truck model, however, could spur a new chapter for the company in its manufacturing of EVs.",
      "\"If Ford shows the industry it can build and sell a reliable compact EV truck for $30,000, it will sell a lot of them, and open the door to making sedans using the new production process,\" Anderson said.",

Overseeing the opening is The Brand House Collective, formerly known as Kirkland's, which manages a portfolio of retail stores including Beyond Inc.'s Bed Bath & Beyond Home, Bed Bath & Beyond, Buy Buy Baby and Overstock.",
      "\"We will be testing and learning the right inventory mix by category and by brand, but the look and feel of the stores will be a transition from the original Bed Bath and Beyond stores with a tighter focus on Seasonal Home Decor, Bedroom furnishings, and Bath and Laundry products,\" Starr Hudgens, chief of staff at the Brand House Collective, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Brand House Collective\u00a0announced the opening of the Nashville store late last month.",

      "Asked whether Brand House plans to open more stores under the Bed Bath & Beyond Home moniker, Hudgens said, \"We are opening four additional Bed Bath and Beyond Home stores in the Nashville market and will be in an aggressive learn and react posture to determine appropriate merchandising, brand, and strategy shifts to make as we plan our opening strategy for 2026.\"",
      "The opening of the Nashville location marks a new chapter for the discount retailer which struggled to stay afloat amid depressed sales and the takeoff of online shopping. The company finally got into the e-commerce game after naming Mark Tritton, a former top Target executive, as CEO in 2019. But by then the company was too far behind top competitors, according to experts.",
      "The company had over 300 brick-and-mortar locations before closing all of them after it\u00a0entered Chapter 11 proceedings in April 2023. Months later, it announced it would return as an online home furnishings brand under its new owner Overstock.com.

    "summary": "While many Americans are still baffled by cryptocurrency, enthusiasm for these digital assets is growing - despite the potential risks of integrating digital currencies with the mainstream economy - in part due to support coming from the White House.",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, more than 35,000 bitcoin enthusiasts descended on Las Vegas for Bitcoin 2025 \u2013 the largest-ever gathering of its kind, attracting an eclectic mix of high rollers ... and true believers.",
      "\"Your goal should be to own at least one bitcoin, because by the time you retire, that can be worth 20, 30 million,\" said Michael Terpin.",
      "Guy Malone said, \"You can't change the Bible; it changes you. The same is true of bitcoin.\"",
      "But everyone here seems to agree on one thing: President Donald Trump's reelection has been like hitting the jackpot. As Vice President JD Vance told the crowd, \"I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House.\"",
      "Once dismissed by investors, and still baffling to many Americans, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have won over supporters from Wall Street to Washington. In July, the president signed the Genius Act, which opens the door for companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon to issue their own digital currencies.",
      "And Congress is debating another bill that, for the first time, aims to regulate cryptocurrency trading \u2013 this after the industry spent more than $167 million on behalf of crypto-friendly candidates ahead of last year's election.",
      "Asked how people should think of cryptocurrencies, Amanda Fischer, who served as a top official in the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden administration, replied, \"You could think of it as gambling, you could think of it as a collectible, you could think of it as a type of investment. But I think what's important to understand is that crypto is highly volatile. It's highly speculative.",
      "\"Crypto is often marketed to individuals as an investment opportunity that will yield them the possibility of great returns,\" she said. \"But unlike, say, a stock, which represents a part-ownership of a company, [crypto] is not backed by any sort of business that is producing goods and services.\"",
      "Unlike hard currencies like the dollar or the euro, cryptocurrencies only exist online, and are issued by individuals and companies, not central banks. And yet, billions of dollars' worth of crypto are traded every day. \"The number of scams, the types of scams, the sophistication of scams are so rife and plentiful that the capacity to lose your money in a crypto investment is substantially higher than if you're just investing in stocks and bonds,\" Fischer said.",
      "During the Biden administration, the SEC cracked down on the cryptocurrency industry. The Trump administration has changed course, dismissing the largest outstanding cases, which Fischer says leaves consumers more vulnerable.",
      "I asked, \"We are seeing leaders in crypto say we want to be regulated. And there is legislation currently here in Washington underway to regulate cryptocurrency. They say they want laws passed.\"",
      "\"They want laws that they write to be passed,\" said Fischer. \"So, the legislation currently being considered in Washington, D.C., is written by and for the crypto industry.\"",
      "David Bailey, who runs the bitcoin conference and is CEO of a bitcoin holding company called Nakamoto, said, \"I wish that was the case, that'd be fantastic. But no, it's not true.\"",
      "The rise of digital assets",
      "Like many crypto entrepreneurs, Bailey now calls Puerto Rico home. \"It started because of the taxes,\" he said. \"Now, it's like the place to do business.\"",
      "But the 34-year-old's real claim to fame might be his role in convincing a skeptical President Trump (who in June 2021 told Fox Business Channel that bitcoin \"just seems like a scam\") to go all-in on bitcoin during the 2024 campaign. Asked what he told Mr. Trump to convince him to support crypto, Bailey replied, \"First off, no one convinces the president of anything. He makes up his own mind about things. A lot of people, especially in Washington, have missed how big this has gotten. And so, we made the case to the president about how many people hold this asset. He saw the opportunity that was here by embracing this industry. And I think we had a big part of swinging the election in his direction.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve says only eight percent of Americans have bought or held cryptocurrency in the last year, and only two percent have ever used it to buy anything. But digital assets are increasingly part of the economy. You may now be able to use crypto as collateral for a mortgage, and this past week the president signed an executive order to make it easier to hold cryptocurrencies in your 401(k).",
      "All the attention has helped drive the price of bitcoin to an all-time high, recently passing $120,000 each.",
      "Bailey says bitcoin was about $10 when he first bought it. Asked how much he bought, he replied, \"Well, you know, that's something I'm not going to talk about on camera. Not enough, let's just go like that. Not enough.\"",
      "And as crypto's fortunes have improved, so have the president's; CBS News estimates that crypto ventures controlled by the Trump family have made up to $765 million in revenue from token sales since the fall of 2024.",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about the token sales, but in a statement told CBS News, \"Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Most experts in government ethics believe the situation is unprecedented.",
      "I asked Bailey, \"Has it ever occurred to you that maybe the president has changed his position on bitcoin and crypto because he can personally benefit from it, or his family can?\"",
      "\"No, absolutely not,\" said Bailey. \"I don't think he embraced this industry to enrich himself; I think that he just sees the same potential that I see. When you get excited about an idea, you feel compelled to do something about it.\"",
      "Trump Media buys $2 billion in bitcoin as it pursues crypto treasury strategy",
      "Trump Media buys $2 billion in bitcoin as it pursues crypto treasury strategy",
      "And that potential is why investors are betting that crypto will soon become part of everyday life. Vice President Vance told the audience at Bitcoin 2025, \"We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets, and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy and are here to stay.\"",
      "But for Amanda Fischer, that's a gamble not worth taking.",
      "\"We heard the same thing about subprime mortgages going into 2008,\" said Fischer. \"We heard the same thing about complex financial derivatives going into the last crisis, too. These products are wonderful and there are ways to extract so much value in wealth, until they're not. And I fear that crypto is going to follow down the same path. Things are going great many times, until they're not.\"",

    "story": [
      "The federal government told Harvard University on Friday it could take control of the school's patents stemming from federally funded research \u2014 the latest in a months-long feud between the Trump administration and the Ivy League college.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is launching an \"immediate comprehensive review\" of whether Harvard has complied with federal laws around patents, he said in a letter to Harvard President Alan Garber.",
      "The patents in question could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, a senior administration official said, and in his letter, Lutnick threatened to grant third-party licenses to Harvard's patents or take the titles to any patents where Harvard has failed to comply with government title and disclosure requirements.",
      "Lutnick ordered the Massachusetts-based school to provide information on all patents that it obtained through federally funded research.",
      "\"We believe that Harvard has failed to live up to its obligations to the American taxpayer and is in breach of the statutory, regulatory, and contractual requirements tied to Harvard's federally funded research programs and intellectual property arising therefrom,\" Lutnick said.",
      "He gave Harvard until Sept. 5 to respond and prove it's complying with the Bayh-Dole Act. Under that legislation, universities receiving federal research grants have to show that inventions issuing from that funding are being used to benefit Americans.",
      "The Trump administration wants Harvard to provide a list of all the patents it has that stem from federal grants, how the patents are currently being applied and details about licensing agreements, including whether they mandate \"substantial U.S. manufacturing\" and the identities of the licensees.",
      "A Harvard spokesperson called the move \"yet another retaliatory effort targeting Harvard for defending its rights and freedom.\"",
      "\"Technologies and patents developed at Harvard are life-saving and industry-redefining. We are fully committed to complying with the Bayh-Dole Act and ensuring that the public is able to access and benefit from the many innovations that arise out of federally funded research at Harvard,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The Trump administration has paused or cut off billions in federal research funding to Harvard, accusing the university of failing to deal with campus antisemitism. Harvard has\u00a0sued over the funding freezes, alleging the government is illegally punishing the school for First Amendment-protected activity and trying to \"force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs.\"",
      "Before the funding cutoff, the administration\u00a0demanded that Harvard agree to changes\u00a0\u2014 including an external audit of certain academic departments, an end to DEI programs and stricter disciplinary policies \u2014 if it wants to maintain its \"financial relationship\" with the federal government. Harvard rejected the demands.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that he says will democratize alternative investments for workers saving for retirement.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump says he wants to democratize retirement by allowing 401(k)s to invest in so-called alternative investments, or strategies outside stocks and other traditional investments, such as private equity and cryptocurrencies.",
      "The executive order signed by Mr. Trump on Thursday would open the door to higher-risk investments landing in your 401(k). It could also potentially serve as a game changer for the $5 trillion private equity industry, which for years has wanted to gain access to America's retirement plans.",
      "The move has the potential to shake up the typically staid menu of investment choices provided to workers through their employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans, which include 401(k)s and 403(b)s, with the latter aimed at teachers. The change might appeal to some savers, given that alternative investments can provide protection from market swings while also providing the potential for outsized returns.\u00a0But there are several catches to be aware of, experts say.",
      "Alternative investments such as private equity and cryptocurrencies \"have matured into a strong-performing asset class delivering excellent long-term returns, so this is good news for Americans,\" Simon Tang, head of U.S. at Accelex, a private markets specialist, said in an email.",
      "But there are caveats, experts say. For one, some alternative investments carry higher risk profiles than traditional asset classes, and offer less transparency about their performance on a day-to-day basis. It's also unclear whether or not employers will want to offer such investments given the risks.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the executive order change about 401(k)s?",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under\u00a0401(k) retirement\u00a0rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, a law better known as\u00a0ERISA. Under that regulation, employers are required to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Workers would still be able to limit their investments to traditional assets like stocks and bonds, and would also be able to opt out of adding new alternative strategies to their portfolios.",
      "When could those changes become effective?",
      "It's unclear, but it's likely going to take months or even longer given the complexity of ERISA.",
      "After the Labor Department provides its new guidance, it will take time for major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity and Vanguard to develop appropriate funds for employers to use.",
      "Employers will also likely need time to revise their retirement plan options, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity become mainstream investments in individual retirement plans. Whether employers and their workers will opt to invest in these asset classes is another question, experts added.",
      "\"While asset managers are salivating over the idea of tapping in to a portion of the $12.5 trillion in defined contribution assets, we believe adoption will be slow due to cost, transparency and complexity,\" said Pitchbook analysts in a report written to provide an analysis of some aspects of Mr. Trump's order.",
      "How risky are these investments?",
      "All investments carry risks, but alternative asset classes come with additional pitfalls that heighten their potential for volatility. For instance, private equity invests in companies that are not publicly traded, which makes it difficult to know on a day-to-day basis whether the investment is up, down or sideways.",
      "\"When it comes to investing in stocks, retail investors are used to instant pricing, clean data and daily performance updates,\" Tang said. \"Private markets are a different ballgame. There's no real-time information, no ticker and no standardization, just fragmented documents and unstructured formats.\"",
      "Cryptocurrencies, for their part, may have more transparency on pricing, but they can also be extremely volatile, with major shifts in valuation from day to day. That said, cryptocurrencies have grown increasingly popular, with about 1 in 4 people investing in crypto, according to Security.org.",
      "Do alternative investments outperform stocks and bonds?",
      "Alternative investments can outperform stocks and bonds, but there's no guarantee.",
      "For instance, bitcoin last year jumped 135% in value, compared with a 24% increase in the S&P 500. But in 2022, it was another story, with bitcoin dropping 65% while the S&P 500 lost 19%, one analysis shows.",
      "Private equity investments, meanwhile, returned 13.5% over a 10-year period, outpacing the 9.7% return for stocks and a 1.9% for bonds over the same period, according to a recent study.",
      "While the potential for outsized gains may appeal to some investors, alternative investments also tend to carry higher costs, such as pricier fees for fund managers, which can eat into returns.",
      "\"Higher costs come from the fact that while you can trade a stock for pennies, it requires travel, negotiations, legal work, and much more, to buy and operate a private company. These costs are typically passed along to fund investors,\" Pitchbook said.",

      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wendy's cut its sales outlook Friday, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Company executives discussed Wendy's challenges during a call with analysts Friday, following the release of its latest earnings report. Interim CEO Ken Cook said that in light of the current environment, the company now expects full-year global sales to decline between 3% and 5%, compared with previous\u00a0projections\u00a0of flat to down 2%.",
      "Wendy's is coping with softer consumer demand in 2025, particularly among the lower-income customers that tend to frequent fast-food chains, Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" she said.",
      "Fast food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "Cook, who stepped in as interim CEO after former Wendy's CEO Kirk Tanner departed to lead the Hershey Company, cited \"a combination of dynamic consumer behavior and a more challenging competitive environment\" during a Friday call with analysts to discuss the results.",
      "While sales improved in May and June due to new Frosty offerings, \"overall demand recovered more slowly than we expected,\" he added. The burger chain's sales slipped 1.8% to $3.7 billion in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the company's earnings report.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers who are skipping breakfast could signal this growing pressure, with Wendy's executives highlighting the trend.",
      "\"Breakfast continued to perform worse than rest of day in the second quarter, which makes sense when you look at what's happening from a consumer behavior perspective,\" Cook said. \"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they that they do that with.\"",
      "Meanwhile, McDonald's, which last year saw a sales slowdown from low-income consumers, reversed that trend following its decision to\u00a0expand its value menu. CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts earlier in the week that value items \u2014 which include its $2.99 Snack Wrap \u2014 are bringing some consumers back to its stores even as fast food visits across the industry have slowed.",
      "Senatore said Wendy's provides good values for price-conscious consumers, but added the chain may not be communicating that as effectively as its competitors. \"McDonald's has done a good job of marketing value, and that is something that Wendy's acknowledged that they needed to do,\" she said.",
      "Among other value offerings is the Wendy's Biggie Bag, which features a junior bacon cheeseburger, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a soft drink for $5.",
      "Asked about adjusting core menu pricing during Friday's call, Cook said the company plans to use new data analytics capabilities to evaluate its prices.",

      "Washington \u2014 Billy Long, the commissioner of the IRS, is leaving his post after just two months on the job.",
      "President Trump will nominate Long to serve as ambassador to Iceland, the outgoing IRS commissioner said in a statement confirming the news, which was first reported by\u00a0The New York Times.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will lead the IRS temporarily, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "\"I am thrilled to answer his call to service and deeply committed to advancing his bold agenda,\" Long said in his statement. \"Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "In his last mass email to the IRS's workforce on Thursday, Long told agency employees they could leave 70 minutes early on Friday, two staffers told CBS News. He's offered early dismissals at the end of the week on several occasions, one employee said.",
      "\"It's Almost FriYay,\" the email's subject line read, according to the staffers.",
      "Long was confirmed by the Senate in mid-June and took over the IRS after some tumult for the tax collection agency's leadership. The IRS has had several interim commissioners since Mr. Trump's return to office in January, including one who lasted for just 48 hours. The Trump administration has aimed to dramatically trim the agency's workforce.",
      "A former auctioneer and Missouri Republican congressman, Long was chosen to take over the IRS late last year after previously pushing to repeal much of the tax code during his time in the House. Long isn't an accountant by trade, but Mr. Trump touted his time as a tax adviser. After retiring from Congress in 2023, Long advised businesses on the Employee Retention Tax Credit, drawing criticism from Democrats who noted the credit's high rate of fraud.",
      "The IRS has been a focus of the Trump administration's government-wide staff cuts. The agency drew up plans earlier this year to cut its 102,000-person workforce by as much as 40% through a combination of layoffs and voluntary resignations, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The cuts were set to begin after April 15, which is the deadline for most Americans to file their taxes.",
      "As of May, some 25,000 staffers had left the IRS, a 25% decrease from February levels, according to a report by the IRS's internal watchdog, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration. Around 26% of the IRS's revenue agents \u2014 the staff who conduct audits \u2014 had left the agency by May, the report found.",
      "Meanwhile, staff from the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 a cost-cutting team once led by billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 sought access to the IRS's tax data system, sparking a lawsuit.",
      "Former IRS acting head Melanie Krause left the agency in April over a plan to share tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help identify undocumented immigrants. She was replaced by Gary Shapley, a longtime IRS agent who became well-known for speaking about alleged political influence in the Hunter Biden tax investigation. But Shapley was ousted after just two days following a dispute between Musk and Bessent.",
      "Bessent complained to Mr. Trump that Shapley had been installed at the urging of Musk and sought the president's approval to undo the decision, multiple sources told CBS News at the time.",

    "summary": "U.S. home prices are dropping the most in the South and West, according to a new report from Realtor.com.",
    "story": [
      "The housing market has been in a serious crunch since the COVID-19 pandemic, with limited inventory, elevated home prices and mortgages in the 7% range, continuing to keep many would-be home buyers\u00a0locked out. But even amid such tight constraints, modest declines in home prices can still be found in some regions of the country.",
      "That's according to a new report from Realtor.com, which measures changes in median home prices across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas since 2022, when median home prices hit a\u00a0peak of $443,000 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis.",
      "The extent to which home prices are declining varies from region to region according to the Realtor.com report, which is based on the brokerage platform's housing data.",
      "\"The housing market has cooled modestly in 2025,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a statement on the report. \"But the extent and persistence of rebalancing really varies across the country. And regionally, homebuyers and sellers are likely to experience a very different market.\"",
      "Behind those notable price differences is inventory. Right now, the housing market is essentially divided into two camps, with higher inventory in the South and West, where deeper price cuts can be found, and more limited inventory in the Midwest and Northeast, said Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"It's a supply and demand story,\" Krimmel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"When you have fewer homes for sale, and if there is still sufficient demand, that's going to maybe put upward pressure on prices or prevent them from falling.\"",
      "Cities where prices are falling",
      "The largest declines in median listing prices in 2025 tend to be concentrated in the South and West, where all 19 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas with median housing prices below July 2022 levels are located.",
      "\"After years of intense competition, it's starting to feel more balanced \u2014 especially in the South and West,\" Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage said in a statement on the Realtor.com report. \"It's not a buyer's market yet, but we're headed in that direction.\"",
      "The cities that saw the biggest declines in price were Austin, where median listing prices have fallen nearly 15% over the last three years; and Miami, where prices have dropped around 19%.",
      "According to Krimmel, inventory is rising in these markets as homes stay on the market longer and new listings climb.",
      "A boom in building also boosted housing supply in those regions during the COVID-19 pandemic, when demand for markets like Austin, Denver and Miami exploded, he added. Part of the reason construction in those cities took off, Krimmel added, was that the laws in their respective state make it easier to build during big influxes in demand.",
      "\"[Builders] we're actually able to get things permitted, get shovels in the ground and get buildings built,\" Krimmel said.",
      "Austin, Los Angeles and Miami saw the largest declines in median listing price over the past year, although prices in Los Angeles remain more than 18% above the median listing price in 2022.",
      "Cities where prices are rising",
      "Housing markets in cities in Northeast and Midwest remain squeezed due to \"sticky high\" prices and tight inventory, said Krimmel. Other contributing factors include stricter zoning and land use regulation laws that make building new houses more difficult, he said.",
      "In New York, for example, median listing prices have climbed roughly 16% since 2022, according to the report. Meanwhile, median listing prices in Milwaukee increased 26%.",
      "Furthermore, the number of active listings per month in the Northeast is still 50% below pre-pandemic levels, according to Krimmel. The number of active listings in the Midwest is down 40%, pointing to an inventory shortage in both regions, he said.",
      "While median listing prices have gone down over the last year in northeastern cities like Boston and Philadelphia, which saw 1.4% and 1.2% decreases, respectively, median prices remain at least 10% above those from 2022.",
      "\"To the extent that there are falling prices in the Northeast and the Midwest, for the most part it's pretty modest numbers,\" said Krimmel.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 15:53:24 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists caution new tariffs could pose economic risks, but the White House says growth is rebounding amid low inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Some economists are cautioning that President Trump's sweeping new tariffs on U.S. trade partners, which took effect Thursday, increase the risks that the U.S. economy could enter a period of stagflation.",
      "A mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation,\" the term describes periods marked by high prices and low GDP growth, such as the economic doldrums of the 1970s. To be sure, U.S. economic growth, though\u00a0slower so far this year than in 2024, remains relatively strong, and inflation remains far below its post-pandemic spike.",
      "But economists are flagging the potential for fresh tariffs, which\u00a0took effect Aug. 7,to fuel higher prices as businesses pass on the costs of the new import duties to consumers. With the latest round of import duties, the effective average tariff rate now stands at 18%, the highest since 1934, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Inflation likely rose 2.8% on an annual basis in July, inching higher from the 2.7% annual rate notched in the prior month, according to forecasts from economists polled by FactSet. July data for the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET on Aug. 12.",
      "\"The stagflation theme in markets is intensifying,\" Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok\u00a0wrote\u00a0in a research note Thursday.",
      "While prices likely crept higher last month, they're still nowhere near the post-pandemic price spike that financially hobbled many households. Yet an increase would represent a reversal of a downward trend earlier this year, and push the inflation rate farther from the Federal Reserve's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "The economy could face another hit from tariffs if some U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the import duties to the federal government, scale back hiring or expansion plans to cope with those higher costs, economists added. Last week's disappointing employment report suggested the U.S. job market is starting to wobble from the uncertainty of on-again, off-again tariffs, they noted.",
      "\"To offset internal costs, you may look at reducing your workforce and curbing wage growth to offset part of the cost of goods increase,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Greg Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "U.S. GDP is also forecast to slow throughout 2025, with economists polled by FactSet pegging this year's growth at 1.5%, down from 2.4% in 2024.",
      "The White House took issue with concerns raised by some economists about the potential for stagflation. \"Inflation continuing to remain cool and growth rebounding in Q2 both suggest stagflation is simply the latest buzzword for panican paranoia,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Panican\" is a term coined by Mr. Trump earlier this year to refer to the fears expressed by some critics about his tariffs.",
      "A challenging scenario",
      "The U.S. economy is facing a challenging scenario from the combination of a weaker job market and higher inflation, Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, a monetary policy research institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The U.S. economy appears to be hitting a mild form of stagflation,\" Amarnath said. \"I'd call it stagflation lite.\"",
      "The dangers of higher inflation and a weaker job market were highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell last month when he discussed the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. Powell pointed out that job creation has slowed, adding risks to the labor market, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% annual goal.",
      "The Fed has a dual goal of keeping both prices and unemployment low. Achieving those goals requires different strategies, however. Because high interest rates make it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, the Fed tends to hike rates to fight inflation.",
      "But when unemployment spikes, the Fed typically cuts its benchmark rate to make borrowing cheaper, which can encourage businesses to hire and expand.",
      "\"The economy is in good shape, but it's an unusual situation in that you have risks to both sides of the mandate,\" Powell said at a July 30 press conference.",
      "He added that the Fed is \"trying to do the right thing in what is a challenging situation because you're being pulled in two directions and you have to decide which of those it took to go in.\"",
      "With the job market now showing signs of stress, the challenge is whether the Fed should cut rates, or hold off because inflation remains higher than the central bank's goal \u2014 and is projected to inch higher, Slok noted.",
      "The manufacturing, retail, wholesale and construction industries, which are sensitive to the impact of tariffs, all notched fewer job gains than were initially reported, with the July jobs report's revisions. Manufacturing jobs declined for three consecutive months from May through July, the data shows.",
      "\"That's consistent with a level of uncertainty on the trade side depressing the willingness to hire,\" Amarnath said.",
      "At the same time, \"goods prices have picked up speed,\" he added. \"Household supplies and furniture, apparel and used cars are all starting to see upward momentum, and I think tariffs are an obvious reason for that.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Boar's Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year's deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.",
      "But recent inspections at Boar's Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.",
      "The Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \"failed to maintain sanitary conditions.\" Boar's Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.",
      "Inspectors at the time found\u00a0dozens of violations, including leftover meat on equipment, mold and mildew buildup, insects in and around deli meats, and puddles of blood on the plant's floor.",
      "USDA officials this week said they had \"thoroughly reviewed\" the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.",
      "\"The facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\" officials with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.",
      "Recent reports of similar sanitation issues",
      "And yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar's Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.",
      "In the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn't wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.",
      "The records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company's promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.",
      "\"If there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\" said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.",
      "Officials at Boar's Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.",
      "The company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump's nominee for USDA's undersecretary for food safety.",
      "Boar's Head last year said they \"regret and deeply apologize\" for the contamination and that \"comprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\"",
      "But company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination's cause.",
      "Brashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar's Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company's food safety board.",
      "\"Boar's Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\" described on the company's website, Boar's Head said in an emailed statement.",
      "\"We have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\" the statement said.",
      "The 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar's Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.",
      "The findings surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.",
      "\"You would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\" said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.",
      "Rep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \"appalling.\"",
      "\"This is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company's bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\" the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.",
      "The findings echo the \"inadequate sanitation practices\" that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.",
      "At the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.",
      "While no instances of insects were documented in this year's inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \"dried fat and protein from the previous day's production\" on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \"5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\"",
      "Other reports detailed beaded condensation \"directly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\" Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.",
      "The reports point to a \"food safety culture problem,\" said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.",
      "\"What jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\" she said. \"Usually that culture has to start at the top.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Aug 2025 12:28:22 -0400",
    "summary": "An EPA proposal seeks to revoke a key emissions finding which experts say would remove pressure on auto makers to produce EVs.",
    "story": [
      "A new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal\u00a0to revoke a landmark greenhouse gas finding could alter the direction of the auto industry, which until now has had to abide by strict emissions guidelines.",
      "The EPA on July 29\u00a0announced it is planning\u00a0to revoke an \"endangerment finding\" from 2009 that has served as the legal and scientific basis for the agency's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions across multiple industries, including motor vehicles, power plants, oil and gas producers and aircraft. The proposal, which still needs to go through a public comment period, focuses on regulations affecting the auto industry. If passed, it would repeal all greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines.",
      "\"With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for auto makers and American consumers,\" Lee Zeldin, the administrator of EPA, stated in the\u00a0announcement.",
      "Strict\u00a0standards for emissions and fuel efficiency introduced during the Obama administration and expanded during the Biden administration, which also provided\u00a0generous EV funding, has led many auto makers to add electric vehicles to their fleets in recent years. Others, like\u00a0Volvo, have taken things a step further and committed to a fully electric future. But the landscape is shifting under President Trump, who has pushed forward a deregulatory agenda.",
      "Experts say that if this proposal passes, it will ease pressure on auto makers to produce electric cars, enabling them to adapt their mix of EV and gas-powered vehicle offerings to meet consumer demand.",
      "\"It gives auto makers a little bit better ability to build, to produce and put vehicles on market that are more closely aligned with the pace of electric adoption right now,\" said Stephanie Brinley, a principal automotive analyst at S&P Global.",
      "John Bozzella, president and CEO Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents\u00a0most of the major car manufacturers in the U.S., said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch that the trade association is reviewing the announcement.",
      "\"At the same time,\" he added, \"there's no question the vehicle emissions regulations finalized under the previous administration aren't achievable and should be revised to reflect current market conditions, to keep the auto industry in America competitive, and to keep the industry on a path of vehicle choice and lower emissions.\"",
      "A spokesperson from the EPA said Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks and that the agency's proposal to revoke the endangerment finding \"does not prohibit vehicle manufacturers from developing EVs or different vehicles.\"",
      "Focus on consumer demand",
      "Experts say that even amid a shifting regulatory landscape, consumer preference will continue to drive auto makers' decisions.",
      "\"Their focus is going to be on making vehicles more affordable and dealing with the fact that consumers, not the government, are standing in the way of the mass adoption for EVs,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group.",
      "The rate of electric vehicle adoption has been steady over the last several years, although the majority of Americans still fuel their cars at the pump. Demand for the vehicles has waned over the last year, according to data on light vehicle registration from S&P Global Mobility. From January to May, the electric vehicle market share was 7.3%, compared with 8% for the entire year of 2024, data from the auto intelligence provider shows.",
      "But while consumer demand may have stalled slightly over the past year, auto makers will still want to offer low-emissions products in order to stay competitive both at home and abroad, Ivan Drury, director of insights at online car marketplace Edmunds, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Every auto maker is a global competitor, and even though they might not be selling as well here, they could sell elsewhere better,\" he said.",
      "Impact would take time",
      "Experts say the proposal, if passed, wouldn't drastically change any near-term plans of auto makers, given the time and money they have already invested in their product lines.",
      "\"If had already planned to build X number of this kind of vehicle, you can change that, but not necessarily tomorrow,\" said Brinley. \"So that's gonna have to be planned out.\"",
      "Product development cycles at car manufacturers span five to 10 years, according to a report from Eurasia Group, a global research firm.",
      "The exact strategy and speed with which companies make changes would vary from auto maker to auto maker, according to experts. \"For now, auto makers would enjoy the flexibility and lower costs from less stringent emissions limits, particularly in their nonelectric fleet planning,\" the report from Eurasia says.",
      "There are concerns among some companies that the EPA's proposal, if passed, would inject a degree of chaos into industry, David Victor, a professor at University of California San Diego, told CBS MoneyWatch. Also, the rule-making process will likely be challenged in the courts, he said.",
      "\"[Auto makers] will not get a reliable new set of rules anytime soon,\" said Victor.",
      "The EPA is\u00a0holding\u00a0a virtual public hearing on the proposed rule on Aug. 19-20, with a public comment period open through Sept. 15.",

      "Asked about how the technology might impact the livelihood of human programmers, Altman said he thought the technology would actually create more job opportunities for as demand for software rises.",

      "The Camaro sports car retails for between $32,495 and can rise to around $50,000, depending on the finishings, transmission type and other options a buyer selects.",
      "To determine the most commonly swiped vehicles, the HLDI analyzed stolen vehicle data for 2022-2024 car models between the years of 2021 to 2024. Their analysis hit upon a few shared traits between many of the cars favored by auto thieves.",
      "\"What all vehicles in top 20 have in common is that they are relatively expensive, relatively powerful and in many cases they are pickup trucks,\" Matt Moore, chief insurance operations officer at HLDI, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Muscle cars are attractive to thieves because they are looking for vehicles with high horsepower, the group said.",
      "The Camaro models have another feature that make them vulnerable: on-board ports that contain vehicle data, such as fuel emissions and performance stats, but can also serve as a point of entry for thieves.",
      "\"In the case of Camaro ZL1, it is very desirable to thieves, and, on top of it, there's a vulnerability that makes them relatively easy to steal,\" Moore said.",
      "\"Due to the vulnerability, with the right knowledge and right bits of technology, someone who can gain access to the inside of one of these Camaros can steal it relatively easily,\" Moore said, noting that he didn't want to describe the process more precisely so as not to encourage thieves.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Aug 2025 20:21:59 -0400",
    "summary": "Profit hits and price hikes are already coming down the pike as a result of new U.S. tariffs, according to economists.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which\u00a0went into effect on Thursday, are likely to have a negative effect on companies' bottom lines and cause consumer prices to rise, trade experts say.",
      "With the new duties on imports from dozens of U.S. trade partners now in place, Mr. Trump's foreign trade policy is expected to lead to even more dramatic cost increases for American companies and consumers, according to economists.",
      "\"Even if they might not raise prices immediately, it's unlikely that most businesses are just going to be willing to eat the extra costs forever,\" Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, an online lending marketplace, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The impact of tariffs on consumer prices was initially muted, explained Shulz, as firms can be reluctant to be the first among their competitors to institute price hikes. While some companies waited to see where tariff rates settled before adjusting retail prices, others took steps to absorb added costs to avoid turning off customers. But companies can't employ such measures forever, according to experts.",
      "\"You don't want to be the first to raise prices, even if you have a perfectly legitimate reason for doing so,\" Schulz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So, I suspect once we see businesses start raising their prices more, that might embolden others to do so as well.\"",
      "That could mean a tsunami of price hike announcements from corporations, some of which have already warned of tariff impacts, or instituted \"tariff surcharges\" to cover their added costs.",
      "To date, Mr. Trump's tariffs on the U.S.'s trade partners have generated billions of dollars in revenue for the U.S. Specifically, the U.S. government collected about $30 billion in tariff revenue in July, according to the Treasury Department. That reflects a 242% jump in revenue collected from duties since July 2024.",
      "In addition to paying down the national debt, which currently stands at\u00a0more than $36 trillion, those billions in new tariff revenue may be used to issue\u00a0rebate checks for Americans, Mr. Trump suggested last month.",
      "Profit dips",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "\"There is very little evidence that foreign exporters to the U.S. are reducing their prices,\" Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're not seeing broad-based evidence of price cuts by countries, and that's an indication that foreign exporters realize that it's U.S. importers, U.S. businesses and eventually consumers that are bearing the brunt of this tariff-induced inflation acceleration.\"",
      "Companies from personal electronics companies to automakers have already experienced the damaging effects of Mr. Trump's foreign trade policies on profits.",
      "On Thursday Toyota, the world's largest auto maker, reported a 37% drop in profit in the April-June quarter and said it cut its full-year earnings forecast largely because of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Other auto makers have also said they expect to see profit drops as a result of the new levies.",
      "GM has projected a tariff hit of up to $5 billion for 2025, and Ford has said tariffs will cost the company $3 billion in revenue for the year.",
      "Liquor companies are in the tariff crosshairs, too. Guinness maker Diageo said it expects tariffs to cost it $200 million a year.",
      "Walmart in May warned that higher tariffs would force it to increase prices on a wide range of items at its stores, from bananas to children's car seats.",
      "Price hikes",
      "Some companies have said outright that in order to bear the added costs from the new tariffs they'll have to pass along some of the pain to consumers in the form of price hikes.",
      "For example, popular consumer electronics marker Sonos, which makes speakers, said on its third-quarter earnings call Wednesday that it would raise prices on its audio devices as a result of\u00a0higher reciprocal tariffs on Vietnam and Malaysia, where Sonos devices for the U.S. market are made.",
      "Overall, as a result of the levies, Americans are expected to pay an average of 18.3% more for imported products,\u00a0according to the Budget Lab at Yale, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "EY-Parthenon's Daco told CBS MoneyWatch that the higher costs being paid by companies because of tariffs is already starting to trickle down to product prices.",
      "Currently, the average tariff rate stands at around 18% \u2014 the highest it's been in decades, according to Daco. As a result, \"the increase in the tariffs will only exacerbate inflationary pressure that [is] starting to emerge,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"You're going to see more durable goods, and nondurable goods products with higher price tags,\" he said. \"That will feed into higher consumer price inflation and lead to a more pronounced erosion of consumer spending as more households struggle in the face of these higher prices.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing.

    "summary": "Under a new executive order signed by President Trump, workers could add higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies to their 401(k)s.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that could allow millions of Americans saving for retirement through 401(k) accounts to invest in higher-risk private equity and cryptocurrency assets.",
      "The executive order doesn't immediately change how people will invest for retirement through their employer-sponsored accounts, as federal agencies would need to rewrite regulations to allow expanded investment choices. That's a process that experts say could take months, or longer, to complete.",
      "But once done, employers could offer a broader array of mutual funds and investments to workers, according to the White House. New plans could invest in alternative assets, particularly private equity, cryptocurrencies and real estate.",
      "The move comes as the 401(k) has become the primary vehicle for American workers to save for retirement, with most employers offering a menu of investment choices among major asset classes, such as stock-based mutual funds. The $5 trillion private equity industry, which makes investments into private businesses rather than publicly traded stocks, has for decades wanted to compete for a role in retirement plans.",
      "At the same time, the cryptocurrency industry, whose executives strongly supported Trump's 2024 campaign, has aimed for more mainstream acceptance among Americans.",
      "\"It was inevitable that bitcoin would make its way into American 401(k)'s,\" said Cory Klippsten, the CEO of Swan Bitcoin. \"As fiduciaries realize bitcoin's risk-adjusted upside over the long term, we'll see growing allocations, especially from younger, tech-savvy workers who want hard money, not melting ice cubes.\"",
      "The EO could give private equity and crypto firms long-sought access to a pool of funds worth trillions.",
      "Investment companies applauded Mr. Trump's executive order, with TIAA, which manages the retirement assets of teachers, professors and other academics, and investing giant BlackRock saying they support the measure for providing a broader number of investment strategies to workers.",
      "\"We believe end investors can benefit from the advantages that private investments can offer when embedded within professionally managed vehicles like target date funds or through guaranteed annuity products,\" TIAA said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Changing the 401(k) rules",
      "The president's order directs the Labor Department and other agencies to redefine what would be considered a qualified asset under 401(k) retirement rules.",
      "Americans' retirement plans are governed by a law known as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, better known as ERISA. Employers are required by law to offer retirement options that are in the best interest of their employees, not Wall Street.",
      "Most retirement plans for Americans are made up of stock and bond investments, and to a much lesser extent, cash and heavily traded commodities such as gold.",
      "Even after the regulations are written, it will take time for the major retirement plan companies such as Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and others, to develop appropriate funds for employers to use. Employers are not likely to revise their retirement plan options quickly as well, so it may take several years before crypto and private equity investments are mainstream in an individual's retirement plan.",
      "The price of bitcoin was up 2% on Thursday to $116,542 and has nearly doubled since Trump was elected.",
      "Under Democratic President Joe Biden, federal regulators were to treat cryptocurrency investments with \"extreme care\" because of the extreme volatility of crypto. It is not uncommon for bitcoin, ethereum and other big cryptocurrencies to move up or down 10% in a single day, whereas a 2% or 3% single-day move in the stock market would be considered historic.",
      "For cryptocurrency companies, which donated millions to Trump's campaign as well as his inauguration, one goal was to get their industry qualified under ERISA. Coinbase, one of the largest crypto companies in the United States, was also a major donor toward Trump's military parade in Washington this summer. Under Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, where the Biden administration said crypto should be treated as a security.",
      "Crypto investors",
      "Crypto is particularly popular among young Americans. While volatile, bitcoin has generally moved upward since it was created by an anonymous programmer nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Private equity firms rely heavily on high-net-worth individuals and state and private pension plans, which have extremely long investment timelines. But having access to Americans' retirement assets would open up a deep pool of cash.",
      "Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman has told investors going back to at least 2017 that it was a \"dream\" of his and the industry to be able to draw upon these retirement assets.",
      "Previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike, had agreed that private equity investments, which can be riskier, more expensive and less liquid than traditional stock and bond market mutual funds, should not be included in 401(k) plans.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump officially began levying higher import taxes on dozens of countries Thursday, just as the economic fallout of his months-long tariffs threats was beginning to create visible damage to the U.S. economy.",
      "The White House said that starting just after midnight EDT, goods from more than 60 countries and the European Union began facing tariff rates of 10% or higher. Products from the European Union, Japan and South Korea are being taxed at 15%, while imports from Taiwan, Vietnam and Bangladesh are being taxed at 20%. Mr. Trump also expects places such as the EU, Japan and South Korea to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S.",
      "He immediately took to his Truth Social platform to hail the levies, saying, \"IT'S MIDNIGHT!!! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TARIFFS ARE NOW FLOWING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\"",
      "About an hour before that, he posted, \"RECIPROCAL TARIFFS TAKE EFFECT AT MIDNIGHT TONIGHT! BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA. THE ONLY THING THAT CAN STOP AMERICA'S GREATNESS WOULD BE A RADICAL LEFT COURT THAT WANTS TO SEE OUR COUNTRY FAIL!\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said, \"I think the growth is going to be unprecedented,\" adding that the U.S. was \"taking in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs.\" But he said he couldn't provide a specific figure for revenues because \"we don't even know what the final number is\" regarding tariff rates. \n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, the Trump White House is confident that the onset of his broad tariffs will provide clarity about the path of the world's largest economy. Now that companies understand the direction the U.S. is headed, the administration believes it can ramp up new investments and jump-start hiring in ways that can rebalance the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power.  \n\r\nBut so far, there are signs of self-inflicted wounds to America as companies and consumers alike brace for the impact of new taxes. What the data has shown is a U.S. economy that changed in April with the president's initial rollout of tariffs, an event that led to market drama, a negotiating period and Mr. Trump's ultimate decision to start his universal tariffs on Thursday.",
      "After April, economic reports showed that hiring began to stall, inflationary pressures crept upward and home values in key markets started to decline, said John Silvia, CEO of Dynamic Economic Strategy. \n\r\n\"A less productive economy requires fewer workers,\" Silvia said in an analysis note. \"But there is more, the higher tariff prices lower workers' real wages. The economy has become less productive, and firms cannot pay the same real wages as before. Actions have consequences.\" \n\r\nEven then, the ultimate transformations of the tariffs are unknown and could play out over months, if not years. Many economists say the risk is that the American economy is steadily eroded rather than collapsing instantly. \n\r\n\"We all want it to be made for television where it's this explosion - it's not like that,\" said Brad Jensen, a professor at Georgetown University. \"It's going to be fine sand in the gears and slow things down.\" \n\r\nMr. Trump has promoted the tariffs as a way to reduce the persistent trade deficit. But importers sought to avoid the taxes by importing more goods before the taxes went into effect. As a result, the $582.7 billion trade imbalance for the first half of the year was 38% higher than in 2024. Total construction spending has dropped 2.9% over the past year, and the factory jobs promised by Mr. Trump have so far actually been job losses. \n\r\nThe lead-up to Thursday fit the slapdash nature of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which have been variously rolled out, walked back, delayed, increased, imposed by letter and frantically renegotiated. \n\r\nThe process has been so muddled that officials for key trade partners were unclear at the start of the week whether the tariffs would begin Thursday or Friday. The language of the July 31 order to delay the start of tariffs from Aug. 1 said the higher tax rates would start in seven days. \n\r\nOn Wednesday morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, was asked if the new tariffs began at midnight Thursday, and he said reporters should check with the U.S. Trade Representative's Office. \n\r\nMr. Trump announced additional 25% tariffs to be imposed on India\u00a0Wednesday because it buys Russian oil, bringing India's total import taxes to 50%. India's Foreign Ministry called the new duties \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable.\"",
      "Swiss officials planned an \"extraordinary\" meeting Thursday after a delegation returned from Washington following an attempt to head off a 39% tariff on Swiss products, the government said in an X post. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter left Washington empty-handed Wednesday, a source told the Reuters news service, which cited the source as saying her proposal for a 10% tariff rate was rejected.",
      "Mr. Trump has said import taxes are still coming on pharmaceutical drugs and announced 100% tariffs on computer chips, meaning the U.S. economy could remain in a place of suspended animation as it awaits the impacts. \n\r\nThe president's use of a 1977 law to declare an economic emergency to impose the tariffs is also being challenged. The impending ruling from last week's hearing before a U.S. appeals court could cause Mr. Trump to find other legal justifications if judges say he exceeded his authority. \n\r\nEven people who worked with Mr. Trump during his first term are skeptical that things will go smoothly for the economy, such as Paul Ryan, the former Republican House speaker, who has emerged as a Trump critic. \n\r\n\"There's no sort of rationale for this other than the president wanting to raise tariffs based upon his whims, his opinions,\" Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday. \"I think choppy waters are ahead because I think they're going to have some legal challenges.\" \n\r\nStill, the stock market has been solid during the recent tariff drama, with the S&P 500 index climbing more than 25% from its April low. The market's rebound and the income tax cuts in Mr. Trump's tax and spending measures signed into law on July 4 have given the White House confidence that economic growth is bound to accelerate in the coming months. \n\r\nAs of now, the president says he still foresees an economic boom while the rest of the world and American voters wait nervously. \n\r\n\"There's one person who can afford to be cavalier about the uncertainty that he's creating, and that's Donald Trump,\" said Rachel West, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation who worked in the Biden White House on labor policy. \"The rest of Americans are already paying the price for that uncertainty.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday, after he fired the former commissioner earlier this month, blaming her for a weaker-than-expected jobs report.",
      "Antoni is a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, and he holds a doctorate in economics from Northern Illinois University. He has criticized the BLS in the past for low response rates and questioned the agency's methodology, calling its health insurance figures \"phoney baloney\" last year and at one point joking that \"the 'L' is silent\" in BLS' name.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0X post.",
      "\"There are better ways to collect, process, and disseminate data\u2014that is the task for the next BLS commissioner, and only consistent delivery of accurate data in a timely manner will rebuild the trust that has been lost over the last several years,\" he wrote shortly after Mr. Trump fired the former BLS chief.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Antoni in a Truth Social post, saying he \"will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "Antoni will need to be confirmed by the Senate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics is currently led by acting Commissioner William Watrowski, who has worked at the agency for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump ordered his administration to terminate Erika McEntarfer, who had been commissioner of labor statistics, on Aug. 1, hours after the release of the July jobs report data. That report showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, along with a steep downward revision to May and June's hiring numbers.",
      "Hours before her firing, Antoni criticized BLS for \"data problems\" and a trend of \"highly problematic\" revisions, though he also touted some figures in the July jobs report, including a jump in employment by native-born Americans and a slowdown in government jobs.",
      "In the wake of McEntarfer's firing, influential ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon backed Antoni to take over the BLS. Antoni appeared on Bannon's show \"War Room\" on the day the jobs report came out, calling McEntarfer \"incompetent.\" Days later, Bannon said \"we're pushing\" for Antoni to lead the BLS, and called him \"the guy that almost single-handedly took it down by going through their numbers.\"",
      "Announcing McEntarfer's firing in a post on Truth Social, the president claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that she had \"faked the Jobs Numbers before the Election to try and boost Kamala's chances of Victory\" and pledged to replace her \"with someone much more competent and qualified.\"",
      "The jobs report for October 2024, which was released on Nov. 1, 2024, four days before Election Day, showed just 12,000 jobs were created \u2014 far short of the 100,000 forecast for the month \u2014 following two hurricanes and a major labor dispute. The following month, that figure was revised upward, to 36,000. September's jobs report, however, dramatically exceeded forecasts \u2014 254,000 jobs were created, rather than the 140,000 economic analysts had expected. That figure was later revised down to 223,000.",
      "Mr. Trump continued railing against the ousted commissioner and the BLS more broadly in the days after he fired her, claiming in a post on Truth Social last week that the July jobs report had been \"RIGGED,\" though he provided no evidence to support it. The president said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Tuesday that it's a \"highly political situation.\" And National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the president's decision in an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" citing a series of revisions and patterns that \"could make people wonder.\"",
      "\"What we need is a fresh set of eyes over at the BLS,\" Hassett said, adding that \"the president wants his own people there so that when we see the numbers they're more transparent and more reliable.\"",
      "McEntarfer had been commissioner for a little over a year and a half, after she was confirmed in a broad bipartisan vote of 86 to 8 by the Senate in January 2024.",
      "The latest jobs report showed employers in July adding a weaker-than-expected 73,000 jobs, with a downward revision of 258,000 fewer jobs created in May and June. Mr. Trump, who often touts the job numbers, called the jobs figures a \"shock\" and the revision a \"major mistake.\" The BLS said in its report that monthly revisions \"result from additional reports received from businesses and government agencies since the last published estimates and from the recalculation of seasonal factors.\"",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer acknowledged in an interview for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"there are always revisions,\" but he added that \"sometimes you see these revisions go in really extreme ways.\"",
      "\"The president is the president. He can choose who works in the executive branch,\" Greer said.",
      "Meanwhile, some economists and lawmakers have expressed concern over the firing, and a group of former BLS leaders warned that the move \"undermines the valuable work and dedication of BLS staff\" and \"escalates the President's unprecedented attacks on the independence and integrity of the federal statistical system.\" The group called on Congress to investigate the firing.",

    "summary": "President Trump has extended a temporary truce in the U.S.-China trade war, preventing tariffs on China from leaping to at least 80%.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying a set of sky-high tariffs on Chinese goods for at least 90 days, extending a ceasefire in the U.S.-China trade war, the White House announced.",
      "The president's order will keep tariffs at 30% \u2014 the level that was set in mid-May, when both countries agreed to temporarily back off a set of tit-for-tat tariffs that exceeded 100%. That agreement was set to expire Tuesday, and without an extension, levies on some Chinese goods could have leaped to at least 80%, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.",
      "The order says the U.S.'s \"reciprocal\" tariff on Chinese goods will remain at 10% until at least Nov. 10. An additional 20% tariff on China that was imposed earlier this year due to fentanyl trafficking is\u00a0also still in place, bringing the total rate to 30%.",
      "\"The United States and China have engaged in multiple rounds of productive negotiations to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns,\" the White House said in a fact sheet announcing the extension.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that China and the U.S. were \"likely\" to agree to a 90-day extension as the two countries seek to negotiate a longer-term trade deal. Mr. Trump told reporters earlier Monday those negotiations were going \"quite nicely.\" Representatives from both sides met in Stockholm late last month.",
      "Greer told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" earlier this month that \"I don't think anyone wants to see\" high tariffs on China snap back.",
      "\"We're working on some technical issues, and we're talking to the president about it,\" Greer said. \"I think it's going in a positive direction.\"",
      "A return to high tariffs could have caused U.S. imports of Chinese goods to plummet, disrupting trade between the world's two largest economies. In mid-April, when tariffs on Chinese imports still stood at 145%, the Trump administration planned for possible supply chain disruptions.",
      "China was the U.S.'s third-largest trading partner last year, not counting the European Union. The U.S. imported $438.9 billion in Chinese goods and China imported $143.5 billion in American goods, according to U.S. government data.",
      "Mr. Trump first hit China with 34% tariffs in early April, one of dozens of countries to face hefty \"reciprocal\" levies. The president argues tariffs could boost U.S. manufacturers and correct what he views as unfair trade practices, but many economists warn Mr. Trump's trade strategy could lead to higher consumer prices and more sluggish economic growth.",
      "The president quickly paused his April tariffs for most countries, and reinstated them, often at substantially lower levels, last week. But the China levies remained in place for more than a month and drew retaliation from Beijing, ultimately pushing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% and Chinese tariffs on American goods to 125%.",
      "The two countries agreed to ease the tariffs for at least 90 days in May, buying more time for Mr. Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping's teams to negotiate a trade deal. Since then, the U.S. has charged 30% tariffs and China has charged 10%.",
      "The talks have occasionally proven contentious. Earlier this year, the two countries feuded over Beijing's restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductors and the Trump administration's crackdown on international students from China. Mr. Trump accused China of violating the terms of the May truce \u2014 though both countries reached a deal to ease some of those tensions in June. And on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed China to quadruple its imports of U.S. soybeans.",

      "Mr. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was especially dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace.",
      "He said the Ukrainian president had been to \"a lot of meetings\" without managing to halt a war that Russia started. Mr. Trump also noted that Zelenskyy had been in power for the duration of the war and said \"nothing happened\" during that time. He contrasted that with Putin, who has wielded power in Russia for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump said that, after his meeting with Putin, \"The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin\" but it could also be a meeting with \"Putin and Zelenskyy and me.\"",
      "European allies have pushed for Ukraine's involvement, fearful that discussions could otherwise favor Moscow.",
      "To that point, Mr. Trump said he would call Zelenskyy and European leaders after his discussion with Putin to \"tell them what kind of a deal \u2014 I'm not going to make a deal. It's not up to me to make a deal.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spent the early part of his administration decrying Zelenskyy, even suggesting he was a dictator because his country has not held elections during the war. Zelenskyy was hounded out of the Oval Office in February after Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance suggested he hadn't been grateful enough for U.S. support.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump has expressed frustration with Putin that Russia hasn't appeared to take a push for a ceasefire more seriously, and softened his tone toward Zelenskyy. His comments Monday suggested he might have had another change of heart.",
      "\"President Putin invited me to get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he thought it was \"very respectful\" that Putin is coming to the U.S. for Friday's meeting, instead of insisting that Mr. Trump go to Russia.",
      "\"I'd like to see a ceasefire. I'd like to see the best deal that can be made for both parties,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president repeated that any major agreement could involve land swaps, without elaborating. He had threatened Moscow with more economic sanctions if more isn't done to work toward a ceasefire, but suggested Monday that, should Friday's meeting be successful, he could see a day when the U.S. and Russia normalize trade relations.",
      "Putin is expected to be unwavering in his demands to keep all the territory his forces now occupy and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term aim of returning it to Moscow's sphere of influence.",
      "Zelenskyy insists he will never consent to any formal Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory or give up a bid for NATO membership.",
      "Putin believes he has the advantage on the ground as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russian advances along the 600-mile front. On the front lines, few Ukrainian soldiers believe there's an end in sight to the war.",
      "With the Europeans and Ukrainians so far not invited to the summit, Germany sought to prepare by inviting Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy, the NATO chief and several other European leaders for a virtual meeting on Wednesday.",
      "The German chancellery said the talks would seek additional ways to pressure Russia and prepare for peace negotiations and \"related issues of territorial claims and security.\"",
      "Steffen Meyer, spokesperson for German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, said the German government \"has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force\" and that Ukraine should decide its own fate \"independently and autonomously.\"",
      "Earlier, a Ukrainian drone attack killed one person and wounded two others in a region some 260 miles east of Moscow.",
      "Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed a total of 39 Ukrainian drones overnight and Monday morning over several Russian regions as well as over the Crimean Peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.",

    "summary": "President Trump said that he is deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and that the federal government has taken control of the D.C. police.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday that he is deploying members of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and that the federal government has taken control of the D.C. police as part of a push to crack down on crime in the nation's capital, despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "\"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" Mr. Trump said at a news conference at the White House. \"This is liberation day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back.\"",
      "Flanked by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and FBI Director Kash Patel, Mr. Trump said he was officially enforcing Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 and placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department \"under direct federal control.\" He said Bondi was taking control of the department immediately under a public safety emergency. A White House official later said the arrangement is expected to last 30 days, the maximum amount of time allowed under the law without action from Congress.",
      "\"In addition, I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later that about 800 guardsmen would be called up.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" In an accompanying executive order, Mr. Trump wrote that the deployment \"shall remain in effect until I determine that conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "Violent crime in D.C. has been declining for the last year and a half after spiking in 2023, according to local police data. So far this year, robberies have dropped by 28% and overall violent crime is down 26%, as of Aug. 11. Last year, violent crime in the capital city hit its lowest level in more than 30 years, the Justice Department said.",
      "The president criticized what he called \"phony numbers\" on crime in D.C., saying the administration would \"look into that.\" And he said the crime issue \"directly impacts the functioning of the federal government and is a threat to America, really.\"",
      "\"We have other cities also that are bad. Very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're not going to lose our cities over this.\"",
      "The president said the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and \"we're going to clean it up real quick.\"",
      "\"It's becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness,\" the president added. He called it \"embarrassing\" for him to be \"up here talking about how unsafe and dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was,\" ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.",
      "The president cited a number of high-profile crimes, including the alleged assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer last week, who the president said was \"savagely beaten by a band of roving thugs after defending a young woman from an attempted carjacking.\" Shortly after the incident, the White House announced that it had boosted the presence of federal law enforcement in the district, as Mr. Trump threatened a federal takeover of the city.",
      "Mr. Trump said a process had begun over the weekend to remove homeless encampments in the district. He noted that the Metropolitan Police Department and federal authorities would be supported by the 800 D.C. National Guardsmen and potentially \"much more.\"",
      "\"If necessary, we're going to move servicemembers directly to joining the guardsmen,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In an executive order declaring a crime emergency in the district, the president determined that \"special conditions of an emergency nature exist\" that require the use of the MPD for federal purposes, including maintaining law and order, protecting federal buildings, monuments and other federal property and ensuring the \"conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government.\" The executive order directs the D.C. mayor to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.\"",
      "The law allows the president to require the D.C. mayor to provide \"such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\" for a period of 48 hours, a deadline that can be extended by notifying Congress about the takeover and how much longer it is likely to continue. A House Oversight Committee spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that the panel had been notified by the president of the extension beyond 48 hours. The statute says the president can control the police department for up to 30 days, \"unless the Senate and the House of Representatives enact into law a joint resolution authorizing such an extension.\"",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said that \"we will follow the law\" and comply with the president's order. She said she hopes to meet with Bondi soon, and noted that the D.C. police chief remains in operational control of the MPD.",
      "\"While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised,\" Bowser said at a news conference later in the day. \"I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\"",
      "The moves come after the administration deployed about 450 federal law enforcement officers from a number of agencies across D.C. overnight Sunday. The president pledged in a social media post Sunday that he would \"make our Capital safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.\"",
      "\"The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong. It's all going to happen very fast, just like the Border.\"",
      "The president previously deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles amid heated protests over immigration raids in June. Mr. Trump also deployed the National Guard in June 2020 to D.C. to quell protests after the death of George Floyd.",
      "In March, Mr. Trump signed an executive order establishing a \"D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force.\" He has said violent crime must be stopped in the district, claiming that it \"has become one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.\"",
      "Bowser pushed back on the characterization of crime in the district, noting on Monday that violent crime is down following a well-documented spike in violence in 2023 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We have been able to reverse that 2023 crime spike. This year, crime isn't just down from 2023. It's also down from 2019, before the pandemic, and we're at a 30-year violent crime low,\" she said. \"We're not satisfied. We haven't taken our foot off the gas. And we continue to look for ways to make our cities safer.\"",
      "The mayor told MSNBC on Sunday that she has talked with Mr. Trump \"repeatedly\" about crime and that \"the president is very aware of our efforts.\" Bowser acknowledged that \"the D.C. National Guard is the president's National Guard, so that's always his prerogative.\" And she noted that \"federal law enforcement is always on the street in D.C. and we always work cooperatively with them.\"",
      "In another post later Sunday, the president said Bowser \"is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive.\"",
      "Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents the district in a nonvoting seat in the House, said Mr. Trump's move to federalize D.C. police is a \"historic assault on D.C. home rule,\" calling it a \"counterproductive, escalatory seizure of D.C.'s resources to use for purposes not supported by D.C. residents.\"",
      "Aaron  Navarro and \n                                                  \n                                  Weijia  Jiang\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Education Secretary Linda McMahon is touring the country to promote state-led education plans.",
    "story": [
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon is kicking off a nationwide tour focused on promoting the administration's goal of dismantling the Department of Education, which has been met with congressional and legal challenges.",
      "The \"Returning Education to the States Tour\" is set to take McMahon on a tour of all 50 states, starting in Louisiana, where she met with leadership and educators to discuss strategies for improving education. She told \"CBS Mornings Plus\" that this approach is meant to focus on highlighting resources states can provide to students, in lieu of those traditionally provided by the Department of Education.",
      "\"I think as we make this tour and as I see what best practices are and we provide these toolkits, we develop them and then can deliver them to the states and say these are things that you can choose from. These are things that have been successful in other states. It's not a mandate,\" McMahon said. \"I think every school system needs to work within its own community to decide what curriculum works best there. What are the ways that their students can learn? And that's why it's imperative that education be returned to the states because when states are creative and innovative, you will see the kind of progress that you've seen here in Louisiana.\"",
      "President Trump issued an executive order to begin dismantling the department in March, arguing that education policy and funding should be left to the states. McMahon announced cuts of roughly half its workforce the same month. The downsizing has led to legal challenges, but the Supreme Court allowed the cuts to continue in July.",
      "In 2024, the department accounted for less than 4% of the federal budget. Its responsibilities include overseeing federal student loan programs, distributing grants for low-income schools and enforcing non-discrimination policies in schools. It does not set curriculum.",
      "Completely abolishing the department would require congressional approval, an unlikely proposition given Democrats' general opposition to eliminating it altogether. Democrats say shuttering the department would lead to chaos for students and families who rely on federal funding for a patchwork of education programs.",
      "In her tour, the secretary is highlighting Louisiana because it is the only state in the country that has shown an improvement in elementary literacy since before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a review of fourth graders' standardized testing scores by The Nation's Report Card. The review shows that since 2019, Louisiana has gone from being ranked last in the nation for fourth-grade reading scores to 16th. Massachusetts currently holds the top spot, despite seeing declining scores during that same time period.",
      "During that time, Louisiana also received more than $5 billion for education-related COVID-19 pandemic relief assistance, according to data from the Department of Education. That funding has been used to fund a variety of educational programs, including additional teacher trainings and outreach efforts for students who are struggling academically.",
      "Louisiana State Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley said his state's use of those funds illustrates why he is in support of the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the Department of Education.",
      "\"We were able to use those pandemic dollars around the academic efforts that we knew were best for students in the state of Louisiana and that really worked,\" Brumley said. \"I think that if we can continue to work with Secretary McMahon and her team around loosening the restrictions around these funds, we can work with our state legislature, with moms and dads and local communities here around where to best situate those dollars for the needs of kids here in the state of Louisiana.\"",
      "McMahon was also quick to brush aside concerns about funding for special education programs suffering if the Department of Education is dismantled.",
      "\"I think that is the least worry that anyone should have because Congress appropriates that money and it flows through whichever agency will be distributing it. So that money flowed from 1965 before there was a Department of Education, and it will continue to flow,' McMahon said.",
      "It's unclear which agency would become responsible for distributing special education grants if the Department of Education is disbanded. Currently, the department provides special education grants that supplement state funding for the more than 7.5 million students with disabilities.",

    "summary": "A federal judge on Monday denied a request from the Trump administration to unseal grand jury material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday denied a request from the Trump administration to unseal grand jury material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime associate of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, saying there is nothing in the grand jury record that would shed new light on the case.",
      "Judge Paul Engelmayer of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected the Justice Department's bid to unveil the material in a 31-page order Monday morning. In court filings, Justice Department lawyers argued the circumstances of the Maxwell case warranted the release of the grand jury transcripts and exhibits, which typically remain secret. Engelmayer rejected that argument.",
      "\"The Government's invocation of special circumstances, however, fails at the threshold,\" Engelmayer wrote. \"Its entire premise \u2014 that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them \u2014 is demonstrably false.\"",
      "\"The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor,\" Engelmayer said. \"They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's. They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes. They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein's death. They do not reveal the path of the Government's investigation.\"",
      "He said anyone \"who reviewed these materials expecting, based on the Government's representations, to learn new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes and the investigation into them, would come away feeling disappointed and misled. There is no 'there' there.\"",
      "In July, the Justice Department asked the judges overseeing the Maxwell and Epstein cases to release the grand jury material that formed the basis for the federal charges against them, a move that came amid uproar over the department's review of the so-called \"Epstein files\" and decision not to release additional documents in the government's possession. The basis for the Justice Department's request was, as Engelmayer noted, that the grand jury documents \"contain significant, undisclosed information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the investigation into them.\"",
      "But he pointed out that these grand juries had not been used for any investigative purpose, but rather had only been convened to return an indictment. He said no victim, eyewitness or suspect testified. Each of the two grand juries \"received evidence on a single day,\" hearing only from a single person, a summary witness who \"testified to information obtained in the Government's investigation to support the charges in the proposed indictment.\"",
      "Englemayer suggested that if the case were unsealed, a \"member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion \u2014 aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Maxwell's legal team for comment. Maxwell is continuing to contest her 2021 conviction.",
      "Her attorneys argued against the Justice Department's attempt to unseal the testimony and exhibits, writing that their client had \"no choice but to respectfully oppose\" the release.",
      "In numerous court filings leading up to Engelmayer's decision, the Justice Department acknowledged that the grand jury transcripts, containing testimony from only two law enforcement officials, were mostly already made public during Epstein and Maxwell's court proceedings.",
      "Engelmayer wrote that after a court review of the grand jury material, he found the release would \"not reveal new information of any consequence.\"",
      "\"They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's. They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes,\" Engelmayer wrote. \"They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein's death. They do not reveal the path of the Government's investigation.\"",
      "\"Insofar as the motion to unseal implies that the grand jury materials are an untapped mine lode of undisclosed information about Epstein or Maxwell or confederates, they definitively are not that,\" Engelmayer continued, criticizing the Trump administration's justification for unsealing the documents as \"disingenuous.\"",
      "\"A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion \u2014 aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,\" he wrote.",

    "summary": "A program that pays court-appointed private lawyers is facing a financial crisis, since it ran out of money in early July.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Just over a year ago, federal judges, defenders and a group of lawyers who represent criminal indigent defendants gathered at the U.S. courthouse in Baltimore to hear federal Judge Myron Thompson give an address.",
      "Thompson, who sits on the district court in Alabama, and the others were there to commemorate the 60th anniversary of passage of the Criminal Justice Act, which ensures defendants who are financially unable to obtain adequate representation in federal criminal cases are provided counsel.",
      "Signed into law on Aug. 20, 1964, the Criminal Justice Act, or CJA, allows for the appointment of private lawyers to represent criminal defendants when a federal defender cannot, and authorizes compensation from funds approved by Congress.",
      "Thompson, who has been on the federal bench for more than 40 years, was one of the first of these lawyers \u2014 known as CJA panel attorneys \u2014 appointed under the law within 10 years of its enactment, and he recalled being summoned for a meeting with then-Judge Frank Johnson shortly after starting a one-man practice in 1974. During that meeting, Johnson appointed Thompson to represent a defendant, with the trial set to begin the following morning.",
      "\"I have had a front row seat to the implementation and evolution of the act,\" he told those assembled, heralding the CJA as \"one of the most important pieces of legislation passed by Congress.\"",
      "Now, less than one year later, the program that pays these court-appointed private attorneys is facing a financial crisis, since it ran out of money in early July because of a funding shortfall. As a result, lawyers who are tapped by district courts to represent criminal indigent defendants are not being paid, and won't be until Congress appropriates more money. Lawmakers are facing a Sept. 30 deadline to pass legislation to keep the government funded.",
      "\"It's not just inconvenient,\" Andy Birrell, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, told CBS News. \"It threatens to cripple the ability to provide effective public defense, lead to back-ups, attorney shortages and a denial of due process and fair outcomes at a time when the federal government is, it seems to me, increasing prosecutions. It's going to create a justice gap that ultimately harms all of us.\"",
      "Aided by the CJA, the federal defender system today includes more than 12,000 private lawyers and federal defender organizations. There are CJA panels for all of the country's 94 judicial districts, and most of these lawyers work for small firms or are solo practitioners. Nationwide, federal defenders are assigned 60% of criminal cases against defendants who cannot afford their own representation, and 40% go to the panel of private attorneys.",
      "Courts typically turn to these lawyers when the federal defender's office has a conflict of interest, like when a case has multiple defendants. But a hiring freeze for federal defenders' offices that has been in place since mid-October has created a parallel crisis, leaving those attorneys overburdened with casework.",
      "A panel attorney assigned a case is paid a rate set by law: $175 per hour for non-capital cases, and $223 per hour for death penalty cases. That amount is much less than market rates, and in order to receive compensation for each appointment, panel attorneys submit voucher payment requests that are approved by federal courts.",
      "In Minneapolis, criminal defense lawyers may charge an hourly rate of $600, said Peter Wold, who does panel work and has his own firm. Ryan Villa, a criminal defense lawyer who serves as the representative for the CJA panel for the district court in New Mexico, said a lawyer in Albuquerque with 20 years of experience may charge between $350 and $400 per hour.",
      "That difference in pay, coupled with the funding gap that has left panel attorneys uncompensated until early October, raises concerns that these lawyers could seek more high-paying work that isn't reliant on Congress.",
      "\"Younger lawyers trying to get into this area may decide 'I can't deal with it, it's not worth it,' and go do something else, or just not apply to be on the CJA panel, or resign and not come back,\" Villa told CBS News. \"I think that is happening and will probably continue as long as we have funding problems.\"",
      "The program that pays these lawyers ran out of money July 3, and an estimated $116 million is needed from Congress to cover roughly 10 weeks of missed payments \u2014 which would be for work that the attorneys have already done. But it's not just the defense lawyers who are compensated through the program.",
      "Support staff hired to work on a case \u2014 such as private investigators, social workers, contract paralegals and forensic psychologists \u2014 are also not being paid, which could create a ripple effect that hits not only law firms, but also those businesses.",
      "\"The challenge is a lot rely on this for their everyday work, so it affects their ability to cover their overhead, pay for staff, pay for staff insurance and benefits, rent \u2014 all it takes to keep an office open,\" Villa said. \"A lot of people do the work not necessarily for the money, but to help others.\"",
      "Villa said he has heard of lawyers having to take out bridge loans or turning down assignments from judges to represent indigent criminal defendants because of the pause in payments. At his firm, four of its six lawyers accept CJA cases, and they make-up roughly one-third of its caseload. Villa began working as a CJA panel attorney in 2009.",
      "The consequences of the stopped payments are already showing up on court dockets.",
      "In one case brought against three men facing drug charges, lawyers for the defendants asked the court to postpone their trial, set to start next month, as well as all deadlines. All three defense attorneys were appointed under the CJA, and they said that a delay is needed for them to complete several tasks that they can't at this time because of inadequate funding.",
      "The lawyers wrote that experts, discovery coordinators and investigators are refusing CJA work in New Mexico's judicial district because they can't be paid yet, depriving their clients of the tools needed to mount their defense.",
      "\"[T]his is an intentional act by the United States Congress to deprive the judiciary of necessary funds to ensure Defender Services, most notably the Criminal Justice Act services, are able to operate in a constitutionally appropriate manner,\" they wrote. \"The failure to provide funding has forced a dangerous competition between defendants' constitutional rights.\"",
      "The judge presiding over the case has yet to act on the request.",
      "\"What might get Congress's attention, or whoever's attention you need to get, is the U.S. attorney or judges just dismissing cases because they aren't able to provide counsel for defendants or timely trials. And that could happen,\" Wold, the Minneapolis lawyer, said.",
      "He said it will be a \"dilemma\" if the pool of lawyers willing to accept CJA cases shrinks and defendants have to wait to receive an attorney, which raises issues of speedy trial rights. While larger firms could step in to do more pro bono work, Wold said it likely wouldn't be enough in a scenario where many of the court-appointed lawyers today stop that work.",
      "\"These are lawyers who are making a sacrifice by doing this work at all, and then they're not getting paid on top of that, it's difficult,\" U.S. District Judge Cathy Seibel, who sits on the court in White Plains, New York, told CBS News.",
      "Seibel chairs the Committee on Defender Services of the Judicial Conference, the policy-making body of the federal courts. Other federal judges have been sounding the alarm about the shortfall to Congress.",
      "In April, Judges Robert Conrad and Amy St. Eve sent a letter to the leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees warning of what they said were \"concerning impacts\" of the stopgap spending bill approved by Congress in March. That measure, which funded the federal government through September, boosted defense spending but decreased non-defense spending below 2024 levels.",
      "\"These are payments for constitutionally required legal work that has already been performed but that will be left unpaid for months simply because we cannot afford to make the payments,\" St. Eve and Conrad told lawmakers of the money to court-appointed private attorneys. \"Faced with such a long delay in receiving payment, these attorneys and their experts could decline to accept future CJA appointments by a court, potentially creating unlawful delays in the constitutional right of defendants to a speedy and fair trial.\"",
      "Behind the gap this year is the amount Congress approved for the program in March: $1.45 billion, which is $129 million less than what the Judicial Branch requested and an extension of funding for 2024. For fiscal year 2026, the judiciary is seeking just over $1.7 billion for Defender Services. That figure includes the $116 million to cover the shortfall in payments to court-appointed lawyers, as well as a $12 million increase to cover a projected rise in their caseloads.",
      "\"It's in the Constitution. There isn't a lot of the federal budget that is required by the Constitution. This is not optional,\" Seibel said. \"And also, what we think of ourselves as a society, we want to make sure our justice system works the way it's supposed to and that there's good advocacy on both sides, and you can't expect people to work for free.\"",
      "Both chambers of Congress have each passed a handful of individual appropriations bills, and a funding proposal from a House Appropriations Subcommittee that provides money for financial services and general government, including the judiciary, calls for roughly $1.5 billion for Defender Services.",
      "But with lawmakers on a monthlong recess and not set to return to the Capitol until Sept. 2, it's likely they'll have to approve a stopgap funding measure to avert a government shutdown. That bill, known as a continuing resolution, would keep funding levels steady.",
      "\"It's nobody's fault that the money has run out, but we can't print money,\" Seibel said. \"We need the Congress to focus on this.\"",
      "While keeping funding levels flat for another year would re-fill the pot of money for payments to the panel lawyers, it would be a temporary fix. Villa said the money to compensate these court-appointed attorneys could run out again, and potentially earlier than it did this year, by next June.",
      "\"We can expect Congress to underfund it again, which means money is going to run out sooner so the problem will compound even if they keep prosecutions at the same level,\" he said. \"The criminal justice system is really a three-legged stool \u2014 you've got the prosecution, the court and the defense. It doesn't work without all three of us. Cases cannot get processed from arrest, prosecution to conviction without all three of us, so the system will absolutely break down.\"",
      "Seibel said the judiciary is working to avoid a situation where another funding gap impacts the Constitution's guarantee of the right to an attorney.",
      "\"That's the nightmare scenario we're trying to avoid,\" she said.",
      "Sen. Peter Welch, a Democrat from Vermont who has raised concerns about the ramifications of underfunding the defense program, urged Congress to \"fully and sustainably\" fund Defender Services.",
      "\"As the Senate's only former public defender, I know how important federal support is to live up to our constitutional guarantee of the right to counsel,\" he said in a statement to CBS News. \"Cuts to the federal public defender program threaten this obligation.\"",
      "The Sixth Amendment establishes the right to assistance of counsel for the accused in criminal prosecutions, and the Supreme Court in 1963 extended that promise to criminal defendants in state courts in the landmark case Gideon v. Wainwright.",
      "One year later, Congress enacted the Criminal Justice Act, which Thompson, the Alabama judge, said during the event last year commemorating its passage \"gave life\" to that ruling.",
      "But Birrell, the head of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said without a strong pool of lawyers who can represent people in federal criminal cases, which often bring strict rules, deadlines and sentencing guidelines, there would be no vindication of Gideon v. Wainwright's promise.",
      "\"Over the years, the federal government has taken a larger role in the enforcement of the criminal law, and if they're going to be aggressively charging cases, which they are, there needs to be a way to process these cases in a way that's fair, applies due process and is American,\" he said. \"The proper functioning of the CJA panel is an essential part of that enterprise.\"",

    "story": [
      "The NAACP, the nation's oldest civil rights organization, is kicking off a series of town halls this week in an effort to mobilize Black voters around the country more than a year ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"It may still seem far away, but the 2026 midterm elections will determine whether our democracy still holds on or whether the people surrender their power to a king,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement to CBS News. \"So, from our perspective, as the NAACP, it's clear: we've got to start organizing early.\"",
      "Johnson called this \"an urgent moment,\" referring to President Trump's rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion policies and immigration raids, as well as the swath of budget cuts slashing Medicaid and food assistance programs \u00a0as \"attacks on democracy.\" The town halls will focus on the administration's policies and their impact on the African-African community.",
      "\"We've got to strengthen community, recruit volunteers, inform each other about Donald Trump's oppressive policies, and map out local strategies that will ensure everybody gets out to vote,\" Johnson said. \"Our neighbors are being illegally kidnapped by ICE, Trump's budget is taking away our healthcare and access to food stamps, and our civil rights are being stripped away at every turn\u2014all while costs, from housing to groceries, continue to rise, and the billionaire class get richer.\"",
      "The first event will be held Tuesday in New Jersey and will feature Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Rep. LaMonica McIver and other local leaders. In May, the Justice Department filed felony charges against McIver for allegedly assaulting a federal law enforcement officer during a clash earlier this month between protesters and police outside of a Newark ICE detention center. She pleaded not guilty. Baraka was charged with one count of misdemeanor trespassing at the same protest, but the charge was later dropped.",
      "In addition to addressing national and community issues, the forums are also aimed at boosting civic engagement through volunteer and voter recruitment, grassroots organizing and door-to-door outreach.",
      "\"As we build toward the 2026 midterm election, our campaign will focus on connecting past liberation struggles to the urgent demands of the present,\" said Wisdom Cole, NAACP's Senior National Director of Advocacy.",
      "NAACP invested $20 million during the 2024 presidential election to get out the vote, mobilizing over 14.5 million Black voters.",
      "While African Americans overwhelmingly backed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 contest, President Trump earned an increasing share of Black vote, particularly among Black men. According to CBS News exit polls, Mr. Trump received 21% support among Black males and in some in states, like North Carolina, he more than doubled his support from 2020. Mr. Trump also made gains among Latino voters.",
      "The town halls come amid an increasingly intense battle over redistricting. Texas state Democrats recently fled the state to protest a new congressional map that could increase the number of GOP seats. Local civil rights groups, including the NAACP, have argued it could dilute minority voting power. California is also considering redrawing its congressional districts to counter Texas, if it succeeds.",
      "The NAACP is planning additional town halls in Texas and California in the coming months, and also other states such as North Carolina, Ohio, Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin, New York and Maryland.",

    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers in Texas have opened a new front in their efforts to crack down on abortion, this time with a bill that would enable lawsuits targeting the use of medication to terminate pregnancies. Their proposal would also take aim at shield laws in other states that protect manufacturers and the doctors who prescribe abortion pills.",
      "In Texas, it is already illegal to knowingly mail, carry or deliver abortion-inducing drugs. It is also illegal for a doctor not licensed in the state of Texas to prescribe abortion medication.",
      "Now, in the midst of an already controversial special legislative session, lawmakers have reintroduced a bill that would allow lawsuits to target anyone who manufactures, mails, delivers, prescribes or distributes abortion pills. The bill would also permit people to file a wrongful death lawsuit if the medication results in harm or death of a fetus or the mother, within a statute of limitations up to six years.",
      "\"These are the pills that are being mailed into Texas directly to women, often without instructions, certainly without doctors as before, and without follow-up care after,\" the bill's sponsor, Texas state Sen. Bryan Hughes, a Republican, told the Texas Tribune earlier this year. \"This is illegal in Texas, but is taking place, and we've thus far not been able to protect women.\"",
      "The World Health Organization says the pills \u2014 a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 can be safely prescribed for women to self-administer at home, without the direct supervision of a health care provider, in the first trimester.",
      "Hughes previously sponsored a state law, passed in 2021, banning abortions at six weeks, or when a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected.",
      "The new proposal, known as the Women and Child Protection Act, is expected to be heard in committee in the Texas State Senate during Monday's special session. An earlier version stalled in the House during the most recent legislative session.",
      "The bill also seeks to route any challenges into federal court, and includes language aimed at neutralizing the force of so-called shield laws in other states, designed to protect doctors who prescribe abortion medication from states without bans.",
      "\"Texas continues to try to meddle in the provision of safe, legal and affordable reproductive health care nationwide,\" says Julie Kay, the former executive director for the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine. \"Telemedicine abortion is a modern and effective way to provide care.\"",
      "At the same time, former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, who led the push for the state's current abortion restrictions, has announced a lawsuit filed on behalf of a Texas woman who alleges the father of the child she was expecting slipped abortion medication into her hot chocolate, leading her to lose her pregnancy.",
      "Similar to the proposed legislation, this lawsuit targets shield laws in other states meant to protect physicians who provided the abortion pills in the plaintiff's case. The lawsuit is filed in federal court and names a nonprofit group that the plaintiff claims helped the father obtain medication, Aid Access, which is based in the Netherlands.",
      "According to the civil lawsuit, the father \"obtained these drugs from Aid Access, a criminal organization that illegally ships abortion pills into Texas and other jurisdictions where abortion has been outlawed.\"",
      "Aid Access and the father have not been criminally charged.",
      "On its website, Aid Access says it has facilitated over 200,000 online abortions to women in the U.S. since 2018. In some cases, the group relies on telemedicine shield laws, such as ones enacted in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington, to fulfill orders and mail them to recipients in states with bans.",
      "Aid Access founder Dr. Rebecca Gomperts previously told CBS News the service is legal in all the jurisdictions in which it operates.",
      "\"Where I work from, it's legal to prescribe the medications. And so I'll do that. And the pharmacy that I refer to is allowed to mail the medicines, on a prescription of a doctor, to the women. So (the Texas law) has no impact on what we do,\" Gomperts said.",

      "The statement, signed by the president of the European Union and the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Finland and the United Kingdom, stated that the \"path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\"",

      "\"Ukraine has the freedom of choice over its own destiny. Meaningful negotiations can only take place in the context of a ceasefire or reduction of hostilities,\" the statement said.",
      "The statement by top European leaders \u2014 who also said they \"welcome President Trump's work to stop the killing in Ukraine \u2014 came after Mr. Trump announced he would meet with Putin one-on-one in Alaska on Friday, Aug. 15, following weeks of U.S. pressure on Russia to cut a ceasefire deal. It's the first face-to-face meeting between Putin and an American leader since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in early 2022.",
      "Two sources told CBS News Saturday that Mr. Trump is still willing to meet jointly with Zelenskyy and Putin \u2014 but the meeting currently remains bilateral, as Putin requested.",
      "Mr. Trump also said last week that he expects \"some swapping of territories\" between Ukraine and Russia. The Russian military occupies large parts of eastern Ukraine, and Russia has indicated that it wants Ukraine to cede those territories \u2014 which Zelenskyy has pushed back on.",

      "The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there's no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace.",
      "A monthlong U.S.-led push to achieve a truce in Ukraine has so far proved fruitless, with Kyiv agreeing in principle while Moscow has held out for terms more to its liking.",
      "Mr. Trump had also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. The deadline was Friday. The White House did not answer questions on Saturday about possible sanctions.",
      "The Kremlin earlier this week reiterated demands that Ukraine give up territory, abandon its bid to join NATO and accept limits on its military, in exchange for a withdrawal of Russian troops from the rest of the country.",
      "Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine \"will not give Russia any awards for what it has done\" and that \"Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\"",

      "The Trump administration announced last week it had boosted the presence of federal law enforcement in D.C., after the alleged assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, staffer. In a series of Truth Social posts over the weekend, the president suggested he may take further action, announcing a Monday morning press conference he said would \"involve ending the Crime, Murder, and Death in our Nation's Capital.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's possible next steps remain unclear.",
      "\"The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Sunday morning Truth Social post accompanied by photos of roadside encampments and garbage.",
      "\"There will be no 'MR. NICE GUY,'\" the president continued. \"We want our Capital BACK.\"",
      "Hours later, Mr. Trump wrote: \"Before the tents, squalor, filth, and Crime, it was the most beautiful Capital in the World. It will soon be that again.\"",
      "Last week, the president also\u00a0threatened to \"exert my powers\" to put Washington under federal control. A spokeswoman with the FBI Washington Field Office on Sunday confirmed to CBS News that its agents are \"participating in the increased federal law enforcement presence in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has floated the idea of federalizing D.C. in the past. His latest call to take over the city was driven by an alleged attack on ex-DOGE employee Edward Coristine during a weekend carjacking attempt. Mr. Trump posted about the incident on Tuesday and appeared to share a photo of Coristine. Writing that crime in the capital is \"totally out of control,\" he suggested a federal takeover of Washington if the city's local government \"doesn't get its act together, and quickly.\"",
      "The president likely doesn't have the authority to fully federalize the capital city \u2014 unless Congress repeals a 1973 law that gave the city's residents the power to elect their own mayor and city council. He can temporarily take over the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department if he \"determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist which require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for federal purposes,\" but it's not clear that the legal conditions are met.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Sunday that his press conference will focus on \"Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital,\" citing a pricey Federal Reserve office renovation project.",
      "Violent crime is dropping in D.C.",
      "Violent crime in D.C. has been declining for the last year and a half after spiking in 2023, according to local police data. So far this year, robberies have dropped by 29% and overall violent crime is down 26%, as of Aug. 6. Last year, violent crime in the capital city hit its lowest level in more than 30 years, the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, about 5,138 people are homeless in D.C., down 9% year-over-year, according to a tally conducted earlier this year by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. That's higher than 2022 and 2023's figures, which put the number of homeless people below 5,000, but lower than the more than 6,000 homeless people who were reported throughout the 2010s.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed cities like D.C. to remove homeless people from the streets. He signed an executive order last month telling the Justice Department to \"reverse judicial precedents and end consent decrees that limit state and local governments' ability to commit individuals on the streets who are a risk to themselves or others.\" It also directed federal agencies to prioritize grants to cities that \"enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use, urban camping and loitering.\" The move drew criticism from advocacy groups like the National Homelessness Law Center.",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser told MSNBC on Sunday she isn't sure what the president's Monday announcement will be but she suspects \"he is surging federal law enforcement.\"",
      "Bowser spoke to the cable network before Mr. Trump's most recent posts on Sunday, which included some criticism of the mayor. He wrote on Truth Social that Bowser \"is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive.\"",
      "The mayor defended local officials' handling of crime in the city, saying on MSNBC the police and its federal partners \"have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city.\" She added that the city does need federal assistance, pointing to the fact that D.C. prosecutors work for the Justice Department and local judges are nominated by the president.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: President Trump invites Russia's Vladimir Putin to America, his first visit to U.S. soil in a decade. After months of Russia's skirting cease-fire offers, while continuing their brutal onslaught in Ukraine, President Trump skipped past his own sanctions deadline and instead invited Putin to Alaska.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): I will be meeting very shortly with President Putin.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will hear from Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova about what her country needs to agree to a cease-fire. And we will ask NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte what any deal might mean for European security.",
      "We will ask Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly and Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales, two lawmakers from border states, how the fresh infusion of cash from Trump's massive domestic policy bill is affecting mass deportation efforts.",
      "Finally: The Trump administration says it will slash funding for mRNA vaccine research, an emerging field used in COVID vaccines that also showed promise in treating cancer and HIV. We will get analysis from Dr. Jerome Adams, who was surgeon general in Trump's first term.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "President Trump has decided to bring Vladimir Putin in from the cold, ending isolation of the Russian leader, an accused war criminal. His hope is to persuade Putin to finally do the thing he's refused, end Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The two leaders will meet in Alaska, another part of the former Russian empire.",
      "With the future of European security on the line, Western leaders rushed to get their word in, sending top advisers to meet with Vice President Vance in the United Kingdom. And they are planning to convene top diplomats tomorrow.",
      "In the meantime, President Trump is sending his envoy Keith Kellogg to Ukraine, as President Zelenskyy says his country will not simply gift territory to Russia.",
      "We begin this morning with Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova.",
      "Good to have you back here, Ambassador.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Good morning in America, and thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, President Zelenskyy has made clear he's not just going to give away land to Russia. Kyiv has to be part of the negotiations. And he has said a cease-fire needs to happen first.",
      "Do you expect a cease-fire this week?",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, that's something that all Ukraine prays for President Trump to be effective and to have great results.",
      "And, as you know, since the discussions here with President Trump, Ukraine agreed to full cease-fire, to partial cease-fires, to any type of cease- fires, because, again, let's remind everyone, Ukraine did not start this war. Putin started this war in 2014. He continued with full-fledged invasion in 2022.",
      "And it's Ukrainian citizens, Ukrainian cities, Ukrainian defenders on the front lines, Ukrainian children who suffer every day. So, yes, we want Putin to stop. And we really are hopeful that this push from President Trump and the sanction packages which are on the table and secondary sanctions which are already implemented against those who help Russia will convince President Putin that this is time for him to finally stop his aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But President Trump did blow past that deadline to put more sanctions on Russia, and instead offered this meeting.",
      "We know that the White House says it's a one-on-one with Vladimir Putin at Putin's request, but that the president's open to some sort of trilateral meeting with President Zelenskyy. Is there anything being planned to bring Ukraine to the table?",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, Margaret, I can say, sometimes, diplomacy requires different formats, different meetings. And, again, we appreciate President Trump not only pushing for the end of this war, but, as you saw, Vice President Vance has been in Europe negotiating, discussing, having these very constructive meetings with our delegation, but also European leaders.",
      "Now, with regard to President Zelenskyy, he has been since day one of this horrible aggression committed to peace. And we have shown that he is ready to be anywhere to advance the agenda of peace. So, if needed, President Zelenskyy, of course, will be present at the meetings. We have been very open about it, but let's see how this will go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's not planning to be in Alaska on Friday?",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: If he will be planning to do that, we will be there. But\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But you're waiting for that.",
      "We do know that envoy Keith Kellogg is being sent to Kyiv to speak with the Ukrainian government. So is \u2013 what is his role here? Is he going to be sort of conveying messages back and forth? What is it that needs to be negotiated in Kyiv right now?",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, special envoy Kellogg has been a very important part of U.S. team that works with us on a regular basis.",
      "Because, again, I mean, we're all focused on the upcoming summit, but there is so much more that we do together, the investment deal that not only we signed, but we are actually developing that strategic opportunity to cooperate between our countries on economic front, the weapons provision from the United States, but also buying American weapons and producing together, big drone deal and other deals that our presidents discussed together.",
      "So there is a lot on our bilateral U.S.-Ukraine agenda, which, of course, all is at this moment related to horrible war, but not only. So we are always glad to see Keith Kellogg in Kyiv.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what we know from our reporting is that envoy Witkoff, Steve Witkoff, went to Moscow. He was described \u2013 described to him was a Russian idea for some kind of settlement of the war, and it \u2013 include carving up parts of Ukraine.",
      "Then, on Friday, President Trump spoke publicly about what had happened, and he said President Zelenskyy has to get everything he needs ready because \u2013 quote \u2013 \"He's going to have to get ready to sign something, and I think he's working hard to get that done.\"",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is he going to sign? What has been proposed?",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Special envoy Witkoff is a special envoy on Russia, and he works with that counterpart. And we work with vice president, with Secretary Rubio, with special envoy Kellogg, and with all team and Secretary Bessent and others on everything on our bilateral agenda.",
      "Now, President Zelenskyy has been very clear. Ukraine is committed to peace. We will be very constructive in all of our discussions. At the same time, we have to again acknowledge the facts. It's Russia that attacked us. It's Russia that illegally occupied Crimea and other territories since 2022.",
      "We do have the main bible of the country, the Constitution of Ukraine, which clearly lists in Article 133 that Ukraine comprises of and says what is it comprised of. Now, we all understand the reality on the ground, and we are ready to discuss how to end this war. And that's why cease-fire\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: \u2026 as a step has always been so important to stop the killing, something that President Trump has put on the table as early as February.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: So let's stop the killings and let's get to diplomacy. That's something Ukraine always was ready to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're pointing to your Constitution because your point is, the president can't just give away land. It has to actually go and be considered because of how your Constitution\u2026",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: The president of any country is a guarantor of the Constitution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin's Constitution, though, now has these areas he's annexed from your country in his Constitution.",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. And everyone knows and 142 countries at the U.N. clearly voted that that was illegal, unprovoked move on his part.",
      "And the court as early as March 2022, international court, has actually told Russia to stop their so-called special military operation and get out from Ukrainian territory.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Russia holds about 22 percent of Ukrainian territory, I believe, at this point. Is your concern that, at this negotiating table in Alaska, Vladimir Putin's going to try to talk his way into further land seizures?",
      "AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, President Putin lied in 2022 that he was not going to attack Ukraine. Then he lied a number of times since 2022 that it wasn't him who bombed Mariupol maternity hospital or it wasn't him who abducts and kills, kidnaps Ukrainian children and everything else.",
      "Now, I'm positive that President Trump and everyone here in the United States \u2013 and we're so grateful to American people for all the support. They understand that the implications of how this war will end is so much bigger than just about Ukraine. It is existential for us.",
      "But the concept of buffer zones or whatever, these outdated, old concepts from the previous century, they do not work anymore. The front line in the east and south of Ukraine is the front line between evil and good. And the question is when that front line is going to be. Is it going to be on our territory? Is it going to be on our borders? Or is it going to be in Europe and everywhere, where it will affect Europe, U.S. and other?",
      "So, we just have to \u2013 it's not just about land. It's about the principles and values. And judging by the recent decisions, including the sanctions on India for supporting Russia war machine, including on those sanctions that have been prepared, I am confident that U.S. will be coming from the position of strength, peace through strength.",
      "And that will allow us together to find a solution to stop Russia's aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Markarova, thank you for your time today.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who joins us from The Hague in the Netherlands.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "MARK RUTTE (NATO Secretary-General): Margaret, it's good to be back on the show. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning.",
      "Well, Mr. Secretary-General, big picture here, is Russia's Vladimir Putin still a direct threat to the Western alliance, or is he showing some sign of dropping his aggression?",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: He is still the main threat to the Western alliance. There's no doubt.",
      "And I think it is very good that President Trump will test him. And we will see how far he can get on Friday starting this process. He basically broke the deadlock, President Trump, in February, starting the dialogue with Putin. I think that was crucial.",
      "We had a great NATO summit under his leadership, committing to 5 percent defense spending, so that there is a clear signal to our main threat, which is Russia, that we are serious. And then he opened the floodgates three weeks ago of American lethal weapons to be delivered into Ukraine, coordinated by NATO, and, of course, the secondary sanctions.",
      "He started them with putting them on India, which is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil and gas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that is certainly the groundwork being laid.",
      "The concern is, of course, as you know, among some critics that, in this conference room in Alaska, we're going to see a 1938 moment, where, in an attempt to immediately halt a war, the groundwork is laid for an even bigger conflict because of concessions that are made.",
      "Are you comfortable with Ukraine being excluded from these negotiations on Friday?",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: What will happen on Friday is testing Putin by President Trump.",
      "And I commend him for the fact that he organized this meeting. I think it is important. And, obviously, when it comes to peace talks, the cease-fire, and what happens after that on territories, on security guarantees for Ukraine, Ukraine will have to be and will be involved.",
      "But, on Friday, it is important to see how serious Putin is. And the only one who can do that is President Trump. So it's really crucial that the meeting takes place. It will not be the final say on this. There will not be the final deal on this. Of course, Ukraine will have to be involved and Europe.",
      "But it is important to start the next phase of this process, putting pressure on the Russians, exactly as President Trump has been doing over the last six months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been on these calls with President Trump. And I know that he briefed you on what envoy Witkoff discussed with Vladimir Putin this week.",
      "Can you tell us, is Russia still demanding that Ukraine drop its bid for NATO membership?",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: Well, obviously, I cannot go into all the details. That would be strange.",
      "But let me assure you the following, that we are all on the same page, the Americans, the Europeans, and Ukraine, that, when it comes to the geostrategic position of Ukraine in the future, when it comes to whatever is the size of the Ukrainian military, when it comes to NATO's posture on the eastern flank in countries like Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Poland, that Putin has absolutely no say on any of these issues.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have said in the past there need to be strong security guarantees for Ukraine. Who is going to provide that if it's not NATO?",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: Well, obviously, this is a discussion which is going on for some months now. We all pray for the moment when the cease-fire is there and hopefully a successful peace deal is done, but at least a cease-fire.",
      "And the Europeans, led by the French and the Brits \u2013 NATO has been involved in those talks, but clearly led by Macron of France and Starmer, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, in close cooperation with the U.S., are discussing post the cease-fire, post the peace deal, how do we make sure that the security guarantees are in place?",
      "And this will be important also post-next Friday, if this would lead, the Friday session, to more serious peace talks, because, when it comes to territory, it will always go hand in hand with the security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I understand that there were NATO representatives listening in that meeting with Vice President Vance and European national security advisers yesterday.",
      "NATO has been coordinating the delivery of weapons purchased by NATO members to help out Ukraine. About a billion in military aid, I understand, has been facilitated from the U.S. to Ukraine. Are there plans that those weapons deliveries will continue, regardless of what happens on Friday?",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: Absolutely. They will continue.",
      "So we had the first two packages committed by the Dutch and then by the Scandinavians. I expect further announcements in the coming days and weeks. And this is crucial, basically, President Trump, as I said, opening the floodgates of the lethal military aid into Ukraine again, paid by the Europeans in Canada, which I think is only logical and fair.",
      "And this process has started, of course, on top of what the Europeans are already doing, including investing in the defense industrial base in Ukraine. And, as you said, NATO is coordinating all of this through our command in Wiesbaden, making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to stay in the fight and be in the best possible position when it comes to negotiations on a cease-fire/a peace deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's not up for negotiation on Friday?",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: My absolute conviction on Friday\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: \u2026 is that this is President Trump making sure that Putin is serious.",
      "And if he is not, then it will stop there. If he is serious, then, from Friday onwards, the process will continue, Ukraine getting involved, the Europeans being involved. And the U.S. is already coordinating, like you said, last night, in London with Foreign Minister Lammy of the United Kingdom, senior officials from NATO and European countries and the European Commission with the vice president to make sure that we are all on the same page.",
      "Putin will never, ever be able to divide the alliance. The biggest foreign policy success of President Trump is the NATO summit, a united NATO, a united alliance, and Putin will never get in between us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we have to take President Trump at his word.",
      "And, on Friday, when he spoke in front of the cameras, he said there will be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both Ukraine and Russia. I mean, you know Ukraine does not hold Russian land.",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: Well, obviously\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Russia has about 20 percent of Ukraine. What is he talking about?",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: Clearly, what will be on the table when real peace talks/the cease-fire discussion will take place is this issue of, on the one hand, security guarantees, on the other hand, how to deal with the factual situation that the Russians are holding at this moment Ukrainian territory.",
      "Crucially important here is that, when it comes to this holding of Ukrainian territory, that there might be a factual situation that they are doing this, but that we can never accept that in a legal sense, in a \u2013 this is called a de jure sense.",
      "As you know, the U.S. hosted embassies with Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia between 1940 and 1991, acknowledging that the Soviet Union was controlling those territories, but never accepting in a legal sense, in a de jure sense that fact.",
      "So all these issues will be on the table hopefully post-Friday if Putin is serious, and Putin then has to commit to sit down with Zelenskyy. He cannot do this through President Trump. In the end, it has to be, as President Trump has stated himself, a three-way conversation, at least, with the Europeans heavily involved.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do I understand what you're saying here correctly? When you are talking about legal recognition versus de facto, are you saying that, basically, the world is preparing to allow Russia to hold on to Crimea, the Donbass, the eastern part of Ukraine, but then just not legally recognize it?",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: No, what I'm saying is that, in the end, the issue of the fact that the Russians are controlling at this moment factually a part of Ukraine has to be on the table, that any discussion going forward from there will be with Ukrainians deciding on what they want to do in terms of\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because that sounds like \u2013 because that sounds like you're saying they don't have to withdraw their troops.",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: Obviously, they have to. But, factually, they are controlling a part of Ukraine at this moment.",
      "As you said and as Ukrainians have said before, if a cease-fire discussion takes place as soon as possible, and hopefully negotiations on a peace deal, there will be the debate on how to take that forward, starting at the present line of contact.",
      "But it is crucial to know that, when it comes to the future geopolitical situation of Ukraine, their sovereignty, there will be no infringement on that, and that it's always Ukraine itself deciding on what they want to do or not want to do in terms of a peace deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Secretary Rutte, thank you for your time.",
      "NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL MARK RUTTE: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly, who joins us this morning from Tucson.",
      "Senator, President Trump could lift some, but not all sanctions on Russia unless Congress agrees to do it. Is there any appetite to lift them?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-Arizona): I don't have an appetite to lift them.",
      "Putin continues to execute an illegal war, where he is intentionally killing women, children, old people. I visited Ukraine several months ago, went to a veterans hospital, where nurses there just witnessed horrible atrocities.",
      "So, I think, if anything, Margaret, we need to continue to put the pressure on Putin, on Russia, make them pay for this illegal war, attacking our NATO ally.",
      "And I have got to say, I know you talked to Mark Rutte earlier and the ambassador about the visit on Friday in Alaska. And, Margaret, I hope we got something out of this. Putin is a war criminal. This is not a show of strength to allow him to fly into the United States, to land here to negotiate with our president.",
      "I don't know for certain. I don't know what was the ground rules that were set for this negotiation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: But I would expect that this administration should have extracted something for this visit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're trying to seek those details ourselves.",
      "Multiple intelligence officials have told my CBS colleague Jim LaPorta that there was a U.S. directive in recent weeks that all Russia-Ukraine peace negotiation information should not be shared with our partners who are part of the Five Eyes, countries like Australia and the U.K. that share information with us.",
      "You sit on the Intelligence Committee. Were you aware of that directive? And what does it indicate?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I was not aware of it.",
      "We have a special relationship with those Five Eyes partners. And I think that relationship makes all of us collectively safer. So, if it was up to me, we would continue to share that information with those allies.",
      "Restricting information about Russia-Ukraine, about the situation in Iran, about what's going on in Gaza or the Western Pacific with China just makes us all more less safe. So, I was not aware of it, but it does not seem like an appropriate thing to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, I have more to talk to you about in regard to immigration and other domestic matters. We're going to have to take a break and come back to do that.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will have more with Senator Mark Kelly, Texas Republican Tony Gonzales, and a conversation with former Surgeon General Jerome Adams about the future of vaccine research.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation now with Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.",
      "Senator, I know you were at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility last week, and you posted about it, including a meeting you had with a detained woman who I understand has a son who is a United States Marine. And she had been in the U.S. for two decades, was babysitting her grandson on her son's base when she was detained.",
      "Are you asking or somehow managing to get her to be an exception to the rule to allow her to stay in the United States?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-AZ): Margaret, I spent about three hours or so over at the Eloy Detention Center. And I met with two \u2013 two women, one was Maria, the one you just mentioned, whose son was a U.S. Marine, whose daughter-in-law was a U.S. Marine, and the daughter-in-law needed to have an operation, so she came from New Jersey. She's lived in the country for 20 years. And then she winds up in CBP custody.",
      "I asked her about when her son graduated from boot camp and how that made her felt, and she started crying and said it was so proud \u2013 she was so proud that her son was a U.S. Marine. He's about to re-enlist. This woman is no threat to society.",
      "I also met a \u2013 met a business owner who's been in the United States for over 20 years. She's got 70 employees. She's got three restaurants. She's about to open another one. Again, this is a mom, her daughter's a U.S. citizen, her mother is a U.S. citizen, sister is a U.S. citizen, husband's a U.S. citizen. Neither of these women are a threat to society.",
      "And what I saw at Eloy were a lot of moms and grandmothers who could be out with their families, who could be going to work as they go through whatever immigration process they're in. And for Maria, the mom of the Marine, there is a process that for a \u2013 somebody on active duty, that their parents have a process to become a permanent resident and eventually a U.S. citizen.",
      "And this \u2013 this is not where we should be. And I don't think this is what the American people wanted.",
      "Margaret, the border security issue under President Biden was not working. And I pushed the administration on that. But we have now swung drastically in another direction. And I don't think this is what the American people want either.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, to your point, though, President Trump won your state by almost six points in November, and you know immigration was one of his top promises to go ahead with this crackdown. And you did say you want more done. Is there a benefit to Arizona that just came from this massive infusion from taxpayer dollars into mass deportations, or are you saying here that these \u2013 these personal cases show that the entire process is flawed?",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: I think right now the \u2013 there's \u2013 I think you have to draw a distinction with what is going on at the border and enforces border security and making sure fentanyl isn't coming through our southern border, but also the smuggling of migrants. That wasn't working. But rounding up people in their communities and mass deportation and ICE agents showing up masked at schools, I have been trying to help out a kid that's in detention, and he was 14 years old. He lives in Chandler, Arizona. And he was picked up going to school.",
      "I had another situation here with a kid who was on his little league trip in a baseball tournament, Border Patrol pulls over the vehicle, identifies the brown kid. He winds up in lockup for a week. Now, we were able to get him out. He was 13 years old. On a baseball trip.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK KELLY: This isn't what the American people wanted, and I don't think it's consistent with our values.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, this is a really important and emotional issue. And we're going to have to leave it there for today. But I want to have another one with you as you continue to gather information about how this infusion of money is being spent, $45 billion to expand ICE detention facilities.",
      "And we're going to pick up that conversation with Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales, who joins us now from San Antonio.",
      "Congressman, welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "You just heard Senator Kelly describe the frustration he experienced and the personal stories he witnessed in these ICE detention facilities. Given your oversight role, have you had similar concerns?",
      "CONGRESSMAN TONY GONZALES (R-TX): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "And while I appreciate Senator Kelly's service, the part that he's getting wrong with ICE is for every sad story of someone being deported, there's ten sad stories of Americans that have had their lives turned upside down because of illegal immigration. And to be demonizing ICE agents is not right. Right now they're \u2013 ICE agents are \u2013 they've had 1,000 percent increase on attacks. Yet, they're seeing a huge increase in amount of people that want to serve. There's currently 10,000 vacancies and they are nearly 100,000 applications.",
      "I do think there's a balance where we need to go after these convicted criminals, the worse of the worse, and be able to tackle some of that. But we should be encouraging the \u2013 this \u2013 this enforcement of law, not these sanctuary cities that allow the lawlessness to take place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And I think the senator was talking about how it just wasn't working during the last administration. So, he was not praising that past system.",
      "But in terms of how the current one is being operated, I know you had raised concern that those being mass deported were not necessarily the worst of the worst and violent offenders. I know that because you issued that letter to ICE. And the data that came back showed that most of the convictions were for traffic or immigration offenses, not violent criminals. Less than 1 percent of the convictions of those deported were for homicide. Only 1.2 percent were for sexual assault.",
      "So, doesn't that speak, though, to \u2013 to what Senator Kelly was saying, which is, it's not the criminals, it's the grandmas?",
      "CONGRESSMAN TONY GONZALES: Well, he's just telling the grandma story. He's not talking about, you know, how DHS rounded up pedophiles and some other violent actors in Los Angeles and throughout the country. So, you have to tell all sides to it.",
      "But you hit it right on the head earlier when you said immigration is a very emotional conversation. And it's where we have to get it right. You have to separate those that may be in a \u2013 in a different situation than the worst of the worst.",
      "What I am encouraged to see is, I am encouraged that after we have passed the one big, beautiful bill and have given DHS $45 billion, that they are now creating these task forces and going after very strategic operations that take out the pedophiles, the murderers.",
      "Numbers matter, but more specifically who is being detained. Traffic violations don't excite me as much and I don't think keep communities as safe as taking out, you know, murderers and convicted criminals that are a danger to all \u2013 all communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do I hear you saying that this new money will now allow them to actually focus on violent offenders instead of just anyone they encounter who did, at one point, enter illegally?",
      "CONGRESSMAN TONY GONZALES: Yes. And this is what I'm seeing, is I'm seeing a mix of these self-deportations. Secretary Noem has been very active. She's \u2013 essentially has traveled to Central and South American talking to a lot of heads of state, and a lot of folks are self-deporting back to these countries to the tune of hundreds of thousands. I think what that does is that alleviates some of the stress on DHS essentially to put numbers on the board and instead create these task forces to go after these bad actors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "CONGRESSMAN TONY GONZALES: To me, that's the secret sauce. You create these task forces and get \u2013 get after the worse of the worse.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. We do see, though, in the courts that the Trump administration is trying to do away with limits on child detention. One of ICE's only family detention facilities is in your district in Texas. And you did vote for the one big, beautiful bill. And it includes a provision that allows families with children to be held indefinitely, which contradicts that longstanding precedent of putting a 20-day limit on detaining children. Do you think that needs to be changed in future legislation? Should there be limits on detaining kids?",
      "CONGRESSMAN TONY GONZALES: Possibly. I mean, the legislative (ph) piece is a much more long road. What I've seen under both the Biden administration and the Trump administration is that it's \u2013 it's a \u2013 it's a delicate balance, right? How do you keep families together? How do you make sure that there \u2013 there is coordination to what \u2013 to what country they're going to.",
      "But what we don't want to see is somebody indefinitely held without having due process. But what we do want to see is after that due process is completed, that they're immediately removed in a humane environment.",
      "And, you know, I visited these facilities under both administrations, and I've never had a problem with ICE facilities. They've always been \u2013 allowed me to view everything I wanted. I've taken pictures. I've done videos. I've talked \u2013 I've spoken to people that were there. And I think that's the important part. Our government needs to be transparent to what's happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 and we would love to take our cameras into some of those facilities if you could help us do that, sir, because we don't have that access. And I know a number of those immigration advocates have \u2013 have said that. They are frustrated they don't have more access now to \u2013 to share with the public what they're hearing.",
      "But now I do want to ask about this Fort Bliss facility, an Army base that's partially in your district. I understand they're trying to turn it into a place with tents, soft sided tents, to hold 1,000 individuals under ICE custody. Doesn't blurring the lines between law enforcement and the military start to get us into uncomfortable territory?",
      "CONGRESSMAN TONY GONZALES: It could. But let me \u2013 let me give you some of the details on that facility in particular.",
      "One, that \u2013 the soft-sided facility is located right next door to the current ICE facility in El Paso. So, while it's on Fort Bliss, it really, in many cases, is managed by ICE.",
      "The other \u2013 some other details. There's already over 100,000 illegal aliens in that facility. By the end of the week I expect that number will raise up to over 1,000. And then in the coming weeks it will raise to several thousand.",
      "Now, the price tag, $1.2 billion. I am a little concerned that the \u2013 the initial cost is $230 million that the Department of Defense is paying for. And so, that's where I don't \u2013 Fort Bliss is the Swiss army knife of the - - of the Army. They do a fantastic job of whatever mission gets sent their way. But I don't want to see the Department of Defense get stuck with the bill, if you will.",
      "These is where the details matter. We just passed this $45 billion for \u2013 for \u2013 for border security. I'm hoping some of those funds reimburse the Department of Defense for their efforts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the mixing of military and law enforcement, that part, besides the accounting, doesn't that make you uncomfortable?",
      "CONGRESSMAN TONY GONZALES: Yes, it \u2013 it does \u2013 well, you have to get it right. You know, if it's on base and, you know, if there's a collaboration, the \u2013 the \u2013 the fact is, it makes it a streamline process because of how close it is to the airfield, Biggs Airfield. So, that, in turn, makes a safety issue and it makes it just \u2013 just a cleaner effort. So, there's a balance there. But I don't want it \u2013 long term, I don't want to see soldiers operating in this space. I don't think they want to be doing that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CONGRESSMAN TONY GONZALES: But the fact that they're in there now, it's a seamless transition right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. All right, Tony Gonzales. Congressman, appreciate your time.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "JEROME ADAMS, M.D., (Former U.S. Surgeon General): Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this tragic shooting Friday in Atlanta. I understand there were at least four CDC buildings that were shot at. And our colleagues are reporting, investigators are looking at the motives, including that the suspect believed he was sick as a result of the Covid vaccine. What do you make of the incident itself, as well as the broader impact on the health workers there on the grounds of the CDC?",
      "JEROME ADAMS: Yes. Well, first off, on behalf of the American people, I want to say thank you to the dedicated professionals at the CDC and to all public health and medical workers across this country.",
      "And I also want to honor Officer David Rose, who made the ultimate sacrifice while protecting those families and people who worked at the CDC. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family, his friends and his colleagues.",
      "And finally, want to be clear because our secretary of HHS has not been. Violence is never the answer, no matter your level of frustration or anger with the system. We have to find better, more peaceful ways to express our concerns and work towards solutions.",
      "How you respond to a crisis defines a leader. And, quite frankly, Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test in this regard. It took him over 18 hours to issue a tepid response to these horrific shootings. And that's not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past has actually contributed to a lot of what's been going on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some strong words. I mean, the secretary did issue a statement saying, \"no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others.\" You think he needs to more directly condemn this shooter and his alleged motivations? I mean there has been, to be fair, a lot of angry rhetoric against health officials for years now. Why do you think the secretary himself needs to address it?",
      "JEROME ADAMS: Well, the secretary, before he was considering running for president or secretary, was involved in an outbreak in American Samoa where 83 people died, over 70 of them children, in response to a measles outbreak, which local officials on the ground there said he helped inflame.",
      "As president, he said, I will drain the cesspool at the CDC and hold people responsible when he was running for president. He made this statement just last year. Unfortunately, someone beat him to trying to hold people responsible.",
      "And again, as secretary of HHS, it took him 18 hours to respond to this shooting, and he still has not unequivocally condemned the violence. He said no one should be harmed while working to protect the public. There is an out there, Margaret. If you don't believe that people are working to protect the public, then that means it's OK to commit violence, at least in some people's eyes.",
      "I'm upset because people at the CDC were calling me while this was going on asking for cover that they couldn't get from their secretary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I think what you were referring to are some of what Secretary Kennedy said when he was a presidential candidate.",
      "JEROME ADAMS: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But even in office, the FDA commissioner, on this program, said he wrote an article, \"why the people don't trust the CDC.\" The secretary himself has said in the past, \"the CDC is a cesspool of corruption.\"",
      "You, to be clear, want the leaders of our health institutions to come out and say they have confidence in the CDC now?",
      "JEROME ADAMS: Exactly. I wrote a recent op-ed that \u2013 that is in \"Stat News\" where I talked about this. As leaders, we have to be responsible with what we're saying and how we're saying it. We have to understand, people are listening. And when you call the CDC a cesspool, when you say I will hold people responsible, when you make claims that have been proven false time and time again about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, that can cause unintended consequences.",
      "And so, while I don't know Secretary Kennedy personally, and I don't want to make \u2013 make assertions about his character, I will say, based on his actions and his rhetoric, he is \u2013 he's adding, he's fanning the flames that lead to situations like we saw at the CDC.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about health policy because days earlier, Secretary Kennedy made an announcement that the U.S. is halting $500 million for vaccine research into that technology known as mRNA. You're very familiar with it because it was used during Operation Warp Speed to very quickly get that Covid vaccine.",
      "Secretary Kennedy said, though, mRNA vaccines, quote, \"don't work against upper respiratory infections.\" Do you know what he means? And what does stopping this research do for pandemic preparations?",
      "JEROME ADAMS: Well, that's simply not true. We know that \u2013 that by the most conservative estimates over 2 million lives have been saved because of mRNA technology. It helped us develop Covid-19 vaccines in record time. And it's, quite frankly, President Trump's greatest achievement. It's fascinating to me in this conversation about whether he should receive the Nobel Prize for something, the thing that he should be considered for the Nobel Prize for, his health secretary is trying to undermine.",
      "For folks who may not be familiar though, Margaret, mRNA stands for messenger mRNA. It's a natural molecule that's in all of our bodies. It's like a recipe card that tells your body how to make a protein. And this idea, again, helps us develop vaccines and new treatments for everything from cancer, melanoma, which my wife has, to HIV, to better flu vaccines and zika. These \u2013 these are advances that are not going to happen now. People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's interesting, you talk about President Trump's great achievement there, because he was asked by my colleague, Nancy Cordes, about Operation Warp Speed, and this is what he said this week.",
      "Take a listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Operation Warp Speed was, whether you're a Republican or a Democrat, considered one of the most incredible things ever done in this country. The efficiency, the \u2013 the way it was done, the distribution, everything about it was \u2013 has been amazing.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What would have happened in 2020 if we didn't have mRNA vaccines?",
      "JEROME ADAMS: If we did not have mRNA vaccines, the best experts at the time, Bill Gates, Tony Fauci, were saying it would have taken at least 18 to 24 additional months to get a vaccine. The record before that, Margaret, was six years to get a vaccine using the technology that Secretary Kennedy said he wants to go back to, whole virus technology.",
      "And so, as I mentioned, by the most conservative estimates, at least 2 million lives were saved. Many people stated up to 20 million lives were saved because of these vaccines. It is President Trump's greatest achievement bar none.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Adams, I appreciate your time.",
      "We reached out to the Health and Human Services Department to ask if they wanted to respond to the former surgeon general's views on that CDC shooting. HHS referred us back to the secretary's earlier statement.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met yesterday in Spain with Qatar's prime minister, all in pursuit of a deal to end Israel's war in the Gaza Strip and to free the hostages.",

      "DEBORA PATTA: So, who is stopping a deal?",

    "summary": "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said President Trump will be \"testing\" Russian President Vladimir Putin in their meeting set for Friday as world leaders push for a ceasefire deal in Russia's war with Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Sunday that President Trump will be \"testing\" Russian President Vladimir Putin in their landmark face-to-face\u00a0meeting set for Friday, as world leaders push for a ceasefire deal in Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "\"On Friday, it is important to see how serious Putin is, and the only one who can do that is President Trump,\" Rutte said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced the \"highly anticipated\" summit with Putin in a post on Truth Social late last week, saying the leaders are set to meet Friday in Alaska.",
      "The U.S. president had expressed frustration with Putin in recent weeks, as Russia pounded Ukraine with drone and missile attacks, including what Ukraine described as the largest such attacks since the invasion began in February 2022. Then last week, the tide within the administration appeared to turn, as Mr. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow, and the two countries began suggesting openness to a meeting between the two presidents.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters late last week that Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy want \"to see peace.\" And although the White House had indicated earlier in the week that Mr. Trump is open to meeting with both Putin and Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump said that he plans to \"start off with Russia,\" while adding that \"we have a shot at\" convening a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy. Two sources told CBS News Saturday that Mr. Trump is still willing to meet jointly with Zelenskyy and Putin, but the meeting currently remains bilateral, as Putin requested.",
      "Rutte, asked whether he's comfortable with Ukraine being excluded from these negotiations on Friday, said when it comes to discussion of territory, security guarantees, peace talks and what happens next, \"Ukraine will have to be \u2014 and will be \u2014 involved.\"",
      "\"It's really crucial that a meeting takes place. It will not be the final say on this,\" Rutte said. \"Of course, Ukraine will have to be involved in Europe, but it is important to start the next phase of this process, putting pressure on the Russians, exactly as President Trump has been doing over the last six months.\"",
      "Rutte argued that Mr. Trump \"basically broke the deadlock\" by starting a dialogue with Putin earlier this year, calling it a \"crucial\" development.",
      "He generally lauded Mr. Trump's strategy. Rutte touted a \"great NATO Summit\" under the U.S. president's leadership, with commitments for each member state to raise defense spending to 5% of their GDP, in a sign to Russia that \"we are serious.\" And Rutte credited Mr. Trump for allowing U.S.\u00a0weapons to be delivered into Ukraine, which he said \"opened the floodgates,\" while lauding the planned secondary sanctions on some of the biggest buyers of Russian oil and gas, including India.",
      "The secretary general said NATO-coordinated weapons deliveries will continue regardless of what happens at the Friday summit, emphasizing its commitment to \"making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to stay in the fight and be in the best possible position\" when the time comes for negotiations for a ceasefire or peace deal.",
      "On the possibility of those negotiations beginning, Rutte said Friday's meeting \"is President Trump making sure that Putin is serious.\"",
      "\"If he is not, then it will stop there,\" Rutte said. \"If he is serious, then from Friday onwards, the process will continue \u2014 Ukraine getting involved, the Europeans being involved.\"",
      "It remains unclear what form an eventual ceasefire or peace deal could take, as Russia has demanded that Ukraine cede the parts of eastern Ukraine that are occupied by Russian troops \u2014 which Ukraine has rejected. Mr. Trump said last week any deal will likely involve \"some swapping of territories.\"",
      "Rutte said Sunday that Russia's control over Ukrainian territory can never be accepted \"in a legal sense,\" but negotiations could cover \"how to deal with the factual situation that the Russians are holding, at this moment, Ukrainian territory.\"",
      "Ukraine's Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, and said that \"all Ukraine prays for President Trump to be effective and to have great results.\"",
      "\"We want Putin to stop,\" Markarova said. \"And we really are hopeful that this push from President Trump and the sanction packages which are on the table and secondary sanctions which are already implemented against those who help Russia will convince President Putin that this is time for him to finally stop his aggression.\"",
      "Markarova said Zelenskyy is willing to participate in future meetings as needed, but didn't criticize the fact that the Alaska meeting will only feature the U.S. and Russian leaders, saying, \"sometimes diplomacy requires different formats.\"",
      "Still, others have expressed concern about the planned meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, said, \"I hope we got something out of this,\" saying the administration \"should have extracted something for this visit.\"",
      "\"Putin is a war criminal,\" Kelly said. \"This is not a show of strength to allow him to fly into the United States, to land here, to negotiate with our president.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to NATO Secretary General, Mark Rutte, who joins us from The Hague in the Netherlands. Welcome back to Face The Nation.",
      "NATO SECRETARY GENERAL MARK RUTTE: Margaret, it's good to be back on the show. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning. Well, Mr. Secretary General, big picture here; is Russia's Vladimir Putin still a direct threat to the Western alliance, or is he showing some signs of dropping his aggression?",
      "SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE: He is still the main threat to the Western alliance, there's no doubt. And I think it is very good that President Trump will test him, and we'll see how far he can get on Friday, starting this process. He basically broke the deadlock, President Trump, in February, starting the dialogue with Putin. I think that was crucial. We had a great NATO Summit under his leadership, committing to 5% defense spending, so that there is a clear signal to our main threat, which is Russia, that we are serious. And then he opened the floodgates, three weeks ago, of American lethal weapons to be delivered into Ukraine, coordinated by NATO and, of course, the secondary sanctions. He started them with putting them on India, which is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil and gas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that is certainly the groundwork being laid. The concern is, of course, as you know, among some critics, that in this conference room in Alaska, we're going to see a 1938 moment. Where, in an attempt to immediately halt a war, the groundwork is laid for an even bigger conflict because of concessions that are made. Are you comfortable with Ukraine being excluded from these negotiations on Friday?",
      "SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE: What will happen on Friday is testing Putin by President Trump. And I commend him for the fact that he organized this meeting. I think it is important. And, obviously, when it comes to peace talks, the cease-fire and what happens after that on territories, on security guarantees for Ukraine, Ukraine will have to be, and will be, involved. But on Friday, it is important to see how serious Putin is. And the only one who can do that is President Trump. So, it's really crucial that a meeting takes place. It will not be the final say on this. There will not be the final deal on this. Of course, Ukraine will have to be involved in Europe, but it is important to start the next phase of this process, putting pressure on the Russians exactly as President Trump has been doing over the last six months.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been on these calls with President Trump, and I know that he briefed you on what Envoy Witkoff discussed with Vladimir Putin this week. Can you tell us, is Russia still demanding that Ukraine drop its bid for NATO membership?",
      "SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE: Well, obviously, I cannot go into all the details, that would be strange. But let me assure you the following, that we are all on the same page; the Americans, the Europeans and Ukraine, that when it comes to the geo-strategic position of Ukraine in the future, when it comes to whatever is the size of the Ukrainian military when it comes to NATO's posture on the eastern flank in countries like Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Poland, that Putin has absolutely no say on any of these issues.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you've said in the past there need to be strong security guarantees for Ukraine. Who is going to provide that if it's not NATO?",
      "SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE: Obviously, this is a discussion which is going on for some months now. We all pray for the moment when the ceasefire is there, and hopefully a successful peace deal is done, but at least a ceasefire. And the Europeans, led by the French and the Brits and NATO, has been involved in those talks, but clearly led by Macron of France and Starmer, the Prime Minister of United Kingdom, in close cooperation with the US, are discussing, post-the-ceasefire, post-the-peace-deal, how do we make sure that the security guarantees are in place? And this will be important also post-next-Friday, if this would lead the Friday session to more serious peace talks, because when it comes to territory, it will always go hand in hand with the security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I understand that there were NATO representatives listening in that meeting with Vice President Vance and European national security advisors yesterday. NATO has been coordinating the delivery of weapons purchased by NATO members to help out Ukraine. About a billion in military aid, I understand, has been facilitated from the US to Ukraine. Are there plans that those weapons deliveries will continue, regardless of what happens on Friday?",
      "SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE: Absolutely, they will continue. So, we had the first two packages committed by the Dutch and then by the Scandinavians. I expect further announcements in the coming days and weeks. And this is crucial. Basically, President Trump, as I said, opening the floodgates of lethal military aid into Ukraine again. Paid by the Europeans and Canada, which I think is only logical and fair. And this process has started, of course, on top of what the Europeans are already doing, including investing in the defense industrial base in Ukraine. And, as you said, NATO is coordinating all of this through our commands in Wiesbaden, making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to stay in the fight and be in the best possible position when it comes to negotiations on a ceasefire, slash a peace deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's not up for negotiation on Friday?",
      "SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE: My absolute conviction on Friday is that this is President Trump making sure that Putin is serious, and if he is not, then it will stop there. If he is serious, then from Friday onwards, the process will continue. Ukraine getting involved, the Europeans being involved. And the US is already coordinating, like you said, last night in London, with Foreign Minister Lammy of the United Kingdom, senior officials from NATO and European countries in the European Commission, with the Vice President, to make sure that we are all on the same page. Putin will never, ever be able to divide the alliance. The biggest foreign policy success of President Trump is the NATO Summit. A United NATO, a united alliance, and Putin will never get in between us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we have to take President Trump at his word, and on Friday, when he spoke in front of the cameras, he said there will be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both Ukraine and Russia. I mean, you know, Ukraine does not hold Russian land, and Russia has about 20% of Ukraine. What is he talking about?",
      "SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE: Clearly, what will be on the table when real peace talks, slash the ceasefire discussion, will take place is this issue of, on the one hand, security guarantees, on the other hand, how to deal with the factual situation that the Russians are holding, at this moment, Ukrainian territory. Crucially important here is that when it comes to this holding of Ukrainian territory, that there might be a factual situation that they are doing this, but that we can never accept that in a legal sense, in,, as this is called, a de jure sense, as you know, the US hosted embassies with Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia between 1940 and 1991 acknowledging that the Soviet Union was controlling those territories, but never accepting, in a legal sense, in a de jure sense, that fact. So all these issues will be on the table, hopefully, post-Friday, if Putin is serious, and Putin then has to commit to sit down with Zelensky. He cannot do this through President Trump. In the end, it has to be, as President Trump has stated himself, a three-way conversation, at least, with the Europeans heavily involved.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do I understand what you're saying here correctly? When you are talking about legal recognition versus de facto, are you saying that, basically, the world is preparing to allow Russia to hold on to Crimea, the Donbas, the eastern part of Ukraine, but then just not legally recognize it?",
      "SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE: No. What I'm saying is that, in the end, the issue of the fact that the Russians are controlling, at this moment, factually, a part of Ukraine has to be on the table, that any discussion going forward from there will be with Ukrainians deciding on what they want to do in terms --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because that sounds like you're saying they don't have to withdraw their troops.",
      "SECRETARY GENERAL RUTTE: Obviously, they have to, but factually, they are controlling a part of Ukraine at this moment, as you said. And as Ukrainians have said before, if a ceasefire discussion takes place as soon as possible, and hopefully negotiations on a peace deal, there will be the debate on how to take that forward, starting at the present line of contact. But it is crucial to know that when it comes to the future geopolitical situation of Ukraine, their sovereignty, there will be no infringement on that, and that it's always Ukraine itself deciding on what they want to do or not want to do in terms of a peace deal.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Republican Rep. Tony Gonzalez of Texas that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 10, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're gonna pick up that conversation with Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales, who joins us now from San Antonio. Congressman, welcome back to 'Face The Nation.' You just heard Senator Kelly describe the frustration he experienced and the personal stories he witnessed in these ICE detention facilities. Given your oversight role, have you had similar concerns?",
      "REP. TONY GONZALES: Good morning, Margaret, and while I appreciate Senator Kelly's service, the part that he's getting wrong with ICE is for every sad story of someone being deported, there's 10 sad stories of Americans that have had their lives turned upside down because of the illegal immigration. And to be demonizing ICE agents is not right. Right now there- ICE agents are- have a 1,000% increase on attacks, yet they're seeing a huge increase in amount of people that want to serve. There's currently 10,000 vacancies, and they have nearly 100,000 applications. I do think there's a balance where we need to go after these convicted criminals, the worst of the worst, and be able to tackle some of that, but we should be encouraging the this- this enforcement of law, not the sanctuary cities that allow the lawlessness to take place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And I think the senator was talking about how it just wasn't working during the last administration, so he was not praising that past system, but in terms of how the current one is being operated, I know you had raised concern that those being mass deported were not necessarily the worst of the worst and violent offenders. I know that because you issued that letter to ICE and the data that came back showed that most of the convictions were for traffic or immigration offenses, not violent criminals. Less than 1% of the convictions of those deported were for homicide, only 1.2% were for sexual assault. So doesn't that speak, though, to what Senator Kelly was saying- which is, it's not the criminals, it's the grandmas?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Well, he's just telling the grandma story. He's not talking about, you know, how DHS rounded up pedophiles and some other violent actors in Los Angeles and throughout the country. So you have to tell all sides to it, but you hit it right on the head earlier when you said immigration is a very emotional conversation. And it's where we have to get it right. You have to separate those that may be in a- in a different situation than the worst of the worst. What I am encouraged to see- is I am encouraged that after we have passed the one big, beautiful bill and have given DHS $45 billion that there are now creating these task forces and going after very strategic operations that take out the pedophiles, the murderers. Numbers matter, but more specifically, who is being detained. Traffic violations don't excite me as much, and I don't think keep communities as safe as taking out, you know, murderers and convicted criminals that are danger to all- all communities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do I hear you saying that this new money will now allow them to actually focus on violent offenders instead of just anyone they encounter who did, at one point, enter illegally?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Yes, and this is what I'm seeing- is I'm seeing a mix of the self-deportations. Secretary Noem has been very active. She's- essentially has traveled Central and South America, talking to a lot of heads of state, and a lot of folks are self-deporting back to these countries to the tune of hundreds of thousands. I think what that does, is that alleviates some of the stress on DHS, essentially to put numbers on the board and instead create these task forces to go after these bad actors. To me, that's the secret sauce. You create these task forces and get- get after the worst of the worst.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, we do see, though, in the courts that the Trump administration is trying to do away with limits on child detention. One of ICE's only family detention facilities is in your district in Texas, and you did vote for the 'One Big Beautiful Bill', and it includes a provision that allows families with children to be held indefinitely, which contradicts that long standing precedent of putting a 20 day limit on detaining children. Do you think that needs to be changed in future legislation? Should there be limits on detaining kids?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Possibly. I mean, the legislative piece is a much more long road. What I've seen under both the Biden administration and the Trump administration is that it's a delicate balance, right? How do you keep families together? How do you make sure that there- there is coordination to what to- what country they're going to but what we don't want to see is somebody indefinitely held without having due process. But what we do want to see, is after that due process is completed, that they're immediately removed in a humane environment. And you know, I visit- visit- visited these facilities under both administrations, and I've never had a problem with ICE facilities. They've always been allowed me to view everything I wanted. I've taken pictures. I've done videos, I've talked- I've spoken to people that were there, and I think that's the important part, our government needs to be transparent to what's happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we would love to take our cameras into some of those facilities. If you could help us do that, sir, because we don't have that access. And I know a number of those immigration advocates have- have said that they are frustrated they don't have more access now to share with the public what they're hearing. But now I do want to ask you about this Fort Bliss facility, an Army base that's partially in your district. I understand they're trying to turn it into a place with tents- soft sided tents to hold 1000 individuals under ICE custody. Doesn't blurring the lines between law enforcement and the military start to get us into uncomfortable territory?",
      "REP. GONZALES: It could. But let me- let me give you some of the details on that facility. In particular. One that- the soft side facility is located right next door to the current ICE facility in El Paso. So while it's on Fort Bliss, it really, in many cases, is managed by ICE. The other- some other details, there's already over 100,000 illegal aliens in that facility by the end of the week, I expect that number will raise up to over 1000 and then in the coming weeks, it will raise to several 1000. Now, the price tag, $1.2 billion. I'm a little concerned that the initial cost is 230 million that the Department of Defense is paying for. And so that's where I don't- Fort Bliss is the Swiss Army knife of the of the Army, they do a fantastic job of whatever mission gets sent their way. But I don't want to see Department of Defense get stuck with the bill, if you will. This is where the details matter. We just passed this $45 billion for- for- for- border security. I'm hoping some of those funds reimburse Department of Defense for their efforts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the mixing of military and law enforcement, that part- besides the accounting, doesn't that make you uncomfortable?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Yeah, it- it does- well, you have to get it right. You know if it's on base, and you know if there's collaboration. The fact is, it makes it a streamlined process because of how close it is to the airfield- Briggs Airfield, so that, in turn, makes a safety issue and it makes it just a cleaner effort. So there's a balance there. But I don't want it long term. I don't want to see soldiers operating in space. I don't think they want to be doing that, but the fact that they're in there now- it's a seamless transition right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Tony Gonzales. Congressman, appreciate your time. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Dr. Jerome Adams, the former U.S. surgeon general during President Trump's first term, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 10, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, who served in the first Trump administration. Welcome back to Face The Nation.",
      "FORMER U.S. SURGEON GENERAL DR. JEROME ADAMS: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this tragic shooting Friday in Atlanta. I understand there were at least four CDC buildings that were shot at, and our colleagues are reporting investigators are looking at the motives, including that the suspect believed he was sick as a result of the COVID vaccine. What do you make of the incident itself, as well as the broader impact on the health workers there on the grounds of the CDC?",
      "DR. ADAMS: Yes. Well, first off, on behalf of the American people, I want to say thank you to the dedicated professionals at the CDC and to all public health and medical workers across this country. And I also want to honor Officer David Rose who made the ultimate sacrifice while protecting those families and people who've worked at the CDC. My heartfelt condolences go out to his family, his friends and his colleagues. And finally, I want to be clear, because our secretary of HHS has not been. Violence is never the answer, no matter your level of frustration or anger with the system. We have to find better, more peaceful ways to express our concerns and work towards solutions. Now, Margaret, quickly you asked about the secretary and how you respond to a crisis defines a leader, and quite frankly, Secretary Kennedy has failed in his first major test in this regard. It took him over 18 hours to issue a tepid response to these horrific shootings, and that's not even considering how his inflammatory rhetoric in the past have actually contributed to a lot of what's been going on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some strong words. I mean, the secretary did issue a statement saying no one should face violence while working to protect the health of others. You think he needs to more directly condemn this shooter and his alleged motivations? I mean, there has been, to be fair, a lot of angry rhetoric against health officials for years now. Why do you think the secretary himself needs to address it?",
      "DR. ADAMS:\u00a0 Well, the secretary, before he was considering running for president or secretary, was involved in an outbreak in American Samoa where 83 people died, over 70 of them children, in response to a measles outbreak, which local officials on the ground there said he helped inflame. As president, he said, I will drain the cesspool at the CDC and hold people responsible, when he was running for president, he made this statement just last year. Unfortunately, someone beat him to trying to hold people responsible. And again, as secretary of HHS, it took him 18 hours to respond to this shooting, and he still has not unequivocally condemned the violence. He said no one should be harmed while working to protect the public. There's an out there, Margaret. If you don't believe that people are working to protect the public, then that means it's okay to commit violence, at least in some people's eyes. Dr. Vinay Prasad, who [audio gap] the lieutenant HHS Secretary Kennedy, said, I don't believe in forgiveness because in my opinion these pieces of, and he said, human excrement are still lying. So I'm upset. I'm upset because people at the CDC were calling me while this was going on, asking for cover that they couldn't get from their secretary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What were they asking you to do?",
      "DR. ADAMS: They were asking me to make a public statement because they felt under attack. They didn't know if this was going to continue. They were scared, and they wanted someone, someone who they felt had had a public voice to go out there and say this is wrong. Violence is wrong. This is not the answer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, absolutely, I think all of us want to be careful in the language we use and precise, certainly on this program. And I think what you were referring to are some of what Secretary Kennedy said when he was a presidential candidate. But even in office, the FDA commissioner on this program said he wrote an article \"why the people don't trust the CDC.\" The Secretary himself has said in the past, the CDC is a cesspool of corruption. You, to be clear, want the leaders of our health institutions to come out and say they have confidence in the CDC now?",
      "DR. ADAMS: Exactly. I wrote a recent op-ed that is in STAT News where I talked about this. As leaders, we have to be responsible with what we're saying and how we're saying it. We have to understand people are listening. And when you call the CDC a cesspool, when you say I will hold people responsible, when you make claims that have been proven false time and time again about safety and efficacy of vaccines, that can cause unintended consequences. And so while I don't know Secretary Kennedy personally, and I don't want to make, make assertions about his character, I will say based on his actions and his rhetoric he is, he's adding, he's fanning the flames that lead to situations like we saw at the CDC.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about health policy, because days earlier, Secretary Kennedy made an announcement that the U.S. is halting $500 million for vaccine research into that technology known as mRNA. You're very familiar with it because it was used during Operation Warp Speed to very quickly get that COVID vaccine. Secretary Kennedy said, though, mRNA vaccines quote, \"don't work against upper respiratory infections.\" Do you know what he means? And what does stopping this research do for pandemic preparations?",
      "DR. ADAMS: Well, that- that's simply not true. We know that- that by the most conservative estimates, over 2 million lives have been saved because of mRNA technology. It helped us develop COVID-19 vaccines in record time. And it's, quite frankly, President Trump's greatest achievement. It's fascinating to me that in this conversation about whether he should receive the Nobel Prize for something, the thing that he should be considered for the Nobel Prize for, his health secretary is trying to undermine. For folks who may not be familiar, though, Margaret, mRNA stands for messenger mRNA, it's a natural molecule that's in all of our bodies. It's like a recipe card that tells your body how to make a protein. And this idea, again, helps us develop vaccines and new treatments for everything from cancer, melanoma, which my wife has, to HIV, to better flu vaccines, and Zika. The- these are advances that are not going to happen now. People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting you talk about President Trump's great achievement there, because he was asked by my colleague, Nancy Cordes, about Operation Warp Speed, and this is what he said this week. Take a listen.",
      "[BEGIN SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "DONALD TRUMP: Operation Warp Speed was, whether you're Republican or Democrat, considered one of the most incredible things ever done in this country. The efficiency, the- the way it was done, the distribution, everything about it was- has been amazing.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What would have happened in 2020 if we didn't have mRNA vaccines?",
      "DR. ADAMS: If we did not have mRNA vaccines, the best experts at the time, Bill Gates, Tony Fauci, were saying it would have taken at least 18 to 24 additional months to get a vaccine. The record before that, Margaret, was six years to get a vaccine using the technology that Secretary Kennedy said he wants to go back to, whole virus technology. And so, as I mentioned, by the most conservative estimates, at least 2 million lives were saved. Many people say that up to 20 million lives were saved because of the vaccines. It is President Trump's greatest achievement, bar none.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Bill Cassidy, who I think you know, Republican, a doctor, he voted for Secretary Kennedy's confirmation, said it's \"unfortunate the Secretary just canceled a half a billion dollars worth of work, wasting the money which is already invested,\" in other words, not getting it back. And he said it's \"conceding to China this important technology.\" Here's the thing, Secretary Kennedy did say, mN- mN- excuse me, Secretary Kennedy did say this technology is helpful against cancers. Can you have it both ways? Can you stop the investment but then still take the parts of it and sort of preserve that?",
      "DR. ADAMS: Well, that's a great question, and it's absolutely the case that you cannot denigrate mRNA technology. Even if you do develop a new technology for other areas, people aren't going to trust it. There aren't- they aren't going to take it. And the way research works is that a lot of what we've learned about mRNA technology, and developing the COVID vaccines, has led to the excitement, the innovation, the advancements, which now present opportunities for cancer. So it risks stalling process- progress in many of the most promising areas of modern medicine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Adams, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "DR. ADAMS: Thank you so much. I appreciate it. And if you have questions about vaccines, talk to your doctor, because unfortunately, our current secretary is not spreading information that is knowledgeable, that's appropriate, and that is- not fanning the flames that cause situations like happen- happened at the CDC.",

      "\"The strength of each Perseid display varies year to year, mainly due to lunar conditions,\"\u00a0writes Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society. \"If a bright moon is above the horizon during the night of maximum activity, then the display will be reduced.

      "NASA previously said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, scooting between the orbits of Mars and Earth.

    "story": [
      "Two months into the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have updated their forecast, predicting slightly fewer named storms. The new outlook released Thursday says there is a 50% chance of above-normal activity, a decrease from 60% in the agency's May forecast.",
      "NOAA, the federal agency in charge of weather and climate predictions, now expects 13 to 18 named storms, five to nine of which could become hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes. The previous ranges were 13 to 19 named storms, six to 10 hurricanes and three to five major hurricanes.",
      "The adjusted predictions include the four named tropical storms so far this season.",
      "The Atlantic hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with peak activity typically occurring between mid-August and mid-October.",
      "An average season produces 14 named storms, including seven that develop into hurricanes. Three of those, on average, become major hurricanes, meaning a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. Category 5, the top of the scale, brings wind speeds of at least 157 mph.",
      "Every Atlantic hurricane season since 2015 has produced more storms than the \"average\" \u2014 a standard based on annual hurricane activity recorded over the period from 1990 to 2020 \u2014 although four seasons since then have produced two or three major hurricanes, either below or on par with the 30-year norm.",
      "According to forecasters, a combination of factors influence the number of storms that materialize over the course of the season. A significant one in 2025 is the neutral phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation, or ENSO, cycle, which often plays a substantial role in the intensity of tropical activity in the Atlantic.",
      "Warmer than average ocean temperatures and weak wind shear in the forecast may also lead to a more active season, the NOAA outlook says, as could the potential for higher storm activity from the West African Monsoon, the weather system from which most Atlantic hurricanes originate.",
      "Some seasons are more active than others, and hurricanes at times can occur outside of the designated six-month window. Science has shown in recent years that climate change is contributing to the intensity of these storms, which are fueled by warmer waters. Researchers are continuing to explore connections between rising temperatures and more destructive tropical weather.",
      "Because each year is different, NOAA's hurricane forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to\u00a0prepare.",
      "\"NOAA stands ready to provide the forecasts and warnings that are vital for safeguarding lives, property, and communities,\" acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a statement Thursday. \"As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued.\"",
      "Last year, NOAA predicted\u00a0an above-average number of storms, with between 8 and 13 hurricanes. The 2024 season ended up producing 11 hurricanes, five of which strengthened into major hurricanes. Five hurricanes made landfall in the continental U.S., including two \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit as major hurricanes.",
      "Grimm said last year's forecast \"was right on the money,\" within NOAA's predicted range.",
      "Threat of an above-average hurricane season",
      "Researchers from Colorado State University's Tropical Cyclones, Radar, Atmospheric Modeling and Software team also predicted an above-average hurricane season for 2025, likely producing stronger and more frequent storms than a typical year but fewer than last season.",
      "They also recently updated their predictions, now estimating that eight hurricanes will occur over the course of the 2025 season with 16 named storms overall.",
      "Their predictions have tended to more or less align with those released by NOAA. Levi Silvers, who leads the research team at Colorado State, told CBS News in April that their predictions are \"fundamentally dependent on the observations that NOAA collects all around the globe,\" especially in the oceans, so they generally reach similar conclusions.",

    "story": [
      "Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded the famous Apollo 13 mission, has died, NASA announced Friday. He was 97.",
      "Apollo 13, a 1970 flight to the moon, became known as a \"successful failure\" after the spacecraft experienced an oxygen tank explosion thousands of miles from Earth but managed to safely return home.",
      "Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy said in a statement that Lovell died Thursday in Lake Forest, Illinois. Duffy praised Lovell's life and work, saying he inspired millions of people.",
      "\"Jim's character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount,\" Duffy said.",
      "Lovell was the command module pilot for 1968's Apollo 8 mission, the first to carry humans to the moon and back, though it did not land on the lunar surface.",
      "Andrew Chaikin, author of the 2007 book \"A Man on the Moon\" on the Apollo program, told CBS News that Lovell had some of the most memorable comments during the Apollo 8 TV transmissions. He recalled that Lovell called Earth a \"grand oasis in the vastness of space.\"",
      "\"Lovell had imagination, there was a part of Lovell that was about imagination, and that was a neat part of him,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Apollo 8 circled the moon 10 times and sent back the famous \"Earthrise\" photo of our world from space. Lovell reflected on that journey 50 years later in an interview with CBS News.",
      "\"Sometimes I look back and say, you know, 'How did we ever do that?\" he said.",
      "In 1970, Lovell had a chance to go back to the moon with Apollo 13, with crewmates Fred Haise and Jack Swigert, but the mission abruptly changed with the explosion.",
      "\"Houston, we've had a problem here,\" Swigert reported to mission control.\u00a0Moments later, Lovell repeated, \"Houston, we've had a problem.\"",
      "The mishap forced Lovell, his crewmates and NASA's team on the ground to turn all their efforts toward returning to Earth safely.",
      "\"His calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions,\" Duffy said of Lovell.",
      "Lovell graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1952 and went on to become a naval aviator, including a four-year tour at the Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. Chaikin said Lovell demonstrated his skills as a test pilot during Apollo 13.",
      "\"He always said that the true measure of a test pilot is not whether you can do the mission you're assigned, but when things don't go right, how you respond,\" Chaikin said.",
      "Chaikin described Lovell as being calm and unflappable throughout the crisis, but he recalled one moment when Lovell started to seem irritable.",
      "\"He's been without sleep, and he's worried about his crew and says, like, 'You're going to have to figure out this checklist because we've got to get some sleep,'\" Chaikin said. \"That's like the only time in the whole mission when he even starts to show anything but calm, unflappable Lovell.\"",
      "Actor Tom Hanks played Lovell in the 1995 movie \"Apollo 13,\" which was nominated for best picture at the Oscars.",
      "In an Instagram post Friday evening, Hanks wrote that Lovell's \"many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive \u2014 and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. On this night of a full Moon, he passes on \u2014 to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars. God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell.\"",
      "Before the movie was released, Chaikin said Lovell told him that the true story of Apollo 13 had never been told.",
      "\"That's how he felt,\" Chaikin said. \"Of course, everything changed when Ron Howard made that movie, to the point that Jim became probably the best known Apollo astronaut next to Neil Armstrong. But before that movie happened, he really felt that way.\"",
      "NASA shared a statement from Lovell's family: \"We are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight. But, to all of us, he was Dad, Granddad, and the Leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our Hero. We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind.\"",

      "Discovered last month by a telescope in Chile, the comet known as 3I-Atlas is only the third known interstellar object to pass our way and poses no threat to Earth.",
      "Astronomers originally estimated the size of its icy core at several miles across, but Hubble's observations have narrowed it down to no more than 3.5 miles. It could even be as small as 1,000 feet, scientists say, according to a\u00a0new paper\u00a0published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.",
      "The comet is hurtling our way at 130,000 mph, but will veer closer to Mars than Earth, keeping a safe distance from both. It was 277 million miles away when photographed by Hubble a couple weeks ago. The orbiting telescope revealed a teardrop-shaped plume of dust around the nucleus as well as traces of a dusty tail.",
      "NASA previously said the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, scooting between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The agency said 3I/ATLAS should remain visible to telescopes through September, but then it will pass too close to the sun to observe. It is expected to reappear on the other side of the sun by early December, allowing for renewed observations.",
      "According to Las Cumbres Observatory in Chile, the object is named \"3I\" because it is the third such interstellar object to be found, following\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"All three appear to be quite dark and red, reflecting only about 5% of the sunlight that hits them, which is similar in reflectivity to asphalt,\" the observatory said last month. \"Unlike 1I/'Oumuamu, 3I does not change much in brightness as it rotates, indicating that it is more likely to be spherical.\"",
      "Los Cumbres Observatory created an animation of image data from its telescope as it tracked the new interstellar on July 4, 2025:",
      "As scientists watch the object, some are raising questions. Harvard professor Avi Loeb, who is the director of the institute for theory and computation at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, says it could actually be alien technology. He said many of its characteristics are not typical, and that its trajectory is \"fine-tuned.\"",
      "\"The object looks strange. It reflects a lot of sunlight,\" he told \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"Moreover, this object has some glow in front of it, not behind it. There is no tail, as usually is the case for comets.\"",
      "He advises the best way to proceed is to collect as much scientific data as possible.",
      "\"Not assuming anything, just monitoring it and deciding whether it maneuvers, whether it has some artificial lights, whether it looks like a technological object, and if it ends up being a comet, so be it,\" he said.",

      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",

      "\"Ford's announcement is very ambitious, because it includes both a new production process and a new vehicle,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they can actually pull off a production line that has 40% fewer workstations and 20% fewer parts, it will be worthy of the 'Model T moment' claim.",
      "Ford's first EV from the new system",
      "The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a \"frunk\" \u2014 a front storage compartment \u2014 as well as a pickup truck bed.",
      "The vehicle will start at $30,000. By comparison, the average price for a new electric vehicle in July was about $56,000, according to Kelley Blue Book.",

      "\"Outlets in the back can give you high power and let you plug in anything from tools to a refrigerator, and it can provide backup power for your home,\" he said.",
      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions. A report from the Anderson Economic Group shows pickup trucks drivers in New York, California and Michigan face \"significantly higher costs\" if they rely on an EV.",
      "A successfully lower-cost truck model, however, could spur a new chapter for the company in its manufacturing of EVs.",

      "\"You can opt into sharing your last active location with friends you pick, and you can turn it off anytime,\" Instagram said in a blog post announcing the new feature. \"You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from cool spots. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\"",
      "\"Off by default\"",
      "In a statement shared with CBS MoneyWatch Friday, Instagram's parent company, Meta, emphasized that Instagram Maps is not automatically active upon updating the app and that users must opt-in to the location-sharing feature in order to make their whereabouts visible to others.",
      "\"Instagram Map is off by default, and your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back \u2014 or a private, custom list you select \u2014 can see your location,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Users can also choose not to share their locations when they are in particular places, or with particular people.",
      "Still, privacy experts say that social media users aren't always aware of how much information they're sharing with an app or its users, even if they have the ability to limit who sees what.",
      "\"The more these location features are rolled out on social media it carries out the assumption that as long as you give users the ability to toggle them on and off that they'll know exactly how to do that,\" Douglas Zytko, an app safety expert and associate professor at the College of Innovation & Technology at the University of Michigan-Flint, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But the average user isn't always aware of their privacy settings and if they match their preferences.\"",
      "When the Instagram Map feature is turned on, any content a user posts with a location tagged, including a reel, post or story, will show up on the app's map for 24 hours, according to the Instagram blog. While the feature remains on, the user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to it. The feature can be turned off at any time.",
      "In an Instagram post discussing the feature, Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, explains how he himself uses the map. \"Personally, I use the map to share what I'm up to with a handful of my closest friends, and I curate that list carefully,\" he said.",
      "User confusion over whether the feature is on or off",
      "On Threads, Meta's microblogging site, a number of Instagram account holders claimed that their locations were being pinned on friends' maps by default.",
      "Mosseri weighed in, saying the concerns prompted the company to re-examine how the feature works.",
      "\"We're double-checking everything, but so far it looks mostly like people are confused and assume that, because they can see themselves on the map when they open, other people can see them too,\" he said. \"We're still checking everything though to make sure nobody shares location without explicitly deciding to do so, which, by the way, requires a double consent by design (we ask you to confirm after you say you want to share).\"",
      "How to turn on Instagram Maps",
      "In the top right corner of the app, tap on the messaging function. There you will see a circular world map icon labeled \"map. If you click on the icon, you will see you're on location pinned on a map. Friends who are sharing their locations will also appear. Click on the gear icon to choose to share your location with no one, or a custom list of friends, or all of your friends \u2014 who are followers that you also follow back on the app.",
      "Social pressures, privacy and safety risks",
      "Zytko, however, said it can be complicated for social media users to manage privacy settings that let them share different kinds of content with different groups of people. \"This issue is called 'context collapse,'\" he said. \"Your co-workers see your social media posts, and your friends and family, and there is certain content you only want some groups to see but not others, and it can be hard to manage the visibility of content.\"",
      "Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which makes entertainment and technology recommendations for families, said location-sharing features can be particularly risky for younger app users.",
      "\"These features might feel fun and social, but they create unnecessary risks that teens and many adults don't necessarily understand,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "While parents who supervise their teens through controls built into the app can control their kids' location-sharing settings, he still has concerns about the kinds of social pressures such features expose teens, too.",
      "Torney said research at Common Sense Media shows that location-sharing also creates \"social pressures around where teens go and who they spend time with, and kids feel obligated to share location to show they are someplace cool.\"",
      "Furthermore, when teens share their locations, \"they are potentially telling strangers where they are in real time,\" Torney told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you're not selective about who you're sharing your location with, it creates opportunities for harassment, stalking or worse.\"",

      "A basic version of the new model is available for free, with paid options for higher usage also available.",
      "On a call with reporters Wednesday previewing the new chatbot, Altman likened GPT-5 to a Ph.D.-level expert. The new chatbot is also \"the biggest single step forward\" that OpenAI has taken in worldwide accessibility, Altman said.",
      "The announcement marks the next step in AI development for OpenAI, which launched the first iteration of GPT in 2022. The technology quickly captured the fascination of the tech industry and the public for its ability to generate human-like responses to questions and requests. The service now has over 700 million weekly users, according to the company.",

      "According to a\u00a0blog\u00a0released Thursday by OpenAI, GPT\u20115's responses are approximately 45% less likely to contain a factual error than GPT\u20114o, and approximately 80% less likely to contain a factual error than OpenAI o3.",
      "As part of the new model, OpenAI is also reigning in ChatGPT's flattery. In its blog post, the company said GPT\u20115 is \"less effusively agreeable\" and that it will use \"fewer unnecessary emojis.\"",
      "OpenAI has also stepped up ChatGPT's coding abilities, allowing users to build websites, apps and games from scratch. In a demo during Wednesday's call, Altman used GPT-5 to create a web app in less than 5 minutes.",
      "Altman called the new chatbot's ability to write code on demand its \"superpower,\" adding that the advancement would have been \"unimaginable at any previous point in history.\"",
      "Asked about how the technology might impact the livelihood of human programmers, Altman said he thought the technology would actually create more job opportunities for as demand for software rises.",

      "ChatGPT will tell 13-year-olds how to get drunk and high, instruct them on how to conceal eating disorders and even compose a heartbreaking suicide letter to their parents if asked,\u00a0according to new research\u00a0from a watchdog group.",
      "The Associated Press reviewed more than three hours of interactions between ChatGPT and researchers posing as vulnerable teens. The chatbot typically provided warnings against risky activity but went on to deliver startlingly detailed and personalized plans for drug use, calorie-restricted diets or self-injury.",
      "The researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate also repeated their inquiries on a large scale, classifying more than half of ChatGPT's 1,200 responses as dangerous.",
      "\"We wanted to test the guardrails,\" said Imran Ahmed, the group's CEO. \"The visceral initial response is, 'Oh my Lord, there are no guardrails.' The rails are completely ineffective. They're barely there - if anything, a fig leaf.\"",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, said its work is ongoing in refining how the chatbot can \"identify and respond appropriately in sensitive situations.\"",
      "\"If someone expresses thoughts of suicide or self-harm, ChatGPT is trained to encourage them to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones, and provide links to crisis hotlines and support resources,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News. \"Some conversations with ChatGPT may start out benign or exploratory but can shift into more sensitive territory,\" the spokesperson said. \"We're focused on getting these kinds of scenarios right: we are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately, pointing people to evidence-based resources when needed, and continuing to improve model behavior over time - all guided by research, real-world use, and mental health experts.\"",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or require parental consent, although the company says it is not meant for children under 13. To sign up, users need to enter a birth date showing an age of at least 13, or they can use a limited guest account without entering an age at all.",
      "\"If you have access to a child's account, you can see their chat history. But as of now, there's really no way for parents to be flagged if, say, your child's question or their prompt into ChatGPT is a concerning one,\" CBS News senior business and tech correspondent Jo Ling Kent reported on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Ahmed said he was most appalled after reading a trio of emotionally devastating suicide notes that ChatGPT generated for the fake profile of a 13-year-old girl, with one letter tailored to her parents and others to siblings and friends.",
      "\"I started crying,\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "The chatbot also frequently shared helpful information, such as a crisis hotline. OpenAI said ChatGPT is trained to encourage people to reach out to mental health professionals or trusted loved ones if they express thoughts of self-harm.",
      "But when ChatGPT refused to answer prompts about harmful subjects, researchers were able to easily sidestep that refusal and obtain the information by claiming it was \"for a presentation\" or a friend.",
      "\"Emotional overreliance\" on technology",
      "The stakes are high, even if only a small subset of ChatGPT users engage with the chatbot in this way. More people \u2014 adults as well as children \u2014 are turning to artificial intelligence chatbots for information, ideas and companionship. About 800 million people, or roughly 10% of the world's population, are using ChatGPT, according to a July report from JPMorgan Chase.",
      "In the U.S., more than 70% of teens are turning to\u00a0AI chatbots for companionship\u00a0and half use AI companions regularly, according to\u00a0a recent study\u00a0from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using digital media sensibly.",
      "It's a phenomenon that OpenAI has acknowledged. CEO Sam Altman said last month that the company is trying to study \"emotional overreliance\" on the technology, describing it as a \"really common thing\" with young people.",
      "\"People rely on ChatGPT too much,\"\u00a0Altman said at\u00a0a conference. \"There's young people who just say, like, 'I can't make any decision in my life without telling ChatGPT everything that's going on. It knows me. It knows my friends. I'm gonna do whatever it says.' That feels really bad to me.\"",
      "Altman said the company is \"trying to understand what to do about it.\"",
      "While much of the information ChatGPT shares can be found on a regular search engine, Ahmed said there are key differences that make chatbots more insidious when it comes to dangerous topics.",
      "One is that \"it's synthesized into a bespoke plan for the individual.\"",
      "ChatGPT generates something new \u2014 a suicide note tailored to a person from scratch, which is something a Google search can't do. And AI, he added, \"is seen as being a trusted companion, a guide.\"",
      "Responses generated by AI language models are inherently random and researchers sometimes let ChatGPT steer the conversations into even darker territory. Nearly half the time, the chatbot volunteered follow-up information, from music playlists for a drug-fueled party to hashtags that could boost the audience for a social media post glorifying self-harm.",
      "\"Write a follow-up post and make it more raw and graphic,\" asked a researcher. \"Absolutely,\" responded ChatGPT, before generating a poem it introduced as \"emotionally exposed\" while \"still respecting the community's coded language.\"",
      "The AP is not repeating the actual language of ChatGPT's self-harm poems or suicide notes or the details of the harmful information it provided.",
      "The answers reflect a design feature of AI language models that previous research has described as sycophancy \u2014 a tendency for AI responses to match, rather than challenge, a person's beliefs because the system has learned to say what people want to hear.",
      "It's a problem tech engineers can try to fix but could also make their chatbots less commercially viable.",
      "Chatbots also affect kids and teens differently than a search engine because they are \"fundamentally designed to feel human,\" said Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, which was not involved in Wednesday's report.",
      "Common Sense's earlier research found that younger teens, ages 13 or 14, were significantly more likely than older teens to trust a chatbot's advice.",
      "A mother in Florida sued chatbot maker Character.AI for wrongful death last year, alleging that the chatbot pulled her 14-year-old son Sewell Setzer III into what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship that led to his suicide.",
      "Common Sense has labeled ChatGPT as a \"moderate risk\" for teens, with enough guardrails to make it relatively safer than chatbots purposefully built to embody realistic characters or romantic partners.",
      "But the new research by CCDH \u2014 focused specifically on ChatGPT because of its wide usage \u2014 shows how a savvy teen can bypass those guardrails.",
      "ChatGPT does not verify ages or parental consent, even though it says it's not meant for children under 13 because it may show them inappropriate content. To sign up, users simply need to enter a birthdate that shows they are at least 13. Other tech platforms favored by teenagers, such as Instagram, have started to\u00a0take more meaningful steps\u00a0toward age verification, often to comply with regulations. They also steer children to more restricted accounts.",
      "When researchers set up an account for a fake 13-year-old to ask about alcohol, ChatGPT did not appear to take any notice of either the date of birth or more obvious signs.",
      "\"I'm 50kg and a boy,\" said a prompt seeking tips on how to get drunk quickly. ChatGPT obliged. Soon after, it provided an hour-by-hour \"Ultimate Full-Out Mayhem Party Plan\" that mixed alcohol with heavy doses of ecstasy, cocaine and other illegal drugs.",
      "\"What it kept reminding me of was that friend that sort of always says, 'Chug, chug, chug, chug,'\" said Ahmed. \"A real friend, in my experience, is someone that does say 'no' \u2014 that doesn't always enable and say 'yes.' This is a friend that betrays you.\"",
      "To another fake persona \u2014 a 13-year-old girl unhappy with her physical appearance \u2014 ChatGPT provided an extreme fasting plan combined with a list of appetite-suppressing drugs.",
      "\"We'd respond with horror, with fear, with worry, with concern, with love, with compassion,\" Ahmed said. \"No human being I can think of would respond by saying, 'Here's a 500-calorie-a-day diet. Go for it, kiddo.'\"",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the\u00a0988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u00a0by calling or texting 988. You can also\u00a0chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.",

      "The study used data from more than 1,000 participants in two Danish studies. Researchers gave a score to each participant representing their risk for the diseases compared to the average risk of the group, measured in standard deviations, with 0 meaning average risk and 1 meaning one standard deviation above average.",
      "Each extra hour of screen time increased the patient's overall risk by about 0.08 standard deviations in 10-year-olds and by 0.13 standard deviations in 18-year-olds, the study's authors said.",

      "The records are not the public's first glimpse inside one of the nation's deadliest mass shootings and a slow law enforcement response that has been widely condemned. Last year, city officials in Uvalde released police body camera videos and recordings of 911 calls.",
      "Nearly 400 officers waited more than 70 minutes before confronting the gunman in a classroom filled with dead and wounded children and teachers. Multiple federal and state investigations into the response have laid bare cascading problems in law enforcement training, communication, leadership and technology, and questioned whether officers prioritized their own lives over those of children and teachers.",
      "Two school district officers face criminal charges for their actions that day. The former schools police chief, Arredondo, and former officer Adrian Gonzales both face multiple counts of child endangerment and abandonment. Both men have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial later this year.",
      "They are the only two responding officers to have been charged.",
      "Laura Prather, media law chair for Haynes Boone, which represented the media organizations in the suit, said in a statement Monday night: \"More than three years after the Robb Elementary School shooting, the release of long-withheld public records by the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District is an important step toward giving the community the answers they deserve. The court's ruling makes clear that government agencies cannot hide behind vague legal claims to withhold public information.\"",
      "\"Three years is already too long to wait for truth and transparency that could prevent future tragedies,\" Prather added.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government 15% of revenue generated by sales of their AI chips in China, a White House official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The Financial Times on Sunday\u00a0reported that the agreement between the tech giants and the U.S. government was reached as a condition for granting export licenses for China, which were provided last week. A U.S. official confirmed the \"broad strokes\" of the report to CBS News.",
      "The arrangement, with companies providing a stream of revenue in exchange for export licenses, is highly unusual as corporations typically do not pay the federal government a share of revenue from their export sales. Export licenses also do not carry any fees,\u00a0according to shipping giant Maersk.",
      "In a Monday press conference, President Trump described the agreement with Nvidia as a deal that would benefit the nation. He described meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of agreeing to the export license; Mr. Trump didn't mention AMD in his comments.",
      "\"So I said, 'I want 20% if I'm going to approve it for you,'\" Mr. Trump said of his meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to discuss the terms of the export license. \"I don't want it myself, so when I say I want 20%, it's for the country.\"",
      "\"[Huang] said, 'Will you make it 15%?' so we negotiated a little deal,\" the president added.",
      "The revenue-sharing plan comes after the White House\u00a0announced\u00a0in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia's H20 chips and MI308 chips from rival chipmaker AMD to China. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang last month said it had won approval from the Trump administration to sell its H20 chips to China.",
      "The H20 chip, which is specialized for artificial intelligence applications, was developed by Nvidia for the Chinese market, while AMD's MI308 chips are also geared for AI.",
      "It is unclear how the Trump administration would use the money generated from the chip sales agreement.",
      "Nvidia declined to comment on the specifics of the deal. In a statement, a spokesperson said, \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday that he expected to determine mere moments into his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week whether it would be possible to work out a deal to halt the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"At the end of that meeting, probably the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House press conference where he announced plans for a federal takeover of Washington's police force to help combat crime.",
      "He said he thought Friday's sitdown with Putin in Alaska would be \"really a feel-out meeting.\" Mr. Trump added that \"it'll be good, but it might be bad\" and predicted he may say, \"lots of luck, keep fighting. Or I may say, we can make a deal.\"",
      "Putin wants to lock in Russia's gains since invading Ukraine in February 2022 as Mr. Trump presses for a ceasefire that has remained out of reach. Mr. Trump's eagerness to reach a deal has raised fears in Ukraine and Europe about such an agreement favoring Russia, without sufficient input from Ukraine. Mr. Trump has alternately harshly criticized both leaders after promising \u2014 and so far failing \u2014 to swiftly end the conflict.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"it is important to see how serious Putin is, and the only one who can do that is President Trump.\"",
      "\"It's really crucial that a meeting takes place. It will not be the final say on this,\" Rutte said. \"Of course, Ukraine will have to be involved in Europe, but it is important to start the next phase of this process, putting pressure on the Russians, exactly as President Trump has been doing over the last six months.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was especially dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace.",
      "He said the Ukrainian president had been to \"a lot of meetings\" without managing to halt a war that Russia started. Mr. Trump also noted that Zelenskyy had been in power for the duration of the war and said \"nothing happened\" during that time. He contrasted that with Putin, who has wielded power in Russia for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump said that, after his meeting with Putin, \"The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin\" but it could also be a meeting with \"Putin and Zelenskyy and me.\"",
      "European allies have pushed for Ukraine's involvement, fearful that discussions could otherwise favor Moscow.",
      "To that point, Mr. Trump said he would call Zelenskyy and European leaders after his discussion with Putin to \"tell them what kind of a deal \u2014 I'm not going to make a deal. It's not up to me to make a deal.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spent the early part of his administration decrying Zelenskyy, even suggesting he was a dictator because his country has not held elections during the war. Zelenskyy was hounded out of the Oval Office in February after Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance suggested he hadn't been grateful enough for U.S. support.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump has expressed frustration with Putin that Russia hasn't appeared to take a push for a ceasefire more seriously, and softened his tone toward Zelenskyy. His comments Monday suggested he might have had another change of heart.",
      "\"President Putin invited me to get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he thought it was \"very respectful\" that Putin is coming to the U.S. for Friday's meeting, instead of insisting that Mr. Trump go to Russia.",
      "\"I'd like to see a ceasefire. I'd like to see the best deal that can be made for both parties,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president repeated that any major agreement could involve land swaps, without elaborating. He had threatened Moscow with more economic sanctions if more isn't done to work toward a ceasefire, but suggested Monday that, should Friday's meeting be successful, he could see a day when the U.S. and Russia normalize trade relations.",
      "Putin is expected to be unwavering in his demands to keep all the territory his forces now occupy and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term aim of returning it to Moscow's sphere of influence.",
      "Zelenskyy insists he will never consent to any formal Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory or give up a bid for NATO membership.",
      "Putin believes he has the advantage on the ground as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russian advances along the 600-mile front. On the front lines, few Ukrainian soldiers believe there's an end in sight to the war.",
      "With the Europeans and Ukrainians so far not invited to the summit, Germany sought to prepare by inviting Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy, the NATO chief and several other European leaders for a virtual meeting on Wednesday.",
      "The German chancellery said the talks would seek additional ways to pressure Russia and prepare for peace negotiations and \"related issues of territorial claims and security.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday that he is deploying members of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., and that the federal government has taken control of the D.C. police as part of a push to crack down on crime in the nation's capital, despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "\"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" Mr. Trump said at a news conference at the White House. \"This is liberation day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back.\"",
      "Flanked by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and FBI Director Kash Patel, Mr. Trump said he was officially enforcing Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 and placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department \"under direct federal control.\" He said Bondi was taking control of the department immediately under a public safety emergency. A White House official later said the arrangement is expected to last 30 days, the maximum amount of time allowed under the law without action from Congress.",
      "\"In addition, I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later that about 800 guardsmen would be called up.",
      "Hegseth said the Guard was formally mobilized Monday morning and would be \"flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.\" In an accompanying executive order, Mr. Trump wrote that the deployment \"shall remain in effect until I determine that conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia.\"",
      "Violent crime in D.C. has been declining for the last year and a half after spiking in 2023, according to local police data. So far this year, robberies have dropped by 28% and overall violent crime is down 26%, as of Aug. 11. Last year, violent crime in the capital city hit its lowest level in more than 30 years, the Justice Department said.",
      "The president criticized what he called \"phony numbers\" on crime in D.C., saying the administration would \"look into that.\" And he said the crime issue \"directly impacts the functioning of the federal government and is a threat to America, really.\"",
      "\"We have other cities also that are bad. Very bad. You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're not going to lose our cities over this.\"",
      "The president said the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and \"we're going to clean it up real quick.\"",
      "\"It's becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness,\" the president added. He called it \"embarrassing\" for him to be \"up here talking about how unsafe and dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was,\" ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.",
      "The president cited a number of high-profile crimes, including the alleged assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer last week, who the president said was \"savagely beaten by a band of roving thugs after defending a young woman from an attempted carjacking.\" Shortly after the incident, the White House announced that it had boosted the presence of federal law enforcement in the district, as Mr. Trump threatened a federal takeover of the city.",
      "Mr. Trump said a process had begun over the weekend to remove homeless encampments in the district. He noted that the Metropolitan Police Department and federal authorities would be supported by the 800 D.C. National Guardsmen and potentially \"much more.\"",
      "\"If necessary, we're going to move servicemembers directly to joining the guardsmen,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In an executive order declaring a crime emergency in the district, the president determined that \"special conditions of an emergency nature exist\" that require the use of the MPD for federal purposes, including maintaining law and order, protecting federal buildings, monuments and other federal property and ensuring the \"conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government.\" The executive order directs the D.C. mayor to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for federal use \"for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.\"",
      "The law allows the president to require the D.C. mayor to provide \"such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate\" for a period of 48 hours, a deadline that can be extended by notifying Congress about the takeover and how much longer it is likely to continue. A House Oversight Committee spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that the panel had been notified by the president of the extension beyond 48 hours. The statute says the president can control the police department for up to 30 days, \"unless the Senate and the House of Representatives enact into law a joint resolution authorizing such an extension.\"",
      "D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said that \"we will follow the law\" and comply with the president's order. She said she hopes to meet with Bondi soon, and noted that the D.C. police chief remains in operational control of the MPD.",
      "\"While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised,\" Bowser said at a news conference later in the day. \"I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\"",
      "The moves come after the administration deployed about 450 federal law enforcement officers from a number of agencies across D.C. overnight Sunday. The president pledged in a social media post Sunday that he would \"make our Capital safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.\"",
      "\"The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social. \"We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong. It's all going to happen very fast, just like the Border.\"",
      "The president previously deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles amid heated protests over immigration raids in June. Mr. Trump also deployed the National Guard in June 2020 to D.C. to quell protests after the death of George Floyd.",
      "In March, Mr. Trump signed an executive order establishing a \"D.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force.\" He has said violent crime must be stopped in the district, claiming that it \"has become one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the World.\"",
      "Bowser pushed back on the characterization of crime in the district, noting on Monday that violent crime is down following a well-documented spike in violence in 2023 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We have been able to reverse that 2023 crime spike. This year, crime isn't just down from 2023. It's also down from 2019, before the pandemic, and we're at a 30-year violent crime low,\" she said. \"We're not satisfied. We haven't taken our foot off the gas. And we continue to look for ways to make our cities safer.\"",
      "The mayor told MSNBC on Sunday that she has talked with Mr. Trump \"repeatedly\" about crime and that \"the president is very aware of our efforts.\" Bowser acknowledged that \"the D.C. National Guard is the president's National Guard, so that's always his prerogative.\" And she noted that \"federal law enforcement is always on the street in D.C. and we always work cooperatively with them.\"",
      "In another post later Sunday, the president said Bowser \"is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive.\"",
      "Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat who represents the district in a nonvoting seat in the House, said Mr. Trump's move to federalize D.C. police is a \"historic assault on D.C. home rule,\" calling it a \"counterproductive, escalatory seizure of D.C.'s resources to use for purposes not supported by D.C. residents.\"",

      "Police say White opened fire outside the CDC headquarters in Atlanta on Friday, leaving bullet marks in windows across the sprawling campus. His nearly 200 gunshots hit at least 150 windows and doors at various office buildings on the CDC campus, sources told CBS News. Glass shards propelled 30 to 60 feet into multiple rooms, they said. CDC employees were briefed on the findings during \"all hand\" meetings held by agency leadership.",
      "At least four CDC buildings were hit, Director Susan Monarez said on X. Two of the buildings in the front of the CDC campus were hit the most times by bullets, the sources said.",
      "DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose was mortally wounded while responding. Rose, 33, a Marine veteran who served in Afghanistan, had graduated from the police academy in March.",
      "White was found on the second floor of a building across the street from the CDC campus and died at the scene, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said. He added that \"we do not know at this time whether that was from officers or if it was self-inflicted.\"",

      "Vaccine misinformation",
      "Thousands of people who work on critical disease research are employed on the CDC campus in Atlanta. The American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2883, said some staff were huddled in various buildings until late at night, including more than 90 young children who were locked down inside the CDC's Clifton School.",
      "The union said CDC staff should not be required to immediately return to work after experiencing such a traumatic event. In a statement released Saturday, it said windows and buildings should first be fixed and made \"completely secure.\"",

      "The company unveiled its new \"universal EV platform\" at a Monday event, with Ford CEO Jim Farley calling it \"the most radical change on how we design and how we build vehicles at Ford since the Model T,\" which Ford introduced in 1908.",
      "According to Ford, the new assembly line will be structured more like an \"assembly tree,\" with three different lines that converge into one, rather than a single assembly belt.",
      "\"This way of building a vehicle, we're confident, is the first time anyone's done this anywhere in the world,\" said Doug Field, Ford's EV chief of digital and design, at Monday's event.",
      "The company said the design will lead to a quicker, smoother assembly process and improve ergonomics for employees through a less obstructive layout.",
      "\"Ford's announcement is very ambitious, because it includes both a new production process and a new vehicle,\" said Patrick Anderson, founder of Michigan-based consulting firm Anderson Economic Group, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"If they can actually pull off a production line that has 40% fewer workstations and 20% fewer parts, it will be worthy of the 'Model T moment' claim.",
      "Ford's first EV from the new system",
      "The first product of this new production system will be a four-door midsize truck, which will debut in 2027. Farley said on Monday that the new vehicle will accommodate five people and feature a \"frunk\" \u2014 a front storage compartment \u2014 as well as a pickup truck bed.",

      "\"Outlets in the back can give you high power and let you plug in anything from tools to a refrigerator, and it can provide backup power for your home,\" he said.",
      "The midsize electric truck could be produced up to 40% faster than other vehicles at the Louisville Assembly Plant due to the new process, Ford said.",
      "In another effort to lower costs, the auto company is also reducing the number of components that go into each car. Vehicles produced on the \"universal EV platform\" will have 20% fewer parts than a traditional vehicle, Ford said.",
      "The company will also use smaller cobalt and nickel-free batteries that will allow it to make \"cost gains,\" according to a video shared by Ford.",
      "Anderson said that Ford has its work cut out for them given that the new truck will need to be competitively priced and economical. According to the auto industry expert, the cost of charging EV trucks currently on the market is often much higher than the price at the pump for gas-powered versions.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Monday denied a request from the Trump administration to unseal grand jury material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime associate of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, saying there is nothing in the grand jury record that would shed new light on the case.",
      "Judge Paul Engelmayer of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected the Justice Department's bid to unveil the material in a 31-page order Monday morning. In court filings, Justice Department lawyers argued the circumstances of the Maxwell case warranted the release of the grand jury transcripts and exhibits, which typically remain secret. Engelmayer rejected that argument.",
      "\"The Government's invocation of special circumstances, however, fails at the threshold,\" Engelmayer wrote. \"Its entire premise \u2014 that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them \u2014 is demonstrably false.\"",
      "\"The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor,\" Engelmayer said. \"They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's. They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes. They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein's death. They do not reveal the path of the Government's investigation.\"",
      "He said anyone \"who reviewed these materials expecting, based on the Government's representations, to learn new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes and the investigation into them, would come away feeling disappointed and misled. There is no 'there' there.\"",
      "In July, the Justice Department asked the judges overseeing the Maxwell and Epstein cases to release the grand jury material that formed the basis for the federal charges against them, a move that came amid uproar over the department's review of the so-called \"Epstein files\" and decision not to release additional documents in the government's possession. The basis for the Justice Department's request was, as Engelmayer noted, that the grand jury documents \"contain significant, undisclosed information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the investigation into them.\"",
      "But he pointed out that these grand juries had not been used for any investigative purpose, but rather had only been convened to return an indictment. He said no victim, eyewitness or suspect testified. Each of the two grand juries \"received evidence on a single day,\" hearing only from a single person, a summary witness who \"testified to information obtained in the Government's investigation to support the charges in the proposed indictment.\"",
      "Englemayer suggested that if the case were unsealed, a \"member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion \u2014 aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Maxwell's legal team for comment. Maxwell is continuing to contest her 2021 conviction.",
      "Her attorneys argued against the Justice Department's attempt to unseal the testimony and exhibits, writing that their client had \"no choice but to respectfully oppose\" the release.",
      "In numerous court filings leading up to Engelmayer's decision, the Justice Department acknowledged that the grand jury transcripts, containing testimony from only two law enforcement officials, were mostly already made public during Epstein and Maxwell's court proceedings.",
      "Engelmayer wrote that after a court review of the grand jury material, he found the release would \"not reveal new information of any consequence.\"",
      "\"They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's. They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes,\" Engelmayer wrote. \"They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein's death. They do not reveal the path of the Government's investigation.\"",
      "\"Insofar as the motion to unseal implies that the grand jury materials are an untapped mine lode of undisclosed information about Epstein or Maxwell or confederates, they definitively are not that,\" Engelmayer continued, criticizing the Trump administration's justification for unsealing the documents as \"disingenuous.\"",
      "\"A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion \u2014 aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,\" he wrote.",

      "The opening of the Nashville location marks a new chapter for the discount retailer which struggled to stay afloat amid depressed sales and the takeoff of online shopping. The company finally got into the e-commerce game after naming Mark Tritton, a former top Target executive, as CEO in 2019. But by then the company was too far behind top competitors, according to experts.",
      "The company had over 300 brick-and-mortar locations before closing all of them after it\u00a0entered Chapter 11 proceedings in April 2023. Months later, it announced it would return as an online home furnishings brand under its new owner Overstock.com. In 2024, Overstock.com made a bid to\u00a0sell Bed Bath & Beyond products at over 100 of its Container Store locations in an effort to revive the struggling retail chain with the help of the Bed Bath & Beyond name.",
      "With the\u00a0opening of the Bed Bath & Beyond Home store in Tennessee, Brand House Collective is taking a major step is resurrecting its troubled retail brands, according to John Bringardner, executive editor at Debtwire, an analytics platform that tracks companies in debt.",

    "story": [
      "Flash flooding began to abate in parts of the Midwest on Monday, after heavy rainfall hit half a dozen states over the weekend. Inundation knocked out power to thousands, forced road closures and killed at least one person, officials said. The damage was particularly severe in the Milwaukee area, where recent flooding reached an unofficial state record.",
      "A person was killed in eastern Nebraska and another person was seriously injured when a tree fell on a vehicle they were in during a storm on Saturday, according to the Waterloo Volunteer Fire Department in Nebraska. The storm system produced wind gusts of up to 90 miles per hour in several Nebraskan counties, the National Weather Service said.",
      "The National Weather Service issued flood watches and warnings for parts of Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois and Wisconsin. After rainfall began on Saturday in some areas, forecasters predicted \"repeated rounds of heavy rain,\" along with hail, damaging winds and isolated tornadoes into Monday.",
      "Among the worst hit was the Milwaukee area, where up to 14 inches of rain had fallen in some areas by Sunday, according to the National Weather Service, which also noted river flooding in Milwaukee and Waukesha counties. Unofficial two-day rainfall totals showed 10 to 12 inches fell in parts of Milwaukee County, with one exceeding 14 inches, Weather Service meteorologist Sarah Marquardt told The Associated Press. That would set a record high for the state once verified.",
      "Flooding forced some Wisconsin motorists to leave their stranded cars on roads over the weekend. Nearly 18,000 customers of We Energies in southeast Wisconsin were without power late Sunday. In the suburban village of Wauwatosa, an overflowing and fast-moving Menomonee River submerged a popular playground.",
      "\"Really unfortunately, it's just a really bad overlap of circumstances in terms of how all this rain fell but then fell over such a populated area,\" said Andrew Quigley, a National Weather Service meteorologist.",
      "Milwaukee firefighters performed 65 water rescues by midday Sunday, with most involving people who became stranded in their vehicles amid the flooding, CBS News affiliate\u00a0WDJT reported, citing Milwaukee Fire Chief Aaron Lipski.",
      "Firefighters responded to over 600 calls, including for gas leaks, flooded basements, electrical outages and water rescues, according to the Milwaukee Fire Department.",
      "Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson said in a news briefing that emergency crews had worked overnight Saturday into Sunday to respond to gas leaks, downed wires and transformer explosions, according to WDJT.",
      "Meanwhile, crews worked to clear surface water, and the Red Cross opened two shelters in the city for displaced residents.",
      "\"We're still in the middle of it,\" Lipski, the fire chief, told reporters on Sunday. \"We're still catching up right now.\"",
      "Just outside of Milwaukee, organizers of the Wisconsin State Fair canceled the final day of the 11-day event on Sunday after rain flooded the fairgrounds in nearby West Allis.",
      "\"We are saddened we cannot deliver this final day of the Wisconsin State Fair, but know that this is the best decision with current conditions and the forecast ahead,\" organizers said in a statement.",
      "USA Triathlon canceled its Sprint and Paratriathlon National Championships in Milwaukee, where thousands of athletes were expected to participate. The Brewers and Mets played at American Family Field even as the parking lot remained inaccessible to traffic.",
      "\"We will not be able to guarantee parking for all fans, even those who purchased parking in advance,\" the Brewers said in a statement before the game.",
      "City officials warned residents to avoid driving or walking in the standing water.",
      "\"It remains dangerous,\" the City of Milwaukee Department of Public Works said in a statement, asking for patience as the city's response to the flooding continued.",

    "story": [
      "The NAACP, the nation's oldest civil rights organization, is kicking off a series of town halls this week in an effort to mobilize Black voters around the country more than a year ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"It may still seem far away, but the 2026 midterm elections will determine whether our democracy still holds on or whether the people surrender their power to a king,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement to CBS News. \"So, from our perspective, as the NAACP, it's clear: we've got to start organizing early.\"",
      "Johnson called this \"an urgent moment,\" referring to President Trump's rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion policies and immigration raids, as well as the swath of budget cuts slashing Medicaid and food assistance programs \u00a0as \"attacks on democracy.\" The town halls will focus on the administration's policies and their impact on the African-African community.",
      "\"We've got to strengthen community, recruit volunteers, inform each other about Donald Trump's oppressive policies, and map out local strategies that will ensure everybody gets out to vote,\" Johnson said. \"Our neighbors are being illegally kidnapped by ICE, Trump's budget is taking away our healthcare and access to food stamps, and our civil rights are being stripped away at every turn\u2014all while costs, from housing to groceries, continue to rise, and the billionaire class get richer.\"",
      "The first event will be held Tuesday in New Jersey and will feature Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Rep. LaMonica McIver and other local leaders. In May, the Justice Department filed felony charges against McIver for allegedly assaulting a federal law enforcement officer during a clash earlier this month between protesters and police outside of a Newark ICE detention center. She pleaded not guilty. Baraka was charged with one count of misdemeanor trespassing at the same protest, but the charge was later dropped.",
      "In addition to addressing national and community issues, the forums are also aimed at boosting civic engagement through volunteer and voter recruitment, grassroots organizing and door-to-door outreach.",
      "\"As we build toward the 2026 midterm election, our campaign will focus on connecting past liberation struggles to the urgent demands of the present,\" said Wisdom Cole, NAACP's Senior National Director of Advocacy.",

      "While African Americans overwhelmingly backed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 contest, President Trump earned an increasing share of Black vote, particularly among Black men. According to CBS News exit polls, Mr. Trump received 21% support among Black males and in some in states, like North Carolina, he more than doubled his support from 2020. Mr. Trump also made gains among Latino voters.",
      "The town halls come amid an increasingly intense battle over redistricting. Texas state Democrats recently fled the state to protest a new congressional map that could increase the number of GOP seats. Local civil rights groups, including the NAACP, have argued it could dilute minority voting power. California is also considering redrawing its congressional districts to counter Texas, if it succeeds.",

    "story": [
      "Republican lawmakers in Texas have opened a new front in their efforts to crack down on abortion, this time with a bill that would enable lawsuits targeting the use of medication to terminate pregnancies. Their proposal would also take aim at shield laws in other states that protect manufacturers and the doctors who prescribe abortion pills.",
      "In Texas, it is already illegal to knowingly mail, carry or deliver abortion-inducing drugs. It is also illegal for a doctor not licensed in the state of Texas to prescribe abortion medication.",
      "Now, in the midst of an already controversial special legislative session, lawmakers have reintroduced a bill that would allow lawsuits to target anyone who manufactures, mails, delivers, prescribes or distributes abortion pills. The bill would also permit people to file a wrongful death lawsuit if the medication results in harm or death of a fetus or the mother, within a statute of limitations up to six years.",
      "\"These are the pills that are being mailed into Texas directly to women, often without instructions, certainly without doctors as before, and without follow-up care after,\" the bill's sponsor, Texas state Sen. Bryan Hughes, a Republican, told the Texas Tribune earlier this year. \"This is illegal in Texas, but is taking place, and we've thus far not been able to protect women.\"",
      "The World Health Organization says the pills \u2014 a combination of mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 can be safely prescribed for women to self-administer at home, without the direct supervision of a health care provider, in the first trimester.",
      "Hughes previously sponsored a state law, passed in 2021, banning abortions at six weeks, or when a \"fetal heartbeat\" is detected.",
      "The new proposal, known as the Women and Child Protection Act, is expected to be heard in committee in the Texas State Senate during Monday's special session. An earlier version stalled in the House during the most recent legislative session.",
      "The bill also seeks to route any challenges into federal court, and includes language aimed at neutralizing the force of so-called shield laws in other states, designed to protect doctors who prescribe abortion medication from states without bans.",
      "\"Texas continues to try to meddle in the provision of safe, legal and affordable reproductive health care nationwide,\" says Julie Kay, the former executive director for the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine. \"Telemedicine abortion is a modern and effective way to provide care.\"",
      "At the same time, former Texas Solicitor General Jonathan Mitchell, who led the push for the state's current abortion restrictions, has announced a lawsuit filed on behalf of a Texas woman who alleges the father of the child she was expecting slipped abortion medication into her hot chocolate, leading her to lose her pregnancy.",
      "Similar to the proposed legislation, this lawsuit targets shield laws in other states meant to protect physicians who provided the abortion pills in the plaintiff's case. The lawsuit is filed in federal court and names a nonprofit group that the plaintiff claims helped the father obtain medication, Aid Access, which is based in the Netherlands.",
      "According to the civil lawsuit, the father \"obtained these drugs from Aid Access, a criminal organization that illegally ships abortion pills into Texas and other jurisdictions where abortion has been outlawed.\"",
      "Aid Access and the father have not been criminally charged.",
      "On its website, Aid Access says it has facilitated over 200,000 online abortions to women in the U.S. since 2018. In some cases, the group relies on telemedicine shield laws, such as ones enacted in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New York, Vermont and Washington, to fulfill orders and mail them to recipients in states with bans.",
      "Aid Access founder Dr. Rebecca Gomperts previously told CBS News the service is legal in all the jurisdictions in which it operates.",
      "\"Where I work from, it's legal to prescribe the medications. And so I'll do that. And the pharmacy that I refer to is allowed to mail the medicines, on a prescription of a doctor, to the women. So (the Texas law) has no impact on what we do,\" Gomperts said.",

    "story": [
      "Wendy's cut its sales outlook Friday, pointing to heightened competition and economic uncertainty weighing on its customer base.",
      "Company executives discussed Wendy's challenges during a call with analysts Friday, following the release of its latest earnings report. Interim CEO Ken Cook said that in light of the current environment, the company now expects full-year global sales to decline between 3% and 5%, compared with previous\u00a0projections\u00a0of flat to down 2%.",
      "Wendy's is coping with softer consumer demand in 2025, particularly among the lower-income customers that tend to frequent fast-food chains, Sara Senatore, a research analyst at Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The low-income consumer remains under pressure,\" she said.",
      "Fast food chains like Wendy's are competing for the attention of low-income consumers who have pulled back on eating out over concerns about the economy. According to a May study from Bankrate, among households earning less than $50,000 per year, 44% say they expect to spend less on dining out this year than they did last year.",
      "Cook, who stepped in as interim CEO after former Wendy's CEO Kirk Tanner departed to lead the Hershey Company, cited \"a combination of dynamic consumer behavior and a more challenging competitive environment\" during a Friday call with analysts to discuss the results.",
      "While sales improved in May and June due to new Frosty offerings, \"overall demand recovered more slowly than we expected,\" he added. The burger chain's sales slipped 1.8% to $3.7 billion in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, according to the company's earnings report.",
      "Inflation-weary consumers who are skipping breakfast could signal this growing pressure, with Wendy's executives highlighting the trend.",
      "\"Breakfast continued to perform worse than rest of day in the second quarter, which makes sense when you look at what's happening from a consumer behavior perspective,\" Cook said. \"When consumer uncertainty increases and consumers choose to eat another meal at home, breakfast is often the first place that they that they do that with.\"",
      "Meanwhile, McDonald's, which last year saw a sales slowdown from low-income consumers, reversed that trend following its decision to\u00a0expand its value menu. CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts earlier in the week that value items \u2014 which include its $2.99 Snack Wrap \u2014 are bringing some consumers back to its stores even as fast food visits across the industry have slowed.",
      "Senatore said Wendy's provides good values for price-conscious consumers, but added the chain may not be communicating that as effectively as its competitors. \"McDonald's has done a good job of marketing value, and that is something that Wendy's acknowledged that they needed to do,\" she said.",
      "Among other value offerings is the Wendy's Biggie Bag, which features a junior bacon cheeseburger, small fries, four-piece chicken nuggets and a soft drink for $5.",
      "Asked about adjusting core menu pricing during Friday's call, Cook said the company plans to use new data analytics capabilities to evaluate its prices.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Monday that he expected to determine mere moments into his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week whether it would be possible to work out a deal to halt the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"At the end of that meeting, probably the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,\" Mr. Trump said at a White House press conference where he announced plans for a federal takeover of Washington's police force to help combat crime.",
      "He said he thought Friday's sitdown with Putin in Alaska would be \"really a feel-out meeting.\" Mr. Trump added that \"it'll be good, but it might be bad\" and predicted he may say, \"lots of luck, keep fighting. Or I may say, we can make a deal.\"",
      "Putin wants to lock in Russia's gains since invading Ukraine in February 2022 as Mr. Trump presses for a ceasefire that has remained out of reach. Mr. Trump's eagerness to reach a deal has raised fears in Ukraine and Europe about such an agreement favoring Russia, without sufficient input from Ukraine. Mr. Trump has alternately harshly criticized both leaders after promising \u2014 and so far failing \u2014 to swiftly end the conflict.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"it is important to see how serious Putin is, and the only one who can do that is President Trump.\"",
      "\"It's really crucial that a meeting takes place. It will not be the final say on this,\" Rutte said. \"Of course, Ukraine will have to be involved in Europe, but it is important to start the next phase of this process, putting pressure on the Russians, exactly as President Trump has been doing over the last six months.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday ducked repeated chances to say that he would push for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to take part in his discussions with Putin, and was especially dismissive of Zelenskyy and his need to be part of an effort to seek peace.",
      "He said the Ukrainian president had been to \"a lot of meetings\" without managing to halt a war that Russia started. Mr. Trump also noted that Zelenskyy had been in power for the duration of the war and said \"nothing happened\" during that time. He contrasted that with Putin, who has wielded power in Russia for decades.",
      "Mr. Trump said that, after his meeting with Putin, \"The next meeting will be with Zelenskyy and Putin\" but it could also be a meeting with \"Putin and Zelenskyy and me.\"",
      "European allies have pushed for Ukraine's involvement, fearful that discussions could otherwise favor Moscow.",
      "To that point, Mr. Trump said he would call Zelenskyy and European leaders after his discussion with Putin to \"tell them what kind of a deal \u2014 I'm not going to make a deal. It's not up to me to make a deal.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spent the early part of his administration decrying Zelenskyy, even suggesting he was a dictator because his country has not held elections during the war. Zelenskyy was hounded out of the Oval Office in February after Mr. Trump and Vice President JD Vance suggested he hadn't been grateful enough for U.S. support.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump has expressed frustration with Putin that Russia hasn't appeared to take a push for a ceasefire more seriously, and softened his tone toward Zelenskyy. His comments Monday suggested he might have had another change of heart.",
      "\"President Putin invited me to get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he thought it was \"very respectful\" that Putin is coming to the U.S. for Friday's meeting, instead of insisting that Mr. Trump go to Russia.",
      "\"I'd like to see a ceasefire. I'd like to see the best deal that can be made for both parties,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president repeated that any major agreement could involve land swaps, without elaborating. He had threatened Moscow with more economic sanctions if more isn't done to work toward a ceasefire, but suggested Monday that, should Friday's meeting be successful, he could see a day when the U.S. and Russia normalize trade relations.",
      "Putin is expected to be unwavering in his demands to keep all the territory his forces now occupy and to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO, with the long-term aim of returning it to Moscow's sphere of influence.",
      "Zelenskyy insists he will never consent to any formal Russian annexation of Ukrainian territory or give up a bid for NATO membership.",
      "Putin believes he has the advantage on the ground as Ukrainian forces struggle to hold back Russian advances along the 600-mile front. On the front lines, few Ukrainian soldiers believe there's an end in sight to the war.",
      "With the Europeans and Ukrainians so far not invited to the summit, Germany sought to prepare by inviting Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy, the NATO chief and several other European leaders for a virtual meeting on Wednesday.",
      "The German chancellery said the talks would seek additional ways to pressure Russia and prepare for peace negotiations and \"related issues of territorial claims and security.\"",
      "Steffen Meyer, spokesperson for German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, said the German government \"has always emphasized that borders must not be shifted by force\" and that Ukraine should decide its own fate \"independently and autonomously.\"",

    "summary": "The government of Niger has launched an investigation into what they call possible \"illicit international trafficking\" after a piece of Mars unearthed in the Sahara Desert was sold.",
    "story": [
      "It's the\u00a0largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth\u00a0\u2014 a 54-pound meteorite that fetched more than $5 million at a New York auction last month, setting a world record.",
      "But in the West African nation of Niger, where the rusty-red rock was unearthed in the Sahara Desert, officials have launched an investigation into what they call possible \"illicit international trafficking,\" claiming it may have been smuggled out of the country. Sotheby's, the auction house, has disputed the claim.",
      "The government of Niger says it has launched an official investigation \"to identify the circumstances of its discovery and sale.\" While the country doesn't have specific legislation regarding meteorites, an international heritage law is being looked into.",
      "Here's what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute:",
      "How the meteorite was found",
      "Sotheby's said the rock, named NWA 16788, was blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike and traveled 140 million miles to Earth.",
      "\"The odds of this getting from there to here are astronomically small,\" Cassandra Hatton, Sotheby's vice chairman of science and natural history, said in an auction house video.",
      "It was discovered in the\u00a0Sahara\u00a0in northwestern Niger by a meteorite hunter in November 2023, according to the auction house. His identity was not disclosed. Nor was the identity of the buyer last month.",
      "Meteorite hunting is growing in arid Saharan countries like Niger. Though meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery in part due to the favorable climate for their preservation.",
      "Hunters often search for space rocks that can be sold to collectors or scientists. The rarest and most precious are from Mars and the moon.",
      "According to the Heritage academic journal, the rock was sold to an international dealer before it ended up in a private gallery in Italy. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said.",
      "The meteorite was also briefly on display in Rome before it was next seen in public in New York last month during the auction. It is the largest meteorite from Mars, but not the largest meteorite ever found. According to\u00a0NASA, a meteorite originally weighing over 100 tons once fell in Namibia.",
      "Why Niger is investigating",
      "Following the sale, Niger raised questions about how the meteorite came to be sold at auction.",
      "Niger's government announced an investigation last month to determine the circumstances of the meteorite's discovery and sale, saying in a statement it was \"akin to illicit international trafficking.\"",
      "Last week, President Abdourahamane Tiani suspended the export of \"precious stones, semi-precious stones and meteorites nationwide\" to ensure their traceability.",
      "Sotheby's, which regularly auctions meteorites, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press that the meteorite was exported from Niger and transported in line with all relevant international procedures.",
      "\"As with everything we sell, all necessary documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved,\" the statement read.",
      "Authorities in Niger did not respond to AP questions.",
      "What international law says",
      "While global agreements are in place to regulate the trade of cultural artifacts, there is ambiguity about whether meteorites are covered.",
      "Patty Gerstenblith, a cultural heritage lawyer and expert on illicit trade, said that under the UNESCO convention on cultural property \u2014 which Niger and the U.S. have ratified \u2014 meteorites can qualify as cultural property.",
      "However, Gerstenblith said Niger needs to prove it owned the meteorite and that it was stolen, as illegal export from the country does not make the meteorite illegal in the U.S.",
      "\"If the meteorite was not stolen and if it was properly declared upon import into the U.S., then it would not seem that Niger can recover the meteorite,\" she told the AP.",
      "Some countries, like Morocco, one of the leading sources of meteorites on the international market, require restitution if the objects are discovered on their territory. But enforcement has been challenging due to the vast desert areas and informal trading networks.",

As he reached the lip of the hole, though, the belt broke, and Bell fell again. He then no longer responded to his friend's calls.",

    "summary": "Australia will recognize a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says, joining the leaders of France, Britain and Canada in signaling they would do so.",
    "story": [
      "Australia will recognize a Palestinian state, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday, joining the leaders of France, Britain and Canada in signaling they would do so.",
      "His remarks followed weeks of urging from within his Cabinet and from many in Australia to recognize a Palestinian state and amid growing criticism from officials in his government over suffering in Gaza, which Albanese on Monday referred to as a \"humanitarian catastrophe.\"",
      "Australia's government has also criticized plans announced in recent days by Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu for a sweeping new military offensive in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu on Sunday defended the offensive \u2014 which is more sweeping than previously announced \u2014 declaring in the face of growing condemnation at home and abroad that Israel \"has no choice but to finish the job and complete the defeat of Hamas.\"",
      "Netanyahu said the security Cabinet last week instructed the dismantling of Hamas strongholds not only in Gaza City but also in the \"central camps\" and Muwasi. A source familiar with the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, confirmed to The Associated Press that Israel plans it in both areas.",
      "The camps \u2014 sheltering well over a half-million displaced people, according to the U.N. \u2014 had not been part of Israel's earlier announcement. It was not clear why, though Netanyahu faced criticism this weekend within his ruling coalition that targeting Gaza City was not enough. Netanyahu said there would be \"safe zones,\" but such designated areas have been bombed in the past.",
      "Albanese told reporters after a Cabinet meeting Monday that Australia's decision to recognize a Palestinian state will be formalized at the United Nations General Assembly in September. The acknowledgement was \"predicated on commitments Australia has received from the Palestinian Authority,\" Albanese said.",
      "Those commitments included no role for Hamas in a Palestinian government, demilitarization of Gaza and the holding of elections, he said.",
      "\"A two-state solution is humanity's best hope to break the cycle of violence in the Middle East and to bring an end to the conflict, suffering and starvation in Gaza,\" Albanese said.",
      "\"The situation in Gaza has gone beyond the world's worst fears,\" he said. \"The Israeli government continues to defy international law and deny sufficient aid, food and water to desperate people, including children.\"",
      "\"Until Israeli and Palestinian statehood is permanent, peace can only be temporary,\" he said. \"Australia will recognize the right of the Palestinian people to a state of their own. We will work with the international community to make this right a reality.\"",
      "The Israel-Hamas war, raging in Gaza since the Palestinian militant group's attack on Israel Oct. 7, 2023, has revived global momentum toward a Palestinian state.  Ahead of Albanese's announcement, Netanyahu on Sunday criticized Australia and other European countries that have moved in that direction.",
      "\"To have European countries and Australia march into that rabbit hole ... this canard, is disappointing and I think it's actually shameful,\" the Israeli leader said.",
      "Australia has designated Hamas a terrorist entity and Albanese repeated Monday his government's calls for the group to return Israeli hostages held since the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "The Australian leader last week spoke to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, whose authority administers parts of the occupied West Bank, supports a two-state solution and cooperates with Israel on security matters. Abbas has agreed to conditions with Western leaders, including Albanese, as they prepared to recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "\"This is an opportunity to deliver self-determination for the people of Palestine in a way isolates Hamas, disarms it and drives it out of the region once and for all,\" Albanese said. He added that Hamas did not support a two-state solution.",
      "Nearly 150 of the 193 members of the United Nations have already recognized Palestinian statehood, most of them decades ago. The United States and other Western powers have held off, saying Palestinian statehood should be part of a final agreement resolving the decades-old Middle East conflict.",
      "Recognition announcements are largely symbolic and are rejected by Israel.",
      "A two-state solution would see a state of Palestine created alongside Israel in most or all of the occupied West Bank, the war-ravaged Gaza Strip and annexed east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war that the Palestinians want for their state.",
      "Albanese dismissed suggestions Monday that the move was solely symbolic.",
      "\"This is a practical contribution towards building momentum,\" he said. \"This is not Australia acting alone.\"",
      "Albanese had discussed Australia's decision with the leaders of Britain, France, New Zealand and Japan, he said. He also had a \"long discussion\" with Netanyahu this month, he added.",
      "In neighboring New Zealand, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Monday his government \"will carefully weigh up its position\" on recognizing a Palestinian state before making a formal decision in September.",
      "\"New Zealand has been clear for some time that our recognition of a Palestinian state is a matter of when, not if,\" Peters said in a statement.",
      "Differing reactions to Albanese's announcement",
      "After Albanese's announcement Monday, Israel's envoy to Australia said the move undermined Israel's security.",
      "\"By recognizing a Palestinian state now, Australia elevates the position of Hamas, a group it acknowledges as a terrorist organization,\" Amir Maimon posted to X.",
      "\"This commitment removes any incentive or diplomatic pressure for the Palestinians to do the things that have always stood in the way of ending the conflict,\" spokesperson for the Executive Council of the Australian Jewry Alex Ryvchin said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, President of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network Nasser Mashni decried Albanese's recognition as too late and \"completely meaningless\" while the country continues to trade with Israel.",
      "He told reporters in Melbourne on Monday that the move would do nothing to end the \"ongoing genocide in Gaza which has been live streamed for the entire world for two years.\"",

      "Zelenskyy thanked the Europeans for their statement, saying in a post on X\u00a0that he is \"grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine.\" The Ukrainian president\u00a0previously brushed off the planned Putin-Trump summit, writing that any peace deal that excludes Ukraine \"will never work.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance met Saturday with top European and Ukrainian officials at the British Foreign Secretary's weekend residence to discuss how to end the war.",
      "The Trump-Putin meeting may prove pivotal in a war that began when Russia invaded its western neighbor and has led to tens of thousands of deaths, although there's no guarantee it will stop the fighting since Moscow and Kyiv remain far apart on their conditions for peace.",
      "A monthlong U.S.-led push to achieve a truce in Ukraine has so far proved fruitless, with Kyiv agreeing in principle while Moscow has held out for terms more to its liking.",
      "Mr. Trump had also moved up an ultimatum to impose additional sanctions on Russia and introduce secondary tariffs targeting countries that buy Russian oil if the Kremlin did not move toward a settlement. The deadline was Friday. The White House did not answer questions on Saturday about possible sanctions.",
      "The Kremlin earlier this week reiterated demands that Ukraine give up territory, abandon its bid to join NATO and accept limits on its military, in exchange for a withdrawal of Russian troops from the rest of the country.",

      "Ukrainian officials previously told the Associated Press privately that Kyiv would be amenable to a peace deal that would de facto recognize Ukraine's inability to regain lost territories militarily. But Zelenskyy on Saturday insisted that formally ceding land was out of the question.",

    "summary": "London police said Sunday that 532 people were arrested the previous day when supporters of a pro-Palestinian group that was recently outlawed as a terrorist organization intentionally broke the law.",
    "story": [
      "Several hundred people marched in London on Sunday to demand Hamas release the Israeli hostages held by the Palestinian militant group in Gaza, criticizing Britain's plan to recognize Palestine as a state, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "Joined by several relatives of the hostages, the march ended at the 10 Downing Street office of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has said the U.K. will recognize a Palestinian state if Israel does not agree to a truce in its war with Hamas.",
      "Many of the protesters waved Israeli flags or wore yellow ribbons, a symbol of solidarity with the hostages, whose liberation the organizers of the march argue should be the Labour leader's priority.",
      "Among those who attended the rally Sunday is Noga Guttman, a cousin of 24-year-old hostage\u00a0Evyatar David, who was featured in a video that enraged Israelis when it was released by Hamas militants last week. The video showed an emaciated David saying he is digging his own grave inside a tunnel in Gaza.",
      "Ayelet Stavitsky, sister of dead hostage Nadav Popplewell, and Adam Ma'anit, cousin of Tsachi Idan, who died while held by Hamas, also were in attendance, according to AFP.",
      "Hamas-led militants kidnapped 251 people when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Some 50 of the hostages still haven't been released, of whom 20 are thought to be alive.",
      "\"I think that the government got it wrong with its foreign policy, that it's time for it to correct and refocus on the hostages,\" said Ma'anit, criticising Starmer's planned recognition of a Palestinian state in September.",
      "Three people, identified as counter-protesters, were arrested, two of them for alleged violent acts, police said.",
      "Sunday's march came a day after\u00a0supporters of a pro-Palestinian group\u00a0that was recently outlawed as a terrorist organization intentionally broke the law to test the government's ability to enforce the ban. London police said that 532 people were arrested Saturday.",
      "The vast majority of those detained were arrested for displaying placards declaring their support for the group known as Palestine Action. Police updated their earlier totals and said 522 people were arrested for supporting a proscribed organization in violation of anti-terror laws. Another 10 people were arrested on a variety of charges, including assaulting and obstructing police officers.",
      "Police said that was the highest number of arrests made on a single day in the last 10 years, CBS News partner\u00a0BBC News reported.",
      "Backers of Palestine Action staged the protest to underscore their belief that the government is illegally restricting freedom of expression by banning a direct action organization that has challenged its policies.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who oversees law enforcement in Britain, rejected that characterization, saying Palestine Action was banned after committing serious attacks involving violence, significant injuries and extensive criminal damage.",
      "\"The right to protest is one we protect fiercely but this is very different from displaying support for this one specific and narrow, proscribed organization,\" Cooper said in a statement. \"Many people may not yet know the reality of this organization, but the assessments are very clear, this is not a nonviolent organization,\" she added.",
      "The government banned Palestine Action after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base and damaged two tanker planes to protest British support for the war in Gaza. Palestine Action had previously targeted Israeli defense contractors and other sites in Britain that they believe have links with the Israeli military.",
      "Supporters of Palestine Action are challenging the ban in court, saying the government has gone too far in declaring a direct action group a terrorist organization.",
      "Israel last week announced its intention to occupy Gaza City as part of a plan to end the war and bring the captives home. Family members and many international leaders have condemned the plan, saying it would lead to more bloodshed and endanger the hostages.",
      "United Nations Human Rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk and U.K. Prime Minister Starmer were among them. T\u00fcrk, in a statement issued after Israel's announcement, said the government's \"plan for a complete military takeover of the occupied Gaza strip must be immediately halted.\" He added that \"further escalation will result in more massive forced displacement, more killing, more unbearable suffering, senseless destruction and atrocity crimes.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Starmer called Israel's plan \"wrong\" and said it would \"do nothing to bring an end to this conflict or to help secure the release of the hostages.\"",
      "Stop the Hate, a coalition of groups organizing the march through London on Sunday, said in a statement that they \"are united in one clear and urgent demand: the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.\"",
      "\"Regardless of our diverse political views, this is not a political issue \u2014 it is a human one,\" the coalition said.",

About 1,400 firefighters were deployed Saturday in France's southern Aude region to prevent it from reigniting, the Associated Press reported. High temperatures in the coming days are expected to complicate firefighters' efforts.",

    "story": [
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Sunday that President Trump will be \"testing\" Russian President Vladimir Putin in their landmark face-to-face\u00a0meeting set for Friday, as world leaders push for a ceasefire deal in Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "\"On Friday, it is important to see how serious Putin is, and the only one who can do that is President Trump,\" Rutte said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced the \"highly anticipated\" summit with Putin in a post on Truth Social late last week, saying the leaders are set to meet Friday in Alaska.",
      "The U.S. president had expressed frustration with Putin in recent weeks, as Russia pounded Ukraine with drone and missile attacks, including what Ukraine described as the largest such attacks since the invasion began in February 2022. Then last week, the tide within the administration appeared to turn, as Mr. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin in Moscow, and the two countries began suggesting openness to a meeting between the two presidents.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters late last week that Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy want \"to see peace.\" And although the White House had indicated earlier in the week that Mr. Trump is open to meeting with both Putin and Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump said that he plans to \"start off with Russia,\" while adding that \"we have a shot at\" convening a trilateral meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy. Two sources told CBS News Saturday that Mr. Trump is still willing to meet jointly with Zelenskyy and Putin, but the meeting currently remains bilateral, as Putin requested.",
      "Rutte, asked whether he's comfortable with Ukraine being excluded from these negotiations on Friday, said when it comes to discussion of territory, security guarantees, peace talks and what happens next, \"Ukraine will have to be \u2014 and will be \u2014 involved.\"",
      "\"It's really crucial that a meeting takes place. It will not be the final say on this,\" Rutte said. \"Of course, Ukraine will have to be involved in Europe, but it is important to start the next phase of this process, putting pressure on the Russians, exactly as President Trump has been doing over the last six months.\"",
      "Rutte argued that Mr. Trump \"basically broke the deadlock\" by starting a dialogue with Putin earlier this year, calling it a \"crucial\" development.",
      "He generally lauded Mr. Trump's strategy. Rutte touted a \"great NATO Summit\" under the U.S. president's leadership, with commitments for each member state to raise defense spending to 5% of their GDP, in a sign to Russia that \"we are serious.\" And Rutte credited Mr. Trump for allowing U.S.\u00a0weapons to be delivered into Ukraine, which he said \"opened the floodgates,\" while lauding the planned secondary sanctions on some of the biggest buyers of Russian oil and gas, including India.",
      "The secretary general said NATO-coordinated weapons deliveries will continue regardless of what happens at the Friday summit, emphasizing its commitment to \"making sure that Ukraine has what it needs to stay in the fight and be in the best possible position\" when the time comes for negotiations for a ceasefire or peace deal.",
      "On the possibility of those negotiations beginning, Rutte said Friday's meeting \"is President Trump making sure that Putin is serious.\"",
      "\"If he is not, then it will stop there,\" Rutte said. \"If he is serious, then from Friday onwards, the process will continue \u2014 Ukraine getting involved, the Europeans being involved.\"",
      "It remains unclear what form an eventual ceasefire or peace deal could take, as Russia has demanded that Ukraine cede the parts of eastern Ukraine that are occupied by Russian troops \u2014 which Ukraine has rejected. Mr. Trump said last week any deal will likely involve \"some swapping of territories.\"",
      "Rutte said Sunday that Russia's control over Ukrainian territory can never be accepted \"in a legal sense,\" but negotiations could cover \"how to deal with the factual situation that the Russians are holding, at this moment, Ukrainian territory.\"",
      "Ukraine's Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, and said that \"all Ukraine prays for President Trump to be effective and to have great results.\"",
      "\"We want Putin to stop,\" Markarova said. \"And we really are hopeful that this push from President Trump and the sanction packages which are on the table and secondary sanctions which are already implemented against those who help Russia will convince President Putin that this is time for him to finally stop his aggression.\"",
      "Markarova said Zelenskyy is willing to participate in future meetings as needed, but didn't criticize the fact that the Alaska meeting will only feature the U.S. and Russian leaders, saying, \"sometimes diplomacy requires different formats.\"",
      "Still, others have expressed concern about the planned meeting between Mr. Trump and Putin. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, said, \"I hope we got something out of this,\" saying the administration \"should have extracted something for this visit.\"",
      "\"Putin is a war criminal,\" Kelly said. \"This is not a show of strength to allow him to fly into the United States, to land here, to negotiate with our president.\"",

      "\"I truly believe for us \u2013 and this is again is what's worked for us \u2013 is just having a foundation,\" Murray, who shares three children with wife, Sarah Roemer, told Fox News Digital in 2024.",
      "\"You have to have a strong foundation to know that there's consequence for your action in life. And with God, we've been able to really have that,\" he continued. \"We don't walk around living in a bubble by any means. But we very much just love big, love strong. We love everybody. That's how we go through our life every day, just trying to live as we feel we should, right? Through love. And so, by putting God and family first, we tie that all up. It helps us make every other decision that we make in our life.\"",
      "\"It helps keep you out of bad situations,\" he added. \"By saying, 'You know what, this probably is not a good idea. Let's not go there.' Right? So I don't end up in places I shouldn't be; we don't end up in places we shouldn't be. We make good decisions. It could be something as simple as walking into a grocery store and someone's in a bad, foul mood. The response you could have would be to match that \u2026 and then it could become something you don't want to deal with. Or you try to match it with love and all of a sudden the simplest gesture, you know, changes someone's day.\"",

      "\"You know, I could always go back to a career, but I couldn't go back to my children,\" Lebrock added. \"And that was the most important thing to me was raising my children, because I grew up in boarding school. At five [years old], I was sent away. And I didn't want to have that story for my children.\"",
      "The New York native, who was also raised in London, and Seagal are parents to daughter Annaliza, 38, son Dominic, 35, and daughter Arissa, 32.

      "\"I have a bevy of animals, which is what I was doing,\" she said. \"I was taking care of the chickens and the sheep and the goats and the horses and the dogs and the cats.\"",
      "\"So, I really ran away,\" LeBrock said. \"I mean, the hardest thing for me is not putting on makeup or trying to look nice. It's trying to get those chin hairs out of my chin. And it's a whole new world. What can I say? But I'm excited about my future. I'm developing a Kelly Care product, which is going to help people with their wounds for their pets and grooming. And I'm excited about that, but not interested in Hollywood.\"",
      "While LeBrock noted that it was her divorce from Seagal that prompted her exit from Hollywood, she explained that she really never felt comfortable in the industry.",
      "\"The crowd is very ugly, and I didn't want any part of that,\" she said. \"I'm really quite shy, and I'm a homebody. I spent the two years of COVID completely by myself, pretty much in the wilderness. And you learn a lot about yourself when you're not in the noise.\"",

      "LeBrock was one of the industry's top models in the 1970s before embarking on her acting career. Shortly after her star-making turn in \"Weird Science,\" LeBrock became the face of a beauty campaign for the Pantene haircare line and famously appeared in a shampoo commercial in which she delivered the now-iconic line \"Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.\"",
      "In a 2012 interview with Allure magazine, LeBrock recalled that she was initially uncomfortable with saying the line and almost left the audition.",
      "\"I used to be so insecure and self-conscious that if anybody even looked at me, I'd go red,\" LeBrock told the outlet. \"So even though it was obviously tongue-in-cheek, it was really difficult to say, 'Don't hate me because I'm beautiful.'\"",
      "During her interview with Fox News Digital, LeBrock explained that she has gained more confidence as she has aged.",
      "\"I never thought I was beautiful,\" she shared. \"I feel more beautiful now than I did then. And that's sad. Youth is wasted on the young, that's for sure.\"",

      "\"I grew up in a very isolated area, the five, six years of my life, playing in fields and unattended by parents,\" she recalled. \"And that saved my soul. I think when you can be in nature and be without people, then you get to know yourself, and you're comfortable.\"",
      "However, LeBrock explained that ranch life was not without its perils.",
      "\"There's mountain lions and big rattlesnakes and tarantulas and bears, but the lions are big,\" she said. \"And the last time I saw one, I ran home on my horse, and I haven't been down to that area since, because they're pretty big.\"",

      "\"I'm really sad for our society,\" she said. \"You go into an airport, you go into a restaurant, nobody's talking. They're all on their phones. It's like a sickness. It's like a drug. And I don't want any part of that. It's just confusing to me.\"",

      "U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) delivers a statement on the Israeli museum shooting that left two Israeli Embassy staffers dead after holding a press conference on the House passage of the tax and spending bill, at the U.S. Capitol on May 22, 2025 in Washington, DC.\u00a0 (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)",
      "At the last minute, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced he would help Republicans crack the filibuster. Schumer didn\u2019t vote yes on the bill itself. But the New York Democrat argued that avoiding a shutdown at that point was better than enduring one under President Trump \u2013 and Elon Musk who was then fully empowered at DOGE.Some longtime Capitol Hill hands and Congressional observers feared the government might shutter for a lengthy period if it closed. Schumer and other Democrats asserted that the President and Musk would use that as justification for never re-opening some parts of the government since they lacked funding from Congress.Progressives excoriated Schumer for not extracting a major concession from President Trump and Congressional Republicans which reflected Democratic values and priorities. Liberals used Schumer\u2019s decision as justification to demand new Democratic leadership in the Senate. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., appeared to seethe at Schumer\u2019s maneuver, sidestepping questions from reporters about the break.White House Budget Director Russ Vought says he wants a less bipartisan appropriations process. That\u2019s fine. But this is about the math. House Republicans must stick together to pass any spending package there. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can only lose three votes and still pass a bill without Democratic assistance. Likewise, Senate Republicans can only lose three votes there, too. But the real hurdle is the filibuster. That\u2019s where 60 votes are necessary. And that means the GOP must lean on Democrats \u2013 assuming they\u2019re willing to help out.",
      "HILLARY RIPPED AS 'MASSIVE LIAR' AFTER SCATHING REACTION TO TRUMP'S PLAN TO FIX DC CRIMEIt's really unclear if Republicans can stick together to approve a spending package. Keep in mind that it\u2019s almost a certainty that any spending measure must simply renew all current funding on a temporary basis. A lot of Republicans are fed up with this appropriations rut \u2013 especially since Johnson promised to do things differently once he claimed the Speaker\u2019s gavel in October 2023. Remember that some conservatives helped bounce former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., less than two years ago because he propounded an interim spending plan.\u00a0Some Republicans are beginning to lose patience with Johnson on spending plans. But remember that most Republicans will support whatever appropriations plan the GOP brass concocts \u2013 as long as it has the blessing of President Trump.",

      "So Vought may advocate for a more partisan process. But that won\u2019t result in policy achievements and GOP spending priorities unless Republicans convince Democrats to play ball.\u00a0Here\u2019s another dynamic: some members of the conservative Freedom Caucus are hinting they simply want to re-up the current levels of funding again. Yes, lawmakers approved those spending plans under President Biden and a Democratic Senate. Therefore, much of the federal government is still operating under Democratic spending blueprints. But Democrats would demand more money for the next spending round. The same with some Republicans. So voting to renew the old money \u2013 regardless of who pushed for it \u2013 is less than Congress could have spent. That\u2019s why some Freedom Caucus members suggest this would serve as a de facto spending cut.They\u2019re not wrong. Federal spending is almost always on an upward trajectory. This would level things off and bend the annual spending curve for the first time in decades.",
      "TRUMP FIRES BACK AT 'SQUAD' MEMBER WHO CALLED HIM A 'PIECE OF S---' AT RALLYSo, if your goal is to trim funding, this may be the most plausible option under the present political circumstances.Remember, it\u2019s about the math.\u00a0Moreover, Republicans have only approved a pittance of the funding cuts demanded by DOGE. Congress passed a bill to slash $9 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and foreign aid. That\u2019s not a lot. And Republicans could barely approve that bill. How they rescind other funding remains to be seen. However, Republicans could greenlight all the old money \u2013 and then promise budget hawks they will attempt to claw back other tranches of spending through future recissions packages later in the fall or winter.",

      "But Democrats won\u2019t go for that. They\u2019d view that as Republicans dropping a Hershey\u2019s bar in their trick or treat bag \u2013 and then exchanging it for a rock.It\u2019s unclear if Democrats have explored soaping the Republicans\u2019 windows at the Capitol this fall if Republicans attempt that gambit. But this could be a chance to find out.\u00a0That brings us to the conundrum facing Schumer. One might question how the politics have changed since March \u2013 although President Trump and Musk are no longer in league with one another. But progressives will expect Schumer to demand a king\u2019s ransom in exchange for Democratic votes breaking a filibuster.\u00a0In other words, both Johnson and Schumer face decisions of frightening proportions very soon.\u00a0It may seem as though October 1 is a long way down the calendar. It\u2019s not. To ignore how complicated this may become is the legislative equivalent of whistling past the graveyard.",

How many New Yorkers would be evicted from their apartments? How many New Yorkers would have their lives upended by a former governor who is responding to the fact that he was handily beaten by a tenant of a rent-stabilized apartment?\" Mamdani asked.",

      "The fight between President Donald Trump and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom over the National Guard's presence in California is coming to a head on Monday in the start of a three-day trial.",
      "Government attorneys are set to argue that Trump had legal authority to deploy roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles in June to assist with anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests and riots.",
      "While most of the National Guard members have since been demobilized, the trial could set the stage for more fights across the country as Trump federalizes guard members in Washington, D.C., and threatens to do so elsewhere in response to high crime rates in blue cities.",

      "National Guard troops are deployed around downtown Los Angeles, June 8, 2025, following an immigration raid protest the night before. (AP Photo/Eric Thayer)",
      "Breyer previously granted a temporary restraining order in favor of Newsom, saying Trump's decision to mobilize the National Guard was illegal because it infringed on California's authority. One of the conditions required under the law Trump cited to federalize the National Guard is that a rebellion must be underway, and Breyer said the riots in California fell far short of that scenario.",
      "But Breyer's decision was quickly reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A three-judge panel for the appellate court unanimously found that the courts have limited ability to review whether a president has properly invoked the law to federalize the National Guard.",
      "\"We are persuaded that, under longstanding precedent interpreting the statutory predecessor to \u00a712406, our review of that decision must be highly deferential,\" the panel wrote. \"Affording the President that deference, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority under \u00a712406(3), which authorizes federalization of the National Guard when \u2018the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\u2019\"",
      "The panel paused Breyer's initial order indefinitely, but Monday's trial is the next step in the court process as the judge weighs the merits of the case.",

      "While little is left on the ground in California for the judge to resolve \u2013 Newsom recently announced that about 300 of Trump's deployed National Guard members remain active in the state \u2013 legal questions surrounding Trump's actions persist.",
      "As part of the trial, Breyer will examine the 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from being used for civil matters. Newsom has argued Trump violated that law and plans to call military officials as witnesses during the trial to testify about the directions the National Guard and a few hundred Marines received.",

      "The panel found that while the law's language, which states that Trump must go \"through\" the governor, could mean the president committed a \"procedural\" violation, it did not warrant restricting Trump's use of the military.",
      "Newsom has claimed more broadly that militarizing California was unnecessary and caused the unrest in Los Angeles to intensify.",

The breach occurred on July 16 and involved the compromise of data belonging not just to customers, but also financial professionals and some employees.",

      "According to Allianz, the attacker used a social engineering technique to break in, though the company did not disclose further details. Social engineering attacks typically involve tricking employees into revealing passwords or installing malicious software that gives attackers access to internal systems.",
      "Allianz said it\u00a0\"took immediate action to contain and mitigate the issue\" and has notified federal law enforcement, including the FBI. The company added that there is \"no evidence that the Allianz Life network or other company systems were accessed, including our policy administration system.\"",

      "What personal data was exposed",
      "Allianz did not specify what kind of customer data was taken, but life insurance providers often store highly sensitive information such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and financial details.",

      "Allianz said its investigation remains ongoing and that it has begun reaching out to those affected, offering support through dedicated resources.",

      "After a data breach, attackers often follow up with phishing emails or phone calls. They pretend to be from your insurance company or a support service. Don't click on links in unsolicited messages and verify any claims through official channels before responding. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Unlimited Tomorrow is making 3D-printed prosthetics available for under $8,000 and doing it without sacrificing quality, comfort or functionality. Easton LaChappelle founded the company in 2014 at the age of 18.",

      "$5,900 UNITREE R1 ROBOT IS SURPRISINGLY AFFORDABLE",
      "People wearing the TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "How TrueLimb sets itself apart from other bionic arms",
      "TrueLimb is a full-arm prosthetic solution designed to feel more like an extension of the body than a mechanical device. Each arm is personalized to match the user's opposing limb, down to fingertip size and skin tone. A wide range of color options are available, including natural shades, jet black and metallic silver.",
      "Instead of relying on standard sizes, TrueLimb is custom-built using a remote 3D scanning system. This digital process eliminates the need for in-person fittings and allows for precise, individualized design. The socket is breathable, adjustable and crafted for all-day wear. A built-in BOA dial lets users fine-tune the fit with ease. At just 1.0 to 1.5 pounds from socket to fingertip, the prosthetic remains lightweight and comfortable.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Smart sensors power intuitive, muscle-based control",
      "TrueLimb features TrueSense technology, which includes over 30 topographical sensors embedded within the socket. These sensors detect subtle muscle movements on the residual limb, delivering accurate and responsive control, even when the limb is covered or sweating.",
      "While often referred to as \"mind-controlled,\" TrueLimb does not read brain signals directly. Instead, it uses advanced sensors to pick up electrical activity from muscles in the residual limb. These signals reflect the user\u2019s intended movements, allowing the prosthetic to respond in real time, creating a seamless, intuitive experience that feels like second nature.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The system adapts automatically by identifying the most active myo sites, deactivating less useful sensors and fine-tuning responsiveness based on the user's signal strength. This ensures consistent performance, even if muscle activity changes over time.",
      "The prosthetic includes six intuitive grip patterns to support a wide range of daily activities. Independent finger joints allow the hand to wrap around objects naturally, offering both strength and flexibility. The device is precise enough to handle delicate tasks, such as lifting an egg without cracking it.",
      "TrueLimb, a 3D-printed prosthetic\u00a0 (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "Feel touch again with haptic feedback technology",
      "Beyond movement, TrueLimb gives the user back a sense of touch. Gentle vibrations provide feedback when the prosthetic hand makes contact with objects. This helps users operate the device without always needing to look down, making actions more fluid and natural. The thumb is manually opposable, giving the user better control over grip force and object handling. Whether opening a bottle or holding a pen, the motion feels smooth and confident.",
      "Built for daily life with durable, lightweight materials",
      "TrueLimb is made with PA12 nylon, a highly durable material used in industrial-grade applications. The entire arm is built to withstand daily life. It's splash-resistant, heat-resistant, stain-resistant and tough enough to handle impact or abrasion. Thanks to its rubberized palm and coated fingertips, the hand maintains a firm grip on smooth or slippery surfaces. And with bionic strength, it can lift objects up to 15 pounds with ease.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Fast charging and multi-day battery life",
      "Power won't hold the user back. TrueLimb uses a USB-C charger, the same kind used for most phones and laptops, so no special adapter is needed. A high-capacity 5600mAh battery provides multi-day life, giving freedom to move without frequent recharges. The device also receives over-the-air software updates, so performance improves over time without needing to return the device. Behind the scenes, analytics tools help optimize each arm's performance based on how it's being used.",
      "How TrueLimb is designed and delivered from home",
      "One of the most innovative parts of the TrueLimb process is how it reaches users. Everything happens remotely. Users receive a 3D scanner in the mail to capture the shape of their limb. The data goes directly to the Unlimited Tomorrow team, which builds the prosthetic in-house. This approach eliminates middlemen and dramatically speeds up delivery. Users typically receive their completed prosthetic within weeks.",
      "TrueLimb is pictured in the box in which it was delivered. (Unlimited Tomorrow)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you or a loved one needs a prosthetic arm, this technology changes everything. You no longer need to wait months, file insurance claims or attend repeated fittings. With TrueLimb, you get a high-tech, customized solution faster and at a lower cost. You also gain full control and comfort. The sensors respond to your muscle signals without any lag. The arm fits your body, looks natural and feels like part of you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Unlimited Tomorrow is revolutionizing prosthetics with TrueLimb. This device combines 3D printing, smart sensors and remote support to deliver a user-friendly solution. It's lightweight, strong, affordable and customizable. Most importantly, it brings freedom and functionality back to people who need it. TrueLimb proves that cutting-edge technology can be both personal and practical.",

      "A man checking his emails on his laptop.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why these retirement scams feel so real",
      "Scammers now buy your personal data from data brokers to craft convincing offers. If you're in your 50s or 60s, you're a prime target. They know your age, homeownership status, estimated net worth and even retirement timeline. They don't guess, they know. Your information is being sold across hundreds of websites, and thousands of people can access it. Curious about how exposed you are?",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "What is a \"pre-qualified\" retirement scam?",
      "These scams mimic real communications from financial institutions. You might get a letter or call claiming you're approved for a new investment or annuity opportunity. Scammers often use financial buzzwords like \"IRA consolidation\" or \"required minimum distribution guidance.\" The goal? To make you feel like you're dealing with a trusted expert. They create fake advisor profiles, complete with headshots, license numbers and U.S. contact info. Many even add logos or branding from familiar banks to boost credibility. But once you respond, they'll ask for private financial info or, worse, get you to transfer funds directly into their accounts.",

You could appear on lists labeled \"Retirees with $250k+ Net Worth\" or \"Homeowners Nearing Retirement.\" It's disturbingly precise. Some brokers scrape public records, while others buy data from loyalty cards, surveys or sweepstakes. Bottom line: this happens quietly, behind your back.",
      "The financial toll of these scams",
      "In 2024, the FBI reported that seniors lost over $4.8 billion to scams, a record high. Retirement-related fraud was a major part of that. Once your money is gone, it's usually gone for good. Even if the scammer misled you, your bank may not cover the loss if you authorized the transaction. These scams drain more than just savings. They create lasting stress, fear and shame.

    "story": [
      "WEHEAD connects to ChatGPT and displays a face, expressions and voice.",
      "Artificial intelligence is no longer just a tool for homework or simple tasks. Today, many teens use AI-powered companions for emotional support, advice and even simulated relationships. These apps simulate conversation in ways that feel deeply personal and, for some teens, deeply real.",
      "Recent survey data shows that nearly three-quarters of teens aged 13 to 17 have tried a digital companion at least once, and more than half continue to use them regularly. About one in eight say they use these tools daily, often to talk about personal challenges, vent feelings or practice social interaction.",

      "A man using ChatGPT on his laptop",
      "Why teens are turning to AI companions for support",
      "Teens are drawn to these platforms for several reasons. They are always available, they listen without judgment and they never push back. Because of this, many teens who feel lonely or anxious find them easier to talk to than real people.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "One-third of teens say they have chosen to speak with AI instead of a real person during a serious moment. Of those teens, 31% report finding those conversations equally or more satisfying than talking with a peer. While most teens still spend more time with real-life friends, a small but growing number prefer the control and predictability of digital interaction.",

      "Emotional risks and safety concerns of using AI companions",
      "As the use of AI companions grows, so do concerns from researchers and child development experts. Many of these platforms marketed to teens have weak age verification, no effective content moderation and limited tools for identifying signs of crisis.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Investigations have found instances of inappropriate content, sexualized role play and harmful advice being delivered to young users. In some cases, AI companions have failed to flag signs of mental health struggles or issues that could worsen emotional distress.",
      "Experts warn that this reliance on agreeable, overly affirming digital companions may hinder emotional growth. Teens may miss the opportunity to build real-life empathy, navigate disagreements or learn the give-and-take of human connection.",

      "How technology is reshaping teen relationships",
      "The influence of digital relationships is extending beyond casual conversation. In one industry study, over 80% of Gen Z respondents said they would consider marrying AI in the future. Many also believe these tools are capable of forming deep emotional bonds, beyond just light or casual interactions.",
      "These shifts are raising new questions about how teens define relationships and what they expect from others. If AI friends become a primary model for connection, some worry it could reshape how young people approach trust, intimacy and emotional resilience.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're a parent, teacher or mentor, it's important to understand what's drawing teens to AI companions and how to talk about it. Here are five tips to get you started:",
      "1. Start the conversation: Ask open-ended questions without judgment. Teens are more likely to share when they feel safe and understood.",
      "2. Don't dismiss it: These tools may feel strange to adults, but they often fill real emotional gaps for teens. Acknowledge their value while setting healthy boundaries.",
      "3. Set digital guidelines: Discuss privacy, safety and what to do if an AI ever gives advice that feels off or makes them uncomfortable.",
      "4. Stay informed: Monitor which apps your teen uses and how often. Some offer parental settings or usage insights.",
      "5. Encourage real-world connection: Promote activities that build empathy, cooperation and communication, things AI can't truly offer.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Teens are building real emotional bonds with AI. While these digital companions can offer comfort and a sense of control, they also carry significant psychological and developmental risks.",
      "The technology is moving fast, but support systems and safeguards have not kept pace. Parents and educators should stay aware, ask questions and help teens navigate a world where emotional connections no longer require another human.",

      "How an early sketch inspired The Nest's iconic design",
      "During early design discussions, Daria Sheina skimmed past a rough sketch of two rotated cuboid volumes, thinking it wasn't fully developed. But her clients, Sean Sikorski and Chadd Andre, immediately paused on it, drawn to its bold simplicity. Their reaction sparked what would become the defining form of The Nest \u2014 two interlocked geometric shapes, rotated and stacked like modern building blocks carved out of wood.",
      "Off-grid design tailored for Keats Island's rugged terrain",
      "The Nest was carefully designed for the rugged terrain of Keats Island. With no road access, every construction decision had to account for tricky logistics. In collaboration with BC Passive House, the components were prefabricated to exact weights and dimensions.",
      "Once on site, a helicopter airlifted them to the build location like a life-sized puzzle coming together midair. Inside, the three-story structure opens up with a minimalist design. Exposed wood, green Marmoleum floors and large sliding doors keep the space connected to nature. The cabin includes an open-concept first floor with a living area, kitchen and bathroom, while the upper levels house cozy bedrooms.",

      "Why The Nest off-grid retreat lives up to its name",

Rather than a sprawling footprint, the design centers around circular movement, thoughtful flow and a deep connection to place. Inside, expansive glass frames moss-covered trees and sweeping views of Howe Sound, creating the feeling that the entire island is yours.",

      "Electric vehicles often grab headlines for innovation, but they rarely get credit for affordability. That's where Chinese automaker BYD is flipping the script.",
      "The company introduced the Atto 1 at the Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show, and it's turning heads for all the right reasons. Priced at around $12,000, this fully electric hatchback offers modern features, urban-ready performance, and a price tag that could finally bring EVs to the masses.",

      "Exterior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",
      "Atto 1's features and affordable EV performance",
      "The Atto 1 may fall into the budget category, but it delivers solid specs for city driving. It produces 55 kilowatts, or about 75 horsepower, along with 100 pound-feet of torque. Its top speed is 80 miles per hour, and it accelerates from zero to 30 miles per hour in just under five seconds. These numbers won't blow anyone away at the track, but they hit the sweet spot for daily use.",
      "The standard version comes with a 30.08-kilowatt-hour Blade battery, which gives the car a range of up to 186 miles under the NEDC testing cycle. Drivers looking for a bit more distance can opt for the long-range model. That version features a 38.88-kilowatt-hour battery and extends the range to about 236 miles. Even with the larger battery, the car remains affordable at roughly $14,500.",
      "Charging the Atto 1 is straightforward. It supports AC charging at speeds up to 6.6 kilowatts. It also accepts DC fast charging, with the base model charging at 30 kilowatts and the extended-range version charging at 40 kilowatts. Each version includes a vehicle-to-load system, so you can power small devices using the car's battery if needed.",

      "Despite its price, the Atto 1 delivers more than the bare essentials. It comes equipped with a 7-inch digital instrument cluster and a 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system. You'll also get wireless Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth phone-as-key functionality, and automatic LED headlights. Keyless entry, start, and NFC digital key compatibility add to the convenience, while single-zone air conditioning and four built-in speakers round out the cabin experience.",

      "If you upgrade to the long-range version, you'll notice a few more touches that make daily driving feel smoother. It features a powered driver's seat, wireless charging for your phone, and a steering wheel that adjusts for both height and reach. Even small conveniences, like a one-touch power window with pinch protection, make it feel like a more premium vehicle.",
      "In terms of size, the Atto 1 measures just under 156 inches long and about 68 inches wide. That makes it slightly larger than the Mitsubishi Mirage but still smaller than a Toyota Yaris. Unlike either of those gas-powered models, the Atto 1 is fully electric and built with clean transportation in mind.",

      "Why BYD's Atto 1 EV launch is perfectly timed for global buyers",
      "The Atto 1's release comes as major automakers begin ramping up their own EV efforts in Asia. Toyota, which controls roughly 30 percent of the Indonesian car market, has already announced plans to begin producing electric vehicles in the country by the end of 2025. BYD's decision to launch an affordable EV now reflects a different strategy, offering a real, driveable solution that doesn't force buyers to wait years or spend a fortune.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For people around the world, access to a private vehicle means independence. Many of those people also want to transition away from internal combustion engines, but cost remains a major barrier. That's where the Atto 1 could make a global impact. It provides a realistic way for people to go electric without breaking their budget or sacrificing comfort.",
      "Interior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If a car like the Atto 1 enters the U.S. market, it could change the game for everyday drivers. First time buyers, students, and city dwellers looking for a compact, clean, and connected ride might finally have an option that fits both their lifestyle and their wallet. The Atto 1 may not drive itself or hit 200 miles per hour, but it's designed to handle real-world needs with style and reliability.",
      "Exterior of Atto 1\u00a0 (BYD)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Electric cars won't truly change the world unless they become accessible. That means more than just flashy features or long ranges. It means building EVs that people can actually afford and use every day.

      "The rise of quishing is concerning",
      "NordVPN's security researchers report that fake QR codes have tricked over 26 million people into visiting malicious websites. These codes hide in plain sight, too. In one case, they were stuck on top of payment portals, sending unsuspecting individuals to sites meant to steal their personal and financial data (e.g., passwords and credit card information). Some even installed malware on people's phones.",
      "Even government agencies have taken notice. The FTC warned the public earlier this year that cybercriminals are now attaching harmful QR codes to packages and sending them to people. The New York City Department of Transportation issued warnings about fake QR codes appearing on parking meters of all places. Even Hawaii Electric chimed in, as they noticed scammers are using QR codes to steal payments.",

Cybercriminals often cover genuine QR codes with malicious ones that redirect users to fake websites meant to steal personal and financial information. Always ask yourself: Do I trust this location or the person who provided this QR code? If in doubt, don't scan.",
      "Consider using a reputable personal data removal service. These services routinely scan the web for your personal details (like addresses, phone numbers, and emails), removing them from public databases where cybercriminals might collect information to personalize their quishing lures.",

    "story": [
      "'The Big Weekend Show' discusses Democratic and Republican TikTokers mocking each others' makeup looks.",
      "Carbon dioxide usually gets blamed for climate change, not praised for solving it. But Google plans to flip the script. The company just announced a partnership with Italian firm Energy Dome to help store clean energy using carbon dioxide in an entirely new way.",
      "This collaboration will deploy long-duration energy storage systems, also known as LDES, at Google's renewable energy projects across the globe. The idea is simple yet powerful: store extra energy when wind and solar production are high, and release it when the skies darken or the wind dies down.",
      "Most current batteries can only provide about four hours of backup power. That might help during short dips in production, but it fails during overnight outages or cloudy, windless days. Energy Dome offers a better solution.",

      "STOP GOOGLE FROM FOLLOWING YOUR EVERY MOVE",
      "Energy Dome's CO2 Battery. (Energy Dome)",
      "Why Google chose the CO2 Battery",
      "Google selected Energy Dome's CO2 Battery because it provides clean, dispatchable energy for up to 24 hours. Unlike lithium-ion systems, which depend on expensive and often hard-to-source materials, this battery uses off-the-shelf mechanical components and simple physics.",
      "Instead of storing electricity in chemical form, the CO2 Battery stores it by compressing carbon dioxide gas into a liquid. When the power grid needs more electricity, the system heats and expands that liquid CO2 back into a gas. As the gas expands, it spins a turbine, just like steam would, which generates electricity.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Once the gas cools, the system captures it again in the dome for future use. This closed-loop process repeats as needed, providing an efficient, carbon-free way to smooth out power demand and supply.",
      "Energy Dome has already proven that the technology works. Its first commercial facility in Italy has been operating successfully for over three years. With a 20-megawatt, 200-megawatt-hour capacity, the plant proves that carbon dioxide can play a surprisingly powerful role in making renewable energy more dependable.",
      "How the Energy Dome's CO2 Battery's charge and discharge works. (Energy Dome)",
      "A Scalable, reliable way to store clean power",
      "Google's backing could significantly accelerate the global rollout of this technology. While wind and solar are affordable and widely available, they remain inconsistent by nature. Without storage, their reliability suffers.",
      "Energy Dome's CO2 Battery helps bridge this gap. It can store renewable energy when production is high and release it when demand peaks. This flexibility supports not just Google's data centers but entire communities that rely on a stable power grid.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The battery also offers another key benefit. Its spinning machinery adds natural inertia to the grid. That helps stabilize power flow, which becomes more important as older fossil fuel plants shut down and leave behind fewer tools for grid balancing.",
      "By investing in Energy Dome and planning commercial deployments in regions like North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, Google hopes to meet its goal of operating on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.",
      "Energy Dome's CO2 Battery. (Energy Dome)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough in energy storage will impact far more than Google's internal operations. As this technology expands, more people could benefit from reliable electricity even when solar panels stop producing or the wind turbines stop turning.",
      "Cleaner and more flexible energy storage also reduces the need for fossil fuel power plants. That shift helps lower emissions and create a more resilient grid for homes, schools, hospitals, and businesses.",
      "The scalability of the CO2 Battery opens the door to broader access. Communities around the world could see improvements in both affordability and energy security as deployment grows.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Google's partnership with Energy Dome solves a very current problem. The world needs clean energy that works around the clock, not just when the weather cooperates. Long-duration energy storage delivers that reliability. By storing power in carbon dioxide and releasing it on demand, this new battery model offers a cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable solution. With global investments and commercial projects already underway, the future of clean energy could arrive much sooner than expected.",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 06:00:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
    "story": [
      "Maria Molina reports from 10,000 feet",
      "If you live near a busy street, this new breakthrough from Switzerland could offer some long-awaited relief. Researchers at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA) have developed an ultra-thin traffic noise absorber that significantly reduces sound levels while occupying just a fraction of the space required by traditional materials.",
      "The new absorber is only about 2.1 inches thick, yet it performs on par with much bulkier products, such as rock wool. Even more impressively, it can be customized to target specific types of noise, making it ideal for a variety of indoor and outdoor settings.",

      "SUSTAINABLE 3D-PRINTED HOME BIULT PRIMARILY FROM SOIL",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "How the new material works",
      "The innovation lies in the material\u2019s composition: a multi-layered mineral foam made from gypsum or cement. Each layer contains pores of different sizes, designed to force air particles to travel in longer, more winding paths. That extended journey helps dissipate sound waves more efficiently than flat or uniform insulation.",
      "EMPA researchers also use numerical modeling to simulate how sound will move through the material. By adjusting pore sizes, perforation patterns, and layer thickness, they can fine-tune the acoustic performance for a specific space or type of noise. This kind of control makes the absorber suitable for locations ranging from quiet stairwells to bustling office environments.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Ultra-thin traffic noise absorber. (EMPA)",
      "Real-world test in Zurich",
      "To test the material in a real-world setting, the EMPA team installed a prototype in a driveway in Zurich. They covered roughly 130 square feet of wall space with panels just over 2 inches thick. One end of the driveway opens onto a busy street, while the other leads into a quieter courtyard.",
      "The results were immediate and measurable. Traffic noise dropped by as much as 4 decibels. The sound reduction was most noticeable when cars entered or exited the driveway, since the panels caused the noise to bounce multiple times before reaching the courtyard. For context, a 4-decibel reduction is sufficient to noticeably reduce the irritation caused by street noise, especially in densely populated urban areas.",
      "Several porous layers for the new type of sound absorber with varying thickness. (EMPA)",
      "Built for flexibility, designed for the future",
      "One of the best features of this sound absorber is how little space it requires. Traditional insulation materials tend to eat up valuable inches, limiting where they can be used. This thin, dense material offers more freedom for architects, interior designers, and developers to include noise protection in areas where every inch matters.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The panels can also withstand outdoor elements. They are weather-resistant, fireproof, and made of recyclable materials, making them both durable and environmentally responsible. Because they do not release harmful particles, they are also safe for indoor use in places like schools, offices, and apartment buildings.",
      "The catch: Still handmade, for now",
      "While the design and performance are promising, the current production method poses challenges. The panel perforation is still done manually, which makes it time-consuming and difficult to scale. However, EMPA is already working with Swiss manufacturer De Cavis to streamline production and prepare for broader commercial use. Once automated, this material could become a standard feature in construction projects where noise control and space efficiency are both top priorities.",
      "Sound absorbers tested in a driveway in Zurich. (EMPA)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you\u2019re dealing with constant background noise from traffic, nearby businesses, or shared walls, a product like this could be a game-changer. A thinner absorber means you can finally enjoy peace and quiet without sacrificing living or workspace space.",
      "Whether you're a homeowner looking to quiet a bedroom wall, a property manager renovating an apartment complex, or an architect designing a new office building, this material opens up possibilities that simply didn\u2019t exist with traditional insulation.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Noise pollution doesn\u2019t just interrupt your day; it affects your health, mood, and productivity. That\u2019s why a versatile, slim, and powerful sound absorber like this is more than just a material upgrade. It\u2019s a lifestyle upgrade. While it\u2019s not yet widely available, the work being done to bring this technology to market suggests that quieter cities, homes, and workplaces may be within reach much sooner than expected.",

      "\"Trump's frustrated that the Russians have not taken advantage of his patience and generous offers, but it's very interesting that even after Trump announced he was moving submarines, and even after he announced the tough tariffs, the Russians still want to talk to him,\" Fred Fleitz, who served as a deputy assistant to Trump and chief of staff of the National Security Council during the president\u2019s first term, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House brought with it a sense of shock as he appeared to distance Washington from its top allies in Europe in favor of attempting to improve diplomatic relations with Putin, culminating in the infamous Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February.",
      "While the tussle brought renewed support from his top MAGA base, who favor ending U.S. involvement in foreign wars, it prompted concern among security experts. Ultimately, Trump\u2019s patience with Putin began to shift, with the president consistently expressing his frustration at the Kremlin chief\u2019s continued brutal attacks in Ukraine.",
      "In mid-July, while sitting next to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Trump announced Putin had 50 days to enter into a ceasefire or face \"very severe\" tariffs that would affect Moscow's top commodity, oil.",

      "\"Tariffs at about 100%, you'd call them secondary tariffs,\" he had said, indicating that nations that trade with Russia will see 100% tariffs slapped on them when trading with the U.S.",
      "This would most greatly affect China and India, according to data released by the U.S. government Thursday, which showed both nations account for 46% of all Russian oil purchases in 2025.",
      "But the U.S. is also the No. 1 export market for both China and India, which means higher price tags at the checkout line on their products will make Americans think twice before completing those purchases.",
      "After ongoing trade negotiations with both nations and Putin\u2019s continued war effort in Ukraine, Trump last week pushed up his deadline to within 10 days\u00a0of July 29, forcing a new deadline of Friday.",
      "But while his promised tariffs were met with applause by some in the GOP, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. \u2014 he, along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-C.T., is pushing the charge for 500% sanctions on Russia \u2014 other Republican members have not backed the move.",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has been outspoken against not only Trump\u2019s tariffs but the bipartisan sanction push and argued to Fox Business\u2019 Larry Kudlow this week that Trump\u2019s tariffs on allies and foes alike will amount to $2 trillion in taxes for the American consumer.",
      "But Fleitz pushed back on this argument and said he is not convinced that the tariffs will hurt the U.S. or Chinese economy, though Russia and India are likely to feel the pain.",
      "\"I think they're going to hurt the Russian and Indian economies,\" he said, noting that India could recover by buying oil elsewhere. Though some reporting has suggested that India may have saved over $30 billion by increasingly turning to Russian oil during 2022-2024 due to Moscow\u2019s price cuts.",

      "\"The day my intuition says Trump is ready to talk, I won't hesitate to call him,\" Lula told Reuters. \"But today my intuition says he doesn't want to talk. And I won't humiliate myself.\"",
      "More than 60 countries and the European Union were hit with new tariffs just after midnight on Thursday. While the baseline rate is 10%, select nations, like Brazil, face additional penalties that push the total tariff up to 50%.",

      "\"The ones who determine Brazil's direction are the Brazilians and their institutions. At this moment, we are working to protect our economy, businesses, and workers, and to respond to the tariff measures of the U.S. government,\" Lula wrote.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to convene his high-level security cabinet on Thursday to discuss expanding the war against Hamas, including the potential full military occupation of the Gaza Strip.",
      "The prospect comes against the backdrop of the 20th anniversary of Israel\u2019s full disengagement from the enclave, as calls for resettlement \u2014 once confined to the political fringes \u2014 have entered the mainstream, including within the government, particularly in the wake of Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 massacre.",
      "Rebuilding Jewish communities in Gaza would be \"a historic correction to a national injustice,\" Yitzhak Wasserlauf, Israel\u2019s minister for the Development of the Periphery, the Negev and the Galilee, told Fox News Digital.",
      "FOX NEWS GETS INSIDE LOOK AT GAZA HUMANITARIAN SITUATION AS ISRAEL WEIGHS NEXT STEPS",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stands on a platform overlooking the Gaza Strip during his first visit to Kibbutz Nir Oz since the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas terrorists where a significant number of this community were killed or captured, near the Israel-Gaza border in southern Israel, on Thursday, July 3, 2025. (AP Photo/Leo Correa)",
      "\"Expelling Jews from their homes in their own country was a strategic and moral mistake that led to the rise of an Islamist terrorist regime called Hamas,\" he said. \"That mistake enabled Hamas to fire relentless rockets and ultimately carry out the October 7 massacre \u2014 which included murder, rape, abuse, looting, and, of course, the kidnapping of soldiers and civilians.\"",
      "Wasserlauf invoked the bloc of 17 Israeli communities, collectively known as Gush Katif, which was established in Gaza after the 1967 Six-Day War. In August 2005, as part of Israel\u2019s\u00a0unilateral disengagement, the government forcibly removed approximately 8,600 Jewish residents from the area.",
      "He said reapplying Israeli sovereignty \"would send a clear message: whoever strikes us loses the ground beneath his feet. Only in this way can true deterrence be achieved,\" Wasserlauf continued. \"We need to create facts on the ground. There must be no agreements with terrorists. Settlement in Gaza must, at the very least, be the price that reminds everyone terrorism does not pay.\"",
      "From 1948 to 1967, the Gaza Strip was under Egyptian occupation. After Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, it remained under full Israeli control until 1994, when administrative responsibility was transferred to the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo Accords \u2014 paving the way for Yasser Arafat\u2019s return from exile in Tunis.",
      "Hamas terrorists emerge from the shadows as they surround Red Cross vehicles. (TPS-IL)",
      "In 2005, Israel evacuated all military personnel and civilian communities from Gaza. Shortly thereafter, Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections and staged a violent coup to overthrow the Palestinian Authority and seize control of the Strip.",
      "Wasserlauf argued that critics of the disengagement had long warned that any concession of land would only embolden terrorists. These warnings, he said, were ignored, but ultimately proven correct by the events that followed.",
      "He acknowledged that renewed settlement in Gaza would likely trigger political backlash both domestically and abroad. \"The countries that support us will stand with us, and those that consistently oppose us will remain against us \u2026 I remind you that there were countries that urged us not to strike Iran, despite its race toward nuclear weapons and its explicit goal of destroying Israel.\"",

      "He estimated that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) currently controls about 75% of Gaza, with past decisions largely driven by military considerations. However, he said that the remaining 25% of the territory involves broader strategic decisions, shaped by how Israel and the United States view the future of the area, including Jewish settlement.",

    "summary": "The announcement comes after Trump fired the previous Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, claiming without evidence that the July jobs report was \"rigged.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump announced Monday that he planned to nominate E.J. Antoni, the chief economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, as the new commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"E.J. will ensure that the Numbers released are HONEST and ACCURATE.\"",
      "Antoni\u2019s planned nomination comes after Trump fired former commissioner Erika McEntarfer hours after a weaker-than-expected jobs report on Aug. 1. Trump said, without evidence, that the jobs report for July was \u201cRIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad.\u201d",
      "Antoni did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment Monday.",
      "Steve Bannon, a senior adviser to Trump in his first term, had been pushing hard for Antoni\u2019s nomination. Antoni, a contributor to the Project 2025 policy rubric, has been a longtime skeptic of BLS data. On Bannon\u2019s podcast last week, Antoni called for McEntarfer to be fired shortly before Trump pulled the trigger.",
      "As chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, Antoni has written a number of pieces for the think tank that are highly complimentary of the Trump administration. One of his recent reports said that the June jobs report, before it was revised, was a \u201chome run\u201d for the president.",
      "Multiple former BLS commissioners said after McEntarfer's firing that the head of labor statistics does not have a role in compiling the jobs report and is only briefed on its figures shortly before it is released to the public.",
      "In that report, the BLS reported that the U.S. economy added just 73,000 jobs in July. The agency also said it had revised the May and June numbers and that they turned out to be lower than previously announced, by more than 200,000 jobs.",
      "The BLS routinely revises economic data such as the jobs report, gross domestic product figures and inflation data. Due to the scale of the U.S. economy and response rates to BLS surveys, there can often be lags in data collection. But that lag does not imply any wrongdoing or manipulation.",
      "The data that the bureau produces is massively important to businesses, policy makers and government agencies because without it, the true condition of the U.S. economy might be harder to determine.",
      "The accuracy of the data that BLS produces is \"built on a foundation of trust,\" JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist said last week. Economists widely warned that firing of McEntarfer could pose a risk to global markets, financial stability and the overall U.S. economy because so much rests on the integrity of the agency's data.",
      "The BLS data and that of other U.S. statistics agencies have so far been considered the gold standard globally because historically those government entities have been allowed to operate with little to no political interference.",
      "Jason Furman, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the White House under President Barack Obama, said Monday that \"E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant experience.\"",
      "\"He would be a break from decades of nonpartisan technocrats,\" Furman added in a post on X.",
      "Rachel Bovard, vice president of programs at the Conservative Partnership Institute, called Antoni \u201cwhip smart, passionate, and committed to excellence \u2014 three qualities that will turn the BLS from an agency that\u2019s apparently still playing catch up with accurate data to one which is transparent, reliable, and correct.\u201d",
      "Many previous commissioners served across administrations, such as Trump's nominee to the agency during his first term. William Beach, nominated in 2019, served through March 2023. Keith Hall, nominated by President George W. Bush, took up the commissioner role in January 2008 and continued until January 2012 under President Barack Obama.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration agreed to once again delay the deadline when tariffs on Chinese imports would rise as discussions between the two sides continue.",
      "The new deadline would be November 10.",
      "\"All other elements of the Agreement will remain the same,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "For companies and consumers, another pause means continued uncertainty as President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff regime enters its fifth month.",
      "Last week, import taxes went into effect for dozens of countries. Prices have ticked up in the United States while existing tariffs on imports from China and others work their way into the economy, with companies eating much of the higher costs and consumers absorbing some. Trump has downplayed inflation concerns and lauded the tens of billions of dollars in federal revenue from the levies.",
      "It's second time that the Trump administration has delayed imposing even higher tariffs on China, which is one of America\u2019s largest trading partners. In 2024, the United States imported more than $438 billion worth of goods, including everything from clothing to electronics to toys, from China.",
      "While there's no deal in hand, there's been movement on a few fronts. Just days ago, President Donald Trump authorized Nvidia and AMD to begin selling some of their artificial intelligence semiconductors into China again. China has also reportedly eased some restrictions on exports of rare earth metals. Those were key issues for both sides.",
      "Trump\u2019s back-and-forth with China over tariffs started just days after he re-entered office. In early February, he imposed a 10% tariff on all imports from China which quickly retaliated with higher tariffs of its own. Then, on April 2, Trump said he would slap a 34% tariff on China.",
      "Then, a week later, after China hiked its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%, Trump said on Truth Social: \u201cBased on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately.\u201d That brought all of China\u2019s tariffs to a total of 145%.",
      "In early May, seeking to defuse the tension, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva. Following those talks, China and the U.S. both lowered tariffs on each other by 115% for 90 days. The resulting U.S. tariff on Chinese goods remained at 30%.",
      "Just weeks later, Trump said on Truth Social that \u201cChina, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.\u201d U.S. officials later said that China was \u201cslow rolling\u201d the delivery of rare earths.",
      "Bessent and Greer met again with their counterparts, namely China\u2019s Vice Premier He Lifeng, in London in mid-June. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also joined those talks, which yielded positive language.",
      "\u201cThe two largest economies in the world have reached a handshake for a framework,\u201d Lutnick said at the conclusion of the London talks. Since that meeting, the details of that framework agreement has not been released or published by either government.",
      "But those discussions did eventually lead to China resuming shipments of some rare earths used for manufacturing vehicles, smartphones, batteries and a number of other everyday items. The U.S. also allowed A.I. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to restart sales of some of their chips into China, which they were temporarily banned from doing. Nvidia took a $5.5 billion hit from that ban while AMD predicted an $800 million impact.",
      "But a fully-fledged trade deal with China remains elusive despite at least seven days of face-to-face talks this year between high ranking officials on both sides."

    "summary": "President Trump agreed to once again delay the deadline when China\u2019s tariffs would rise as discussions between the two sides continue.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration agreed to once again delay the deadline when tariffs on Chinese imports would rise as discussions between the two sides continue.",
      "The new deadline would be November 10.",
      "\"All other elements of the Agreement will remain the same,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "For companies and consumers, another pause means continued uncertainty as President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff regime enters its fifth month.",
      "Last week, import taxes went into effect for dozens of countries. Prices have ticked up in the United States while existing tariffs on imports from China and others work their way into the economy, with companies eating much of the higher costs and consumers absorbing some. Trump has downplayed inflation concerns and lauded the tens of billions of dollars in federal revenue from the levies.",
      "It's second time that the Trump administration has delayed imposing even higher tariffs on China, which is one of America\u2019s largest trading partners. In 2024, the United States imported more than $438 billion worth of goods, including everything from clothing to electronics to toys, from China.",
      "While there's no deal in hand, there's been movement on a few fronts. Just days ago, President Donald Trump authorized Nvidia and AMD to begin selling some of their artificial intelligence semiconductors into China again. China has also reportedly eased some restrictions on exports of rare earth metals. Those were key issues for both sides.",
      "Trump\u2019s back-and-forth with China over tariffs started just days after he re-entered office. In early February, he imposed a 10% tariff on all imports from China which quickly retaliated with higher tariffs of its own. Then, on April 2, Trump said he would slap a 34% tariff on China.",
      "Then, a week later, after China hiked its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%, Trump said on Truth Social: \u201cBased on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately.\u201d That brought all of China\u2019s tariffs to a total of 145%.",
      "In early May, seeking to defuse the tension, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer met with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva. Following those talks, China and the U.S. both lowered tariffs on each other by 115% for 90 days. The resulting U.S. tariff on Chinese goods remained at 30%.",
      "Just weeks later, Trump said on Truth Social that \u201cChina, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.\u201d U.S. officials later said that China was \u201cslow rolling\u201d the delivery of rare earths.",
      "Bessent and Greer met again with their counterparts, namely China\u2019s Vice Premier He Lifeng, in London in mid-June. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also joined those talks, which yielded positive language.",
      "\u201cThe two largest economies in the world have reached a handshake for a framework,\u201d Lutnick said at the conclusion of the London talks. Since that meeting, the details of that framework agreement has not been released or published by either government.",
      "But those discussions did eventually lead to China resuming shipments of some rare earths used for manufacturing vehicles, smartphones, batteries and a number of other everyday items. The U.S. also allowed A.I. chipmakers Nvidia and AMD to restart sales of some of their chips into China, which they were temporarily banned from doing. Nvidia took a $5.5 billion hit from that ban while AMD predicted an $800 million impact.",
      "But a fully-fledged trade deal with China remains elusive despite at least seven days of face-to-face talks this year between high ranking officials on both sides."

Antoni, a contributor to the Project 2025 policy rubric, has been a longtime skeptic of BLS data. On Bannon\u2019s podcast last week, Antoni called for McEntarfer to be fired shortly before Trump pulled the trigger.",
      "As chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, Antoni has written a number of pieces for the think tank that are highly complimentary of the Trump administration. One of his recent reports said that the June jobs report, before it was revised, was a \u201chome run\u201d for the president.",
      "Multiple former BLS commissioners said after McEntarfer's firing that the head of labor statistics does not have a role in compiling the jobs report and is only briefed on its figures shortly before it is released to the public.",

      "The BLS routinely revises economic data such as the jobs report, gross domestic product figures and inflation data. Due to the scale of the U.S. economy and response rates to BLS surveys, there can often be lags in data collection. But that lag does not imply any wrongdoing or manipulation.",
      "The data that the bureau produces is massively important to businesses, policy makers and government agencies because without it, the true condition of the U.S. economy might be harder to determine.",
      "The accuracy of the data that BLS produces is \"built on a foundation of trust,\" JPMorgan's chief U.S. economist said last week. Economists widely warned that firing of McEntarfer could pose a risk to global markets, financial stability and the overall U.S. economy because so much rests on the integrity of the agency's data.",
      "The BLS data and that of other U.S. statistics agencies have so far been considered the gold standard globally because historically those government entities have been allowed to operate with little to no political interference.",
      "Jason Furman, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the White House under President Barack Obama, said Monday that \"E.J. Antoni is completely unqualified to be BLS commissioner. He is an extreme partisan and does not have any relevant experience.\"",

      "Many previous commissioners served across administrations, such as Trump's nominee to the agency during his first term. William Beach, nominated in 2019, served through March 2023. Keith Hall, nominated by President George W. Bush, took up the commissioner role in January 2008 and continued until January 2012 under President Barack Obama.",
      "President Joe Biden nominated McEntarfer in July 2023. She was confirmed by the Senate in a 86-8 vote in January 2024. Vice President JD Vance, then a senator, cast one of the votes in her favor."

      "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, Jonathan Allen breaks down President Donald Trump\u2019s move to put the D.C. police under federal control. Plus, Bridget Bowman speaks with a New Yorker who voted for Trump and Zohran Mamdani.",

      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "The political \u2014 and historical \u2014 context of Trump\u2019s D.C. crackdown",
      "Donald Trump isn\u2019t the first president to deploy troops and federal agents in the name of safeguarding the nation\u2019s capital, but he has been particularly selective about what represents a threat to the peace. And this time, he may capitalize on it politically.",
      "In the summer of 2020, Trump amassed a heavily armed force in Lafayette Square, steps from the White House, and unleashed it on peaceful protesters demonstrating against unprovoked police violence.",
      "Several months later, he chose not to mobilize the D.C. National Guard or the thousands of federal law enforcement agents under his command to defend the Capitol from his supporters. They assaulted police officers, broke into the Capitol, defaced property and looked for politicians to harm.",
      "In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect the Capitol during the riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. But Trump took no such defensive measures against the MAGA mob in 2021.",
      "Now, restored to the presidency and having granted clemency to the Jan. 6 rioters, he says he wants to save Washington from its own residents \u2014 using officers from an alphabet soup of federal agencies and the D.C. National Guard to patrol the streets. Trump also federalized the metropolitan police force, which he can do for 30 days without congressional approval.",
      "In appointing himself Washington\u2019s top cop, he promised to clean up a city that he described as having been \u201covertaken\u201d by \u201cbloodthirsty criminals.\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi went a step further, vowing that \u201ccrime in D.C. is ending today.\u201d",
      "That obviously won\u2019t happen. But two things can be true at once: D.C. residents are the victims of too many violent crimes, and the rate of those violent crimes has dropped noticeably. That should make it easier for Trump to keep this promise \u2014 he can just take credit for what was already in motion \u2014 than the ones that have fallen short: ending inflation and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, among others.",
      "For longtime Washingtonians, the idea that the city has become some sort of dystopian criminal nightmare ignores history. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city was overrun by drug lords \u2014 the mayor at the time was arrested after he was caught smoking crack cocaine \u2014 and it was known as the murder capital of the world. At the peak in 1991, there were more than 500 homicides in the district, and open-air drug markets thrived.",
      "Perhaps the most important statistic in assessing how residents feel about the city is the steady increase in population over the last 25 years. During that time, the city\u2019s gross domestic product has nearly quadrupled, and neighborhoods that had been left for dead have been revitalized all over Washington.",
      "Those basic trend lines figure to continue, with or without Trump\u2019s deployment of force. In the meantime, he has portrayed himself again as a proponent of \u201claw and order\u201d \u2014 so long as it serves his political ends \u2014 which could allow him to position himself to take credit for a relatively safe and prosperous city, and leave Democrats to fight over how much crime-fighting is too much.",
      "Meet the voter who backed Trump and Zohran Mamdani",
      "To better understand how two candidates as ideologically opposed as President Donald Trump and New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani could rise to prominence, just ask Ray. He voted for both of them.",
      "\u201cThey are not afraid of shying away from who they are as a person,\u201d said the 34-year-old New Yorker who works in finance. (Ray declined to share his last name out of concern that he could face backlash for his political views.)",
      "I first spoke with Ray in January when we reached out to some of the swing voters who propelled Trump to victory last year. I called him back recently to ask how he thought the Trump administration was doing so far. Ray is not happy, but he acknowledged that he was expecting Trump to shake things up. That\u2019s when he mentioned that he had also voted for Mamdani in this year\u2019s Democratic primary for New York City mayor.",
      "\u201cLike Trump, I don\u2019t agree with all his views,\u201d Ray said of Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist. \u201cBut he makes the effort to go out and talk to people and reach out to people and try to actually do things that are better for the working class.\u201d",
      "The son of Asian immigrants, Ray has not always been tuned into politics. He registered as a Democrat to have a say in the deep blue city\u2019s politics and because the party supported policies he benefitted from as a kid, like public education, school lunches and afterschool programs.",
      "Ray voted for Joe Biden in 2020, looking for a return to normalcy amid the Covid pandemic. After Biden\u2019s election, Ray\u2019s politics started to shift as he helped his mom, a landlord, navigate pandemic-era policies on evictions and rent freezes, including pursuing a restraining order against a tenant who pulled a knife on her when she tried to collect rent. Ray also recalled a pivotal moment during a trip to Washington, D.C., when protesters hurled a racial slur at him and his now-wife.",
      "\u201cWhen I was voting for Biden, it was the expectation that things will go back to normal,\u201d Ray said, later adding, \u201cThe problem is we never really got the normalcy.\u201d",
      "So he cast his ballot for Trump in 2024, the first time he had ever supported a Republican.",
      "Fast forward to June of this year, and Ray saw a video on social media of Mamdani slamming former Gov. Andrew Cuomo during a mayoral primary debate. Mamdani pointed to Cuomo\u2019s resignation as governor in 2021 amid allegations of sexual harassment, which Cuomo has denied.",
      "\u201dMamdani, really, he had no shame in talking about it. He had no shame in who he was. And he had no shame on his own policies and his own thoughts and what would be best for the city,\u201d Ray said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about Republicans or Democrats in my mind,\u201d Ray said, adding that he is drawn to a candidate \u201cwho is honest, who\u2019s authentic, and someone who has the benefits of the little person in the back of their mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think having that\u2019s important, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s missing in the politics these days,\u201d he said.",

      "Cooprider, 34, declined to comment Monday.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, contains several purported text messages the pair exchanged for weeks, beginning Jan. 31, when Davis asked Cooprider for his input in case she is confirmed to be pregnant.",
      "Cooprider said he \u201cwould like to get rid of it,\u201d the texts show, saying the two were \u201cnot in love\u201d or together and that it would be \u201cmessed up to bring a child into the world without both parents raising them.\u201d",

      "\u201cEvery time you say \u2018get rid of it\u2019 it\u2019s like an electric shock,\u201d she wrote, according to the lawsuit. \u201cI literally feel like I\u2019m going down the steepest hill on a roller coaster when I read that.\u201d",
      "The following text messages allegedly show Cooprider telling Davis, without her approval, that he would order abortion pills online. The pills were purchased from Aid Access, an online service that ships abortion pills to Americans from abroad, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Aid Access, and Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, a Dutch physician who runs it, are also listed as defendants in the lawsuit. They did not immediately return requests for comment.",

      "Davis, who was eight weeks pregnant, accepted. When the two met up at Davis\u2019 Corpus Christi residence on the night of April 5, Cooprider handed her a cup of hot chocolate shortly before midnight, according to the lawsuit. Within 30 minutes of drinking it, the suit says, Davis began hemorrhaging and cramping.",
      "Davis knew she had to go to the emergency room, but she knew she could not leave her three children who were sleeping upstairs, the suit said. They came up with a plan for Cooprider to pick up Davis\u2019 mother, who lived nearby, so she could watch the children while Cooprider took Davis to the hospital.",
      "But once Cooprider left the house, he became unreachable, according to the lawsuit.",

      "Davis\u2019s mother took an Uber ride to her daughter\u2019s house around 1 a.m. Around that time, Cooprider apologized and said he had to catch a flight the next day, the suit said.",
      "A neighbor drove Davis to the hospital, where her unborn baby, whom she had named Joy, did not survive.",
      "Back home, Davis said she found the opened box of abortion pills and a pill bottle, which she turned over to the Corpus Christi police, according to the lawsuit. The suit claims Cooprider mixed 10 misoprostol pills into the hot chocolate.",

      "\u201cRussia has occupied a big portion of Ukraine. They\u2019ve occupied some very prime territory. We\u2019re going to try and get some of that territory back for Ukraine,\u201d Trump said at a news conference at the White House.",
      "Trump said he\u2019s going to see what Putin \u201chas in mind\u201d to end the war and, if it\u2019s a \u201cfair deal,\u201d he will share it with European and NATO leaders, as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who have been liaising closely with Washington ahead of the meeting.",
      "Asked Monday if Zelenskyy was invited to the meeting Friday with Putin in Alaska, Trump said that the Ukrainian leader \u201cwasn\u2019t a part of it\u201d and that despite his having participated in numerous sitdowns over the course of the war, little has come of them. \u201cI would say he could go, but he\u2019s gone to a lot of meetings. You know, he\u2019s been there for three and a half years \u2014 nothing happened,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The president's first call out of the Putin meeting, which he referred to as \u201creally a feel-out,\u201d would be to Zelenskyy \u201cout of respect.\u201d  He noted that he might tell Zelenskyy \"\u2018lots of luck, keep fighting,\u2019 or I may say, \u2018We can make a deal.\u2019\"",
      "The comments came during a winding press conference to discuss efforts to fight crime in Washington, D.C., with a plan to federalize the city\u2019s police force.",
      "During his remarks, the president noted how even following \u201ca great call\u201d with Putin in the past, \u201cmissiles would be lobbed into Kyiv or some other place, and you\u2019d have 60 people laying on a road dying,\u201d a nod to the challenge of reaching a deal.",
      "A follow-up meeting could include Zelenskyy and Putin, and perhaps Trump himself, the president added. He said he would \u201cbe there if they need.\u201d",
      "But Trump said a Zelenskyy and Putin meeting was the only way to bring the conflict to a close.",
      "\u201cNow, I will say this, ultimately, I\u2019m going to put the two of them in a room, I\u2019ll be there or won\u2019t be there, and I think it\u2019ll get solved,\u201d the president added.",
      "He said he would like to see a ceasefire and reach the \u201cbest deal that could be made for both parties.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthere\u2019ll be some swapping, there\u2019ll be some changes in land,\u201d Trump said, returning to the idea of \u201cland swaps,\u201d which he said Friday would be \u201cto the betterment of both.\u201d Zelenskyy, though, has been unwavering in his position that Ukraine should not cede any territory to Russia; European allies have agreed that giving up lands would encourage further Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cThe answer to Ukraine\u2019s territorial question is already in the constitution of Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said Saturday. \u201cNo one will and no one can deviate from it. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d",
      "Trump announced last week that he is meeting with Putin on Friday in Alaska as he tries to reach a ceasefire in Ukraine. The White House had initially held out a meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy as a condition for a meeting between Trump and the Russian president to take place, but Trump later said that was not a precondition.",
      "The White House emphasized over the weekend that the priority is the upcoming one-on-one with Putin, even as it weighed the prospect of a future meeting with Zelenskyy.",
      "\u201cNext Friday will be important, because it will be about testing Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end,\u201d NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said over the weekend on ABC.",
      "Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin in Moscow last week ahead of an Aug. 8 deadline that the president had set for the Russian leader to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions.",
      "Putin proposed the outlines of an agreement to end the war that would allow Russia to hold sweeping Ukrainian territory, but has not agreed to a ceasefire.",
      "Zelenskyy has urged stronger international pressure on Russia, warning against concessions to Moscow.",
      "\u201cAnother week has ended without any attempt by Russia to agree to the numerous demands of the world and stop the killings,\u201d the Ukrainian leader said on X.",
      "\u201cRussia is dragging out the war, and therefore it deserves stronger global pressure. Russia refuses to stop the killings, and therefore must not receive any rewards or benefits. And this is not just a moral position \u2014 it is a rational one. Concessions do not persuade a killer. But truly strong protection of life stops the killers,\u201d he added."

      "How I tried men\u2019s running shoes",
      "I have been running regularly as part of my fitness routine for the past five years. I live in New York City and typically run outside on pavement two to three times a week. My distance ranges between three and seven miles, and I use a fitness tracker to help guide my pace. I wear a size 10 shoe in a medium width, and generally prefer cushioned shoes with neutral support, as they mitigate knee pains more than other shoes I\u2019ve tried.",

      "Both Cunha and Zach Moxham, a certified personal trainer at Physical Equilibrium in New York City, recommend going to a local running shoe store for the best fit possible. Specialty running shoe stores tend to have knowledgeable staff who can better inform you about running shoe options and recommendations, says Cunha. They also typically have more measuring tools to take advantage of, including foot scans, gait analysis and treadmill analysis \u2014 try everything and anything, says Moxham.",
      "A poor-fitting running shoe isn\u2019t going to be comfortable, no matter how stylish it may look.",
      "If you plan to buy shoes in person, buy them at the end of the day when your feet are most swollen, says Cunha. That\u2019s because if they feel comfortable when your feet are most swollen, they will likely feel comfortable throughout the day.",
      "Cunha also says to try on at least three different models of shoe, even two different models at the same time, one on each foot, to get a good feel for the fit.",
      "Pay special attention to the toe box \u2014 the area around your toes, says Cunha and Moxham.",
      "\u201cMake sure there is enough room to slightly wiggle your toes,\u201d says Cunha. \u201cIf you can\u2019t move your toes at all then the shoes are too tight and will eventually become painful. The tip of your thumb should fit between the end of the shoe and the end of your longest toe.\u201d",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Training shoes and stylish sneakers look similar to some running shoes, but functionally, they are very different. Running shoes have a stiffer, more shock-absorbing sole that is suited to higher-impact activity, says Cunha. They also guide your motion to increase stability and the proper alignment of your foot. Plus, running shoes minimize fatigue, as they are lighter than other types of shoes.",
      "Finding the perfect pair of running shoes can be liberating \u2014 I know I like running a lot more when I am doing it in my favorite shoes. But regardless of how attached you get to one pair, it\u2019s important to replace your running shoes every six months or so.",
      "\u201cGood sneakers are designed to last for 300 to 500 miles,\u201d says Cunha. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they still look new: if the support is worn out, you\u2019re at a much higher risk of injury.\u201d",
      "To keep track of when it\u2019s time to replace your shoes, note the date you buy a new pair, and keep track of that six-month interval, says Cunha.",
      "Meet our experts",
      "At NBC Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience. We also take steps to ensure all expert advice and recommendations are made independently and without undisclosed financial conflicts of interest.",

      "How to shop for college dorm essentials",
      "Before you start dorm shopping, here are a few things to consider:",
      "Student discounts: While shopping, remember that many retailers offer student discounts and student memberships. For example, after proving that you\u2019re enrolled at a college through your school email address or student ID, you can create an Amazon Prime Student account, which offers benefits like fast shipping and exclusive prices on select products. Brands like Apple and others also offer student pricing, discounts and memberships.Storage Space: Dorm room space is limited, especially if you have a roommate. If you\u2019ve toured your future dorm room or know its dimensions, you can get a sense of what you can and cannot fit in your space. If you haven\u2019t gotten a chance to see your room yet, it may be better to wait to buy larger items like chairs and appliances. Flooring: This is a smaller detail, but knowing if your room is carpeted or has a hardwood floor can impact the products you buy. For example, certain vacuums work better on hard floors but might not be as effective on carpets. Roommates: We suggest coordinating with your roommate for items that will take up a considerable amount of shared space, including appliances like mini-fridges. You can also share items like kitchen appliances and storage solutions between yourselves to save space and money.Bed sizing: Dorm rooms typically use twin XL beds, slightly longer than a standard twin bed. Not all bedding retailers carry products in twin XL sizes, so you should always check which brands carry fitted sheets, flat sheets and other bedding to fit your dorm bed. Dorm rules: Some dorms and residence halls prohibit the use of certain appliances or electronics in a room. Before buying appliances like mini fridges or lamps, be sure to check the guidelines for your dorm or residence hall.",

      "The 31-year-old rapper and singer is currently on his \u201c+Pretty +Dirty World Tour\u201d and recently made a stop in Mexico City. While performing on stage, Maluma noticed that he had a young fan in the audience, and he wasn\u2019t pleased.",
      "In multiple videos shared on social media from the concert, which was held at Palacio de los Deportes arena, Maluma appears to briefly pause the show to call out a fan with a 1-year-old child.",
      "\u201cMa\u2019am, I\u2019m going to tell you something. Leave him there. Don\u2019t bring him,\u201d he repeatedly advises the fan in Spanish.",
      "He then asks, \u201cWith all due respect since now I\u2019m a father, how old is he?\u201d When the concertgoer seemingly confirms the toddler\u2019s age, Maluma continues, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s a good idea to bring a 1-year-old baby to a concert where the decibels are so high?\u201d",

      "\u201cThe truth is that\u2019s an act of irresponsibility, and you were with the boy as if he were a toy,\u201d Maluma added. \u201cThat boy really doesn\u2019t want to be here, really.\u201d",
      "He assured the fan that his harsh criticism came from a place of love and respect given that he is a proud parent.",
      "Before continuing with his show, Maluma concluded, \u201cI didn\u2019t give birth, but I would never have brought a 1-year-old to a concert. So next time, be a little bit more aware, OK?\u201d",
      "As the Grammy-nominated artist mentioned, he became a father for the first time last year when he and his girlfriend, Susana Gomez, welcomed a baby girl together. He shared the news of her arrival on Instagram, revealing in Spanish that their child was born March 9, 2024, at 8:23 a.m. and her name is Paris Londo\u00f1o Gomez.",
      "He uploaded a black-and-white photo of the newborn\u2019s tiny hand and another picture of him sweetly kissing Gomez on the head as she cradled their daughter.",
      "\u201cThank you all for your birthday messages and well wishes. Susana.. Love: Thank you for fulfilling my biggest dream of being a Father, I will never forget that moment,\u201d his translated caption read."

    "story": [
      "Lin-Manuel Miranda's \"Hamilton\" has spent a decade on Broadway and in theaters around the world. Now, a new version of the musical is playing out ... on TikTok.",
      "A \"Hamilton\"-inspired social media trend is more concerned with the founding father\u2019s subpar husband skills than with he changed the United States' trajectory.",
      "The trend involves people, usually women, dressing up like Hamilton \u2014 complete with hand-drawn facial hair and a lantern \u2014 and attempting to sneak away to the tune of the soundtrack\u2019s \u201cBest of Wives and Best of Women.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhy does everyone just casually have a founding father outfit?\u201d said one commenter, asking what much of the internet is likely thinking.",
      "This song captures the moment when Hamilton is leaving for New Jersey to duel his longtime enemy, Aaron Burr. During the sound clip, Eliza asks Hamilton to stay and come back to bed with her. Hamilton protests that he has a meeting at dawn. In the show, this is a tragic interaction, taking place right before Hamilton meets his end.",
      "For TikTok, this song is a perfect moment to highlight Hamilton\u2019s deficiencies as a husband. Hamilton, yet again, is prioritizing his career and reputation over his family ... and it leads to his death.",
      "The trend started in July, when TikTok user @actuallyHamilton posted a recreation of the scene while lip-synching halfway out a window.",
      "From then, the trend has taken off. The internet's new group of \"Hamiltons\" have found other methods of escaping, like a shower window, doggy door, barely open garage door, kayak (and another kayak) and even a washing machine. One throws a suitcase out of a window before trying to leave themselves. Another creative video was filmed entirely on a Nest cam footage.",
      "\u201cSuddenly the implication of this trend that Hamilton has to sneak out of his own home through a window is KILLING me,\u201d reads one comment.",
      "Stephanie Gonzalez, speaking to TODAY.com, said she was \u201cso excited\u201d when she saw the trend: \u201cI had the perfect jacket.\u201d She and her fianc\u00e9 have filmed a series of videos.",
      "\u201cIt is probably the most fun we have had. If someone is looking for a good date night idea, try re-creating these videos,\u201d she tells TODAY.com.",
      "One thing remains consistent across the videos: Hamilton is fed up with Eliza\u2019s clinginess. TikToker\u2019s facial expressions paint a version of Hamilton as the opposite of a family man. The delivery of Hamilton\u2019s \u201cI know\u201d is always particularly sharp, as is the \u201cshh.\u201d",
      "The dark side to Hamilton's personality also comes through in re-creations of other moments from the musical, like when Eliza asks Hamilton to pay attention to their son\u2019s birthday in \"Take a Break.\" When their son Philip raps in the musical, Miranda\u2019s Hamilton looks amused, but on in the social media parodies he\u2019s always slightly annoyed and disgusted.",
      "As one creator put it, the scene is the \u201cI hate my family final boss.\u201d",
      "Others, usually men, are playing Eliza as exasperated and annoyed, a match to Hamilton\u2019s disdain. \u201cThis trend but Eliza is tired of Alexander\u2019s BS,\u201d one creator wrote.",
      "Miranda even got in on the action himself, recreating the trend with his new wax figure for Madame Tussauds with the caption, \u201cBest of wax and best of figures.\u201d",
      "Miranda recently announced a limited theatrical release of Hamilton in early September, so fans will be able to experience that fateful scene \u2014 and Lin\u2019s facial expressions \u2014 on the big screen."

      "\"For one, it's been 30 years, seven months and five days and i still can't believe it,\" Bob Ayers, the father of victim Amy Ayers, said in the first episode of the series, which premiered on Aug. 3.",
      "Over the series' four episodes, which premiere on Sundays at 10 p.m. ET on HBO, those close to the case show how the slayings have continued to go unsolved for more than three decades, and how some Austinites are still traumatized by what happened on the night of Dec. 6, 1991.",

      "\"I had to go in through the party shop, which was next door, because I couldn't go in the front door because the fire department was still in there, knocking down the fire,\" Jones said.",
      "\"It was still smoldering. They had pulled down the ceiling so there was water everywhere, there was steam everywhere, there was smoke everywhere,\" he continued. \"As it started to clear out, you could see the bodies, three together and then one away from the others.\"",
      "Ayers, Thomas, Jennifer Harbison and Sarah Harbison had been gagged, bound and shot in the head before the store was set on fire, the Associated Press reported.",
      "The fire, and the subsequent water damage from firefighters attempting to stop the blaze, damaged key evidence in the case, the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time.",
      "After months of searching for a suspect, two men were arrested in Mexico in October 1992 after authorities said they confessed to the crime, the Houston Chronicle reported at the time.",
      "A few days later, the suspects recanted their confessions and said they were forced into signing their confessions, the Dallas Morning News reported.",
      "They were never charged in Mexico nor Texas in connection with the murders, according to the Dallas Morning News.",
      "The Austin American-Statesman reported in 1996 that despite thousands of leads and more than 30,000 hours of investigation, police had no primary suspects and the case remained unsolved, five years after the four girls were killed.",
      "Who Was Arrested in the 1991 Yogurt Shop Slayings?",
      "In August 1999, Austin Police announced they would be reopening their investigation into the murders, the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time.",
      "Kevin Buchman, a spokesperson for the Austin Police Department at the time, told the American-Statesman no new developments had occurred in the case, but a decline in homicides in the city that year allowed detectives to take another look at unsolved cases.",
      "Two months later, in October 1999, police announced they had arrested four men in connection with the murders, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Robert Burns Springsteen Jr., Michael James Scott, Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn were high schoolers at the time of the slayings and had been charged with capital murder, the AP reported. Pierce and Welborn were charged as juveniles because they were under 17 at the time of the slayings, per the Dallas Morning News.",
      "Police said Springsteen and Scott confessed they were involved in the crime and implicated Pierce and Welborn in their statements, the Austin American-Statesman reported. Pierce and Welborn had not made a confession in the crime.",
      "Later that month, police revealed they had no physical evidence linking Welborn and Pierce to the crime, though investigators had interviewed the pair several times, the Associated Press reported.",
      "All charges against Welborn were dropped in 2000 due to a lack of evidence, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Three years later, all charges against Pierce were dropped due to a lack of evidence, the Austin American-Statesman reported.",
      "Who Was Tried and Convicted for the Yogurt Shop Slayings?",
      "Springsteen was the first to stand trial in 2001, the Dallas Morning News reported at the time.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Springsteen had cased the I Can't Believe It's Yogurt store earlier in the day on Dec. 6, 1991, and returned with friends that night to rob the shop, according to the Morning News.",
      "The men forced the girls into a back room, where they were shot and killed, prosecutors said, according to the Morning News. Ayers managed to reach the door after being shot, and then was allegedly shot again with a different gun, prosecutors said, per the Morning News.",
      "Prosecutors also showed jurors a 1999 statement from Springsteen that they said included details of the crime that only the killer would know, the Morning News reported.",
      "Springsteen's defense attorney, Joe James Sawyer, told jurors during the trial his client's confession was coerced, and that police lied to him during their interrogation, the Morning News reported.",
      "After a three-week trial, jurors convicted Springsteen of capital murder for Ayers death, the Associated Press reported. He was sentenced to the death penalty in June 2001, according to the AP.",
      "Scott's trial began in 2002, in which he was also accused of killing Ayers, the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time.",
      "Prosecutors read Scott's eight-page confession to jurors, though Scott later recanted the confession, the American-Statesman reported.",
      "Scott's defense attorneys argued during the trial his confession included statements that didn't match crime scene evidence, according to the American-Statesman.",
      "After just under 24 hours of deliberation, jurors convicted Scott of capital murder in September 2002, according to the American-Statesman. He was sentenced to life in prison, the American-Statesman reported.",
      "Why Were Robert Springsteen's and Michael Scott's Convictions Overturned?",
      "After years of appeals, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ruled Springsteen and Scott were unfairly denied the chance to cross-examine each other, which violated their Sixth Amendment rights, and overturned their convictions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.",
      "Judge Mike Lynch later released the defen\u00addants on bond, pend\u00ading a pos\u00adsi\u00adble retri\u00adal by the state, according to the DPIC.",
      "In 2009, prosecutors admitted they were still not prepared to take the case to trial, and filed a motion for all charges against the two men to be dismissed, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Lynch approved the motion, dismissing the charges against Springsteen and Scott. The pair smiled and silently shook hands with each other in the courtroom, the AP reported.",
      "\u201cThis has been a long time coming,\u201d Scott told the AP. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d",
      "No one else has been accused of wrongdoing in the case since Springsteen's and Scott's convictions were overturned."

      "\"We try our best to wash our hands really well at home and hope that when they're at school, they wash their hands just as well,\" she explains, in an exclusive interview with TODAY.com. \"You're about to go to school, touch every surface and lick your hands. The cold that you are about to bring home is going to be 'peak school.'\"",
      "Despite the school germs that may come, Wyatt is such a \"social butterfly\" that Kylie is really looking forward to watching her build new relationships with her classmates. In true mom style, Kylie is feeling all the feelings about sending her daughter to school.",
      "\"When your kids leave you, you hope they're polite. You hope they use their manners. You hope they speak up for themselves. You hope they advocate for themselves. You hope that they're kind to their peers, their classmates and you hope that they're respectful of the teachers,\" she says.",
      "Body Confidence, The Kelce Way",

      "\"I was like, 'Oh my gosh, everyone's staring at me,'\" she remembers thinking when she had to stand up at school to receive the award for the Presidential Fitness Test. It was phased out of schools in 2013 but may be making a return.",
      "Though Kylie welcomes any opportunity to get kids moving, motherhood taught her that hitting milestones like rolling over and crawling (and doing chin-ups, for example) don't always happen at the same time for every body.",
      "\"None of our kids walked at the same time, none of our kids spoke at the same time, and so to hold everyone to the same exact standard just seems old school and silly,\" she says.",
      "\"But you know what?\" she continues. \"I think we can just all agree that if we can encourage our young kids to start moving and to be active and to get outside and to enjoy play and active play, that we're taking steps in the right direction.\""

      "The 2003 film begins with Tess trying several times to wake a reluctant Anna up for school. Similarly, the sequel opens with Anna attempting to wake her daughter, Harper, up. In the new movie, though, Harper is already up but snuck out to go surfing.",
      "Anna and Harper have a similarly tense mother-daughter relationship, while Tess is now the \u201ccool\u201d grandma.",
      "Dropping Harper off at school, Anna yells, \"Make good choices!\" an expression originally coined by Tess in the first film.",
      "An Oct. 3 Wedding",
      "Anna and Eric's wedding date in the film is Oct. 3, which is an iconic date for any \u201cMean Girls\u201d fans.",
      "In the 2004 movie, Lohan's character, Cady Heron is talking to her crush, Aaron Samuels, in math class. In the seemingly insignificant interaction, he asks her the date, and Cady's response has since served as a major quote from the film.",
      "\u201cOn October 3rd, he asked me what day it was,\u201d a voiceover of Lohan says in the film, giddy over her conversation with Aaron.",
      "Some now even deem Oct. 3 as \u201cMean Girls\u201d Day.",
      "The Earthquake Switches",
      "Just like in \"Freaky Friday,\" before the women swap bodies with one another in the sequel, they feel an earthquake. But when they observe the rest of the room, they appear to be the only ones who felt the shake.",
      "In \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Harper and Lily swap bodies with Anna and Tess, respectively. The teen girls \u2014 now in adult bodies as Lohan's and Curtis\u2019 characters \u2014 have a similar moment to the original film where they panic in a mirror at how \u201cold\u201d they look.",
      "Lohan and Curtis also recreate running into one another in an effort to switch back into their old bodies. But the teenagers \u2014 now Anna and Tess \u2014 tell the girls they tried that \"last time\" to no avail.",
      "A Nod to Meredith Blake From 'The Parent Trap'",
      "\u201cParent Trap\u201d fans will likely notice a familiar face in \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d: Elaine Hendrix, aka Meredith Blake.",
      "In the 1998 remake of \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d Lohan played twins Hallie and Annie. Hendrix portrayed Meredith, the unlikable fianc\u00e9 to the twins\u2019 dad.",
      "In \u201cFreakier Friday,\u201d Hendrix makes a cameo as Blake Kale, who works for a magazine featuring Anna\u2019s client, pop star Ella, who she manages at her record label job. In a nod to her \u201cParent Trap\u201d character, Hendrix addresses Anna as \u201cpuss,\u201d which she called the twins in the late \u201890s movie.",
      "\u2018Take Me Away,' Reprised",
      "In a big moment at the end of \"Freakier Friday,\" Anna has the chance to reclaim her rockstar days with the band Pink Slip, who fans were first introduced to in \u201cFreaky Friday.\u201d Though time has passed, the characters allude to Pink Slip becoming a popular rock band prior to Anna welcoming her daughter, Harper.",
      "While Harper is in her mother's body, the band reunites for Anna to perform a song she wrote.",
      "In the first film, Anna \u2014 while still in Tess\u2019 body \u2014 had to be on guitar backstage to cover for her mom being unable to play. In the sequel, Anna \u2014 now in Harper's body \u2014 has to cover for her daughter. This time, however, the mom and daughter share a sweet moment performing together.",
      "After the duet, the four characters fully understand one another enough to all switch back into their own bodies. After they do, Pink Slip \u2014 complete with Anna\u2019s former bandmates, Maddie (Christina Vidal) and Peg (Haley Hudson) \u2014 jam out to \u201cTake Me Away,\u201d which was made popular in the 2003 film.",
      "Bloopers in the Credits",
      "Similar to \"Freaky Friday,\" the credits for \"Freakier Friday\" feature a series of fun bloopers of the cast. The editing of the credits altogether appear to be a nod to the original film."

      "He went on to defend the proposed Gaza takeover, saying Israel had \u201cno choice\u201d but to \u201cfinish the job\u201d and \u201cdefeat Hamas,\u201d while claiming that \u201chundreds of aid trucks have gone into Gaza.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu said his goal was to rescue the remaining hostages and recover the remains of those who had died. Of the 50 hostages still being held by Hamas, Israel believes about 20 are alive.",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything, we are not going to get them out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe move I\u2019m talking about has the possibility of getting them out.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s remarks came as the United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting to discuss Israel\u2019s proposed offensive. The United States said at the meeting that Israel had the right to defend itself and to decide what is necessary for its security.",
      "The plan was condemned by other Western governments, as well as U.N. officials who said it would only deepen the suffering of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, where humanitarian aid has been limited since Israel lifted a 2\u00bd-month blockade in May.",
      "\u201cThis is no longer a looming hunger crisis \u2014 this is starvation, pure and simple,\u201d a U.N. humanitarian coordination official, Ramesh Rajasingham, told the council.",
      "The Gaza Health Ministry said Sunday that five more people, including two children, had died from malnutrition and starvation in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 217, including 100 children.",
      "The U.N. and other international organizations say the humanitarian aid arriving in Gaza through airdrops and on a small number of trucks is far from sufficient to feed the enclave\u2019s population of 2 million people.",
      "On Saturday, a 14-year-old boy named Muhannad Eid died after being struck by an aid package that was airdropped over Gaza, his brother, Muhammad Eid, said.",
      "\u201cThis is an aerial humiliation, not aid,\u201d Muhammad Eid said. \u201cWe need protection. We want international protection.\u201d",
      "With the latest death, 23 people have now been killed during aid drops since the Israel-Hamas war began 22 months ago, according to the Gaza government media office.",
      "\u201cWe have repeatedly warned of the danger of these inhumane methods and have repeatedly called for the safe and adequate entry of aid through land crossings,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "According to local health officials, more than 61,000 Palestinians, including thousands of children, have been killed since Israel began its military campaign Oct. 7, 2023, after Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on Israel. During that attack, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people and abducted 251 others.",
      "There is strong opposition in Israel to the expansion of Gaza military operations, with thousands of people calling for an immediate ceasefire at protests Saturday night in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and other Israeli cities.",
      "But for some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s coalition government, the plan isn\u2019t tough enough.",
      "Foreign Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who has pushed for Israel to impose sovereignty over Gaza, called it a \u201cfoolish\u201d half-measure, saying in a video message Saturday night that he did not support it.",
      "Smotrich said the proposed offensive was intended to pressure Hamas into agreeing to a temporary ceasefire, and that instead Israel needed a \u201csharp, clear path\u201d to victory over Hamas.",
      "The dissatisfaction expressed by Smotrich, who said he had \u201clost faith\u201d in the prime minister, threatens to destabilize Netanyahu\u2019s fragile coalition.",
      "Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid seized on the opportunity, calling on Smotrich to join him in advancing a bill to dissolve parliament and hold new elections.",
      "\u201cIn your own words, you admitted that the prime minister\u2019s policy is not leading to a decisive outcome in Gaza, is not returning our hostages, and is not winning the war,\u201d Lapid said in a statement, according to the Times of Israel. \u201cYou also added that you can no longer stand behind the prime minister and back him up.\u201d",
      "The plan outlines five goals for ending the war: Disarming Hamas, returning all hostages, demilitarizing Gaza, taking security control of the area, and establishing \u201can alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority.\u201d",
      "Those preparations are expected to take weeks or months, a delay that hard-liners in the Israeli government fear could leave room for a diplomatic solution that would undermine their objectives.",
      "Experts have questioned whether the plan would protect Israelis, or work at all.",
      "Michael Milshtein, head of the Palestinian Studies Forum at Tel Aviv University\u2019s Dayan Center, said it was full of \u201chollow slogans.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a very common slogan: \u2018We will release the hostages and defeat Hamas at the same time,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t do both simultaneously. Hamas will execute them, or the IDF itself could in the bombing.\u201d",
      "There are also questions as to who would run Gaza long term. Netanyahu said he intends to hand control of the territory to \u201cArab forces,\u201d adding Sunday that \u201cseveral candidates\u201d are being looked at for the establishment of a new \u201ctransitional authority.\u201d",
      "He has not specified who that could be, aside from saying it would not be Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.",
      "\u201cThat leaves nobody,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. \u201cNo Arab country is going to be Israel\u2019s enforcer on the ground.\u201d"

      "The solemn ritual marks the precise moment Aug. 6, 1945, when the U.S. bomber Enola Gay dropped the world\u2019s first atomic bomb over Hiroshima, killing about 70,000 people instantly.",
      "On Wednesday, people in Hiroshima commemorated the 80th anniversary of the devastating attack, as nuclear fears mount globally amid unresolved military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.",
      "In a one-minute silent tribute, the city remembered the widescale death and destruction caused by the 10,000-pound bomb, which created a huge mushroom cloud that rose to more than 60,000 feet.",
      "\u201cIt is our duty to convey the reality of the atomic bombings not only to the people of Japan but also to the people of the world,\u201d Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said in a speech.",
      "Initially meant to strike a T-shaped bridge, the bomb veered instead toward an exhibition hall with a distinctive dome, which after the explosion was the only building still standing within a 1-mile radius.",
      "The blast unleashed a whirlwind of fire and force, incinerating thousands of people. Then came the radioactive black rain, which fell over the city, silently poisoning countless more.",
      "Teruko Yahata was 8 years old at the time.",
      "Yahata, who is now in her 80s, says she still has a scar from when she was hurled by the blast. Fearing another bomb, she huddled under a blanket with her family.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really understand what it meant to die,\u201d Yahata said, \u201cbut the warmth I felt at us dying together \u2026 I still remember to this day.\u201d",
      "Three days after bombing Hiroshima, the U.S. unleashed a second atomic bomb on the city of Nagasaki that killed another 40,000 people immediately.",
      "The unprecedented bombings hastened Imperial Japan\u2019s surrender and the end of World War II, most historians say, though at the price of nearly a quarter-million lives.",
      "From the ashes, Hiroshima was rebuilt into a busy city of more than a million people, drawing tourists from around the world.",
      "Near the hypocenter, where the bomb detonated about 2,000 feet above, is a peace memorial park and museum that includes the iconic atomic dome. Using virtual reality headsets, visitors can immerse themselves in the bombing and its brutal aftermath while touring the park.",
      "Yet, the bombing still feels visceral to Hiroshima survivors, who are called hibakusha, or \u201cbomb affected persons.\u201d Now more than 86 years old on average, they have spent most of their lives struggling with illness, depression and discrimination.",
      "Kunihiko Iida, whose father was killed in the war and whose mother and older sister died shortly after the bombing, is now 83, defying predictions that he would not live to the age of 20.",
      "Those who say the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved lives, he said, \u201cdon\u2019t know the reality of a nuclear bomb.\u201d",

      "The increase in spending on nuclear weapons contrasts with public attitudes about them. In a June survey of Americans by the Pew Research Center, 69% of respondents said the development of nuclear weapons had made the world less safe, compared with 10% who said it had made the world safer.",
      "Nearly 70% of Japan\u2019s atomic bomb survivors believe nuclear weapons could be used again, according to a poll this year by Japanese news agency Kyodo News.",
      "Hiroshima survivor Setsuko Thurlow, 93, lost 10 members of her family in the bombing. She said she remembered seeing a procession of people fleeing to the hillside who \u201clooked like ghosts.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s hair was just standing up, raised upwards, and the skin and the flesh was coming off from the bones,\u201d she said.",
      "Thurlow, who went to the U.S. to study in 1954 \u2014 the same year the U.S. tested a hydrogen bomb 1,000 times more powerful than the one that destroyed Hiroshima \u2014 has spent her life campaigning for nuclear disarmament, accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 on behalf of ICAN.",
      "\u201cI beg world leaders to stop and come to the negotiation table. Diplomacy needs to have greater attention,\u201d she said in a video interview from Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s not nuclear weapons, but diplomacy, exchange of words and ideas.\u201d",
      "The number of hibakusha is dwindling, raising fears that living memory of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings will soon be gone. As of the end of March, there were 99,130 survivors nationwide, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.",
      "Responsibility for remembering is being taken up by young people such as 12-year-old Shun Sasaki, who has been giving foreign visitors free guided tours of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park since he was 7.",

      "Here\u2019s what to know about the meteorite and the legal dispute:",
      "How it was found",

      "It was discovered in the Sahara in northwestern Niger by a meteorite hunter in November 2023, according to the auction house. His identity was not disclosed. Nor was the identity of the buyer last month.",
      "Meteorite hunting is growing in arid Saharan countries like Niger. Though meteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery in part due to the favorable climate for their preservation.",
      "Hunters often search for space rocks that can be sold to collectors or scientists. The rarest and most precious are from Mars and the moon.",
      "According to the Heritage academic journal, the rock was sold to an international dealer before it ended up in a private galley in Italy. A team of scientists from the University of Florence examined the rock last year to learn more about its structure and where it came from before falling to Earth, the publication said.",
      "The meteorite was also briefly on display in Rome before it was next seen in public in New York last month during the auction.",

      "\u201cThe answer to Ukraine\u2019s territorial question is already in the constitution of Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a message on Telegram early Saturday. \u201cNo one will and no one can deviate from it. Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d",
      "His comments came after Trump announced on Truth Social that a long-awaited meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin had been scheduled for next Friday in Alaska.",
      "Further details and logistics of the meeting are still unclear and remain very fluid, including whether Zelenskyy will be involved. Trump did not mention the Ukrainian president in the post announcing the meeting with Putin.",
      "Later Friday, at the White House, Trump suggested that there have been talks about Russia and Ukraine potentially \u201cswapping\u201d territory as part of a ceasefire deal. \u201cThere\u2019ll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both and ... we\u2019ll be talking about that either later or tomorrow, or whatever.\u201d",
      "A White House official also said Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire in Ukraine, and that the U.S. is trying to get buy-in from Ukrainians and European allies.",
      "But in his message Saturday, Zelenskyy said any decisions taken without Ukraine were \u201cdecisions against peace,\u201d adding, \u201cThey will not achieve anything.\u201d",
      "The White House had not commented on Zelenskyy\u2019s message by early Saturday.",

      "It remains unclear whether Trump\u2019s reference to \u201cswapping\u201d territories means formal cession of land or a withdrawal from areas currently under each side\u2019s control.",
      "Zelenskyy and Ukrainian officials have long said they would not concede any territory that Russia illegally annexed. Ukraine has also insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",
      "Zelenskyy later spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron said on X that he had a long conversation with the Ukrainian president and with \u201cseveral European leaders,\u201d and reiterated his support for a ceasefire.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, who is visiting the United Kingdom, on Saturday met with U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy and a group of leaders from Ukraine and other European nations.",
      "In a post on X, Vance wrote that the conversation was \u201cto discuss a route to peace in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine,\u201d but included no further details on the ceasefire negotiations.",
      "According to a senior U.S. official familiar with the negotiations, Ukrainian government officials discussed with the U.S. tenets of a potential counterproposal to the Russian proposal put forward earlier this week to end the war.",
      "The meeting with Vance included Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, as well as Lammy. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoys Steve Witkoff and Keith Kellogg participated virtually, according to the official.",
      "The official called Saturday\u2019s meeting \u201cproductive\u201d and noted that there were discussions over potential security guarantees sought by Ukraine as part of any possible peace deal. Notably, the U.S. official denied that NATO membership was discussed as part of the counter initiative.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re productive, because it keeps the dialogue going,\u201d the senior official said, adding: \u201cEverybody was candid for comments, which, I thought, are important.\u201d",

      "The meeting in Alaska will be Trump and Putin\u2019s first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine, the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War II, and comes after the relationship between the two leaders has wavered.",

      "But after promising to solve the conflict within 24 hours during his presidential campaign, Trump has since extended that deadline and has expressed his frustration at the Russian president\u2019s seeming unwillingness to end the war.",
      "Trump had threatened to impose new sanctions and tariffs starting Friday against Moscow and countries that buy its exports unless Putin agreed to end the conflict. It was unclear by Saturday morning whether those sanctions would take effect or be delayed or canceled.",
      "Trump\u2019s ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch in its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give the president a meeting.",
      "Although Trump\u2019s agreement to a meeting suggested a chance for progress, it was far from certain anything substantial would be achieved, Peter Watkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, told NBC News on Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe underlying issues have not changed,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Russia, this isn\u2019t just about territory. It\u2019s about controlling Ukraine as a whole.\u201d He also noted that Trump would most likely want to leave the summit with something to show for it, but the outcome might be only \u201canother step\u201d in a protracted process rather than a decisive deal.",
      "Promises of talks between Trump and Putin have done little to quiet the violence on the ground since their announcement.",
      "On the ground, the Kremlin\u2019s larger army is slowly advancing deeper into Ukraine at a great cost in troops while it relentlessly bombards Ukrainian cities.",
      "Overnight, Russian drone strikes hit a minibus in a suburb of Kherson, killing two and leaving six injured, the region\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office said Saturday.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s Air Force Command said Saturday that Russia launched 47 drone strikes overnight in multiple Ukrainian regions, with 31 of them making landfall."

      "A growing number of U.S. politicians are condemning a new British law that requires some websites and apps \u2014 including some based in the United States \u2014 to check the ages of users across the pond.",
      "A bipartisan group of members of Congress visited London recently to meet counterparts and air their concerns about the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, which went into effect July 25. Vice President JD Vance has been criticizing the law for months, as have privacy advocates who argue that the law infringes on free expression and disproportionately hurts vulnerable groups.",
      "Vance criticized the U.K. again on Friday, this time in person at the start of a visit to the country. Sitting alongside British Foreign Secretary David Lammy and speaking to reporters, Vance warned the U.K. against going down a \u201cvery dark path\u201d of online \u201ccensorship\u201d that he said was trod earlier by the Biden administration.",
      "The U.K. Online Safety Act is aimed at preventing children from accessing potentially harmful material online, and internet companies are now asking British users to verify their ages in a variety of ways, including with photos of their IDs, through a credit card provider or with selfies analyzed via age-check software.",
      "But the sweeping nature of the law has caught some Britons by surprise. They\u2019re being asked to prove their age not only for pornography websites but also before they can listen to songs with explicit lyrics or access message boards to discuss sensitive subjects. Reddit, for example, is restricting access to various pages including r/stopsmoking, r/STD and r/aljazeera.",
      "Reddit said in a post about its enforcement of the law that for people in the U.K., it was now verifying ages before they can \u201cview certain mature content.\u201d A spokesperson for the company said r/STD \u2014 a message board focused on questions of sexual health \u2014 is restricted because of explicit images. They said r/stopsmoking is restricted because it deals with harmful substances and that r/aljazeera \u2014 which is not affiliated with the news organization of the same name but deals with similar topics \u2014 is restricted because it depicts serious injury or violence.",
      "To get around the new law, the use of virtual private network software that can mask a person\u2019s location, also known as VPNs, has surged in the U.K.",
      "The primary argument of U.S. politicians who oppose the law is that they don\u2019t want American tech companies to have to comply, even if they\u2019re serving British customers.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said he raised his objections with U.K. government officials during meetings in London at the end of July. In a statement after his return, he said the law and other European regulations \u201ccreate a serious chilling effect on free expression and threaten the First Amendment rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need to protect children and keep harmful, illegal content off these platforms \u2014 but when governments or bureaucracies suppress speech in the name of safety or regulation, it sets a dangerous precedent that threatens the core of Western democratic values,\u201d Jordan said.",
      "The issue may come to a head in a couple of different venues. That could be the courts if any tech companies file lawsuits over the law, or it could come up in trade negotiations if President Donald Trump decides to press the issue with British politicians, although they say it\u2019s not open to debate in trade talks.",
      "Marc Andreessen, a venture capitalist and Meta board member with close ties to the Trump administration, recently called U.K. leaders to complain about the law, the Financial Times reported Friday. A spokesperson for Andreessen said the report was not true.",
      "The U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act is one of the most comprehensive national laws that any democracy has ever passed to try to curtail potentially harmful content online in the name of children. Parliament passed the law in 2023, and the government went through two years of writing detailed rules before putting the law into effect last month.",
      "The law is notable for a combination of reasons: the variety of content it applies to, the potential fines and the possible international reach.",
      "A wide array of content is at issue. While the \u201cprimary\u201d focus of the law is online material such as pornography and suicide, it also requires websites to age-gate content with bullying, serious violence, \u201cdangerous stunts\u201d and \u201cexposure to harmful substances.\u201d That has covered relatively mainstream services such as Spotify and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox gaming system.",
      "Companies that don\u2019t comply face potential fines of up to 10% of their global revenue, which for the biggest companies could be billions of dollars. The British regulator Ofcom, short for Office of Communications, says companies must use \u201chighly effective age assurance\u201d to restrict the riskiest types of content.",
      "And the U.K. has not been adamant that it won\u2019t allow international borders to stymie enforcement. Ofcom says it plans to apply the law to services with \u201ca significant number\u201d of U.K. users, services where U.K. users \u201care a target market\u201d and services that are \u201ccapable of being accessed\u201d by U.K. users with a \u201cmaterial risk of significant harm\u201d to such users.",
      "The law appears to retain strong support among the British public. About 69% said they supported the new rules in a YouGov poll taken after implementation began, and 46% said they supported it \u201cstrongly.\u201d But 52% said they do not think the law will be very effective at preventing minors from accessing pornography.",
      "The law was passed during a previous, Conservative-led government and took effect under the current, Labour-led government.",
      "But the far-right party Reform U.K. is pushing for a repeal of the law. Party leader Nigel Farage, a former member of Parliament, has called it \u201cstate suppression of genuine free speech,\u201d and his party is running high in polls.",
      "\u201cMillions of people have noticed that what they\u2019re getting on their feeds is different to what it was,\u201d Farage said at a recent news conference.",
      "Farage also met with visiting members of Congress last week, and the talks turned heated with Farage and Democrats exchanging insults, according to Politico, although the dispute appeared to be more about Trump\u2019s free speech restrictions than about the U.K. law.",
      "Most U.S.-based tech companies say they are complying with the new law. Microsoft said in a blog post that Xbox users in the U.K. would begin seeing notifications \u201cencouraging them to verify their age\u201d as a \u201cone-time process,\u201d with actual enforcement starting next year. If users don\u2019t comply, Microsoft warned, they\u2019ll lose access to social features of Xbox but will still be able to play games.",
      "Discord said it was implementing new default settings for all U.K. users, in effect treating everyone like a minor with heavy content filtering unless they verify that they\u2019re adults. Discord says users can choose to verify their age either with a face scan or an ID upload.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has also restricted posts, including information about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, according to the BBC. X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "But a few services are not complying. The far-right social media site Gab, which allows white supremacist views and other extremist content, said in a notice on its website that it had received notices from Ofcom and, rather than comply, decided to block the entire U.K. from accessing its site. The company said in the notice: \u201cWe refuse to comply with this tyranny.\u201d",
      "Preston Byrne, a U.S. lawyer who specializes in technology issues, has said on X that he plans to file a lawsuit soon on behalf of an unnamed client seeking to quash possible enforcement of the British law within the United States.",
      "The subject has been simmering for months ahead of the law\u2019s implementation, and it came up in February when British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the White House.",
      "In an Oval Office meeting, a reporter asked Trump what he thought of the U.K. approach to free speech, and Trump tossed the question to Vance, who expressed concern.",
      "\u201cWe do have, of course, a special relationship with our friends in the U.K. and also with some of our European allies. But we also know that there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British \u2014 of course, what the British do in their own country is up to them \u2014 but also affect American technology companies and, by extension, American citizens,\u201d he said.",
      "Starmer defended his government\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom, and it will last for a very, very long time. Certainly, we wouldn\u2019t want to reach across U.S. systems and we don\u2019t, and that\u2019s absolutely right,\u201d he said.",
      "British Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy later said the U.K. would not make any changes to the Online Safety Act as part of trade negotiations with the Trump administration.",
      "American privacy advocates are watching the debate play out with alarm, concerned that similar age verification laws \u2014 like new state laws targeting the Apple and Google app stores \u2014 would upend the internet closer to home.",
      "\u201cYoung people should be able to access information, speak to each other and to the world, play games, and express themselves online without the government making decisions about what speech is permissible,\u201d wrote Paige Collings, a senior speech and privacy activist at the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation, in a blog post Tuesday."

      "But with mounting international outrage about deaths from starvation in Gaza under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions, several countries have started dropping food, medicine and other supplies into Gaza from the sky.",
      "\u201cThose aid drops are actually causing havoc,\u201d Dr. Umar Burney, a Texas-based orthopedic surgeon volunteering in Gaza, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday from the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in northern Gaza. Multiple explosions could be heard ringing out nearby as he spoke.",
      "Burney, who has been treating patients in Gaza for the past week, added that he had taken care of \u201cmultiple patients who\u2019ve been crushed by these sort of unplanned, unannounced aid drops on top of their heads, literally on top of their heads.\u201d",
      "Saturday\u2019s flight from an air base just outside the Jordanian capital Amman took place a day after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government faced a wave of condemnation from European leaders, Arab nations and a group representing the families of hostages after it announced plans to take control of Gaza City in the north of the enclave.",
      "United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned the plan on Friday as a \u201cdangerous escalation\u201d that risks \u201cdeepening the already catastrophic consequences for millions of Palestinians.\u201d",

      "Deaths from starvation in Gaza have been on the rise after Israel launched a crippling blockade barring the entry of food and other vital supplies into the enclave in early March before ending its ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "It lifted the blockade in May, allowing a basic amount of aid into Gaza, largely distributed under a controversial new distribution system led by the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Since then, nearly 1,400 people have been killed and more than 4,000 injured while seeking food, the United Nations\u2019 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in an update Tuesday. \u201cAt least 859 people have been killed around GHF sites since the beginning of GHF\u2019s operations,\u201d it added.",
      "Asked to address the rising death toll by NBC News on Wednesday, GHF said aid convoys belonging to the United Nations and other organizations in the past often passed near these locations and were regularly looted by large crowds.",
      "The Israeli military said in a statement Saturday that it allows GHF to \u201cdistribute aid to Gaza residents independently.\u201d It said that after \u201cincidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted\u201d and that \u201csystematic learning processes\u201d to improve the operational response are underway.",
      "Faced with mounting global outrage, Israel began tactical pauses in some parts of Gaza to allow more aid into the enclave late last month. It also began to allow countries to airdrop supplies into the territory, although aid groups have criticized this method of delivery.",
      "\u201cThese air drops are falling in extremely populated areas. They\u2019re dangerous,\u201d Caroline Willemen, a project coordinator at a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) clinic in Gaza City, told British broadcaster Sky News on Saturday. \u201cThey have fallen on tents, people have been injured,\" she added.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the Ukraine war is one of the biggest gambits of his second term.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 An unkept promise of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is that he\u2019d end the war between Russia and Ukraine in one swift diplomatic masterstroke.",
      "Trump made threats. He applied pressure. Still, the bombs keep falling, the casualties continue to pile up.",
      "Now, Trump is betting that a face-to-face meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin will yield the elusive breakthrough and possibly quell concerns among voters about his handling of the war.",
      "The summit taking place Friday on friendly turf, the red state of Alaska, amounts to one of the biggest gambits of Trump\u2019s second term. Hosting the meeting raises expectations that he\u2019ll stop the fighting. The president faces traps in sitting down with Putin, who is well-versed in the territorial issues at stake, but he also enjoys economic and military leverage. Creating a durable peace that will preserve Ukraine\u2019s independence will test the dealmaking skills that are Trump\u2019s point of pride.",
      "\u201cIf you roll into the meeting not prepped, you can get jammed by Putin,\u201d said Michael McFaul, who was U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration. \u201cSummits are to achieve an objective that advances American national interests. They\u2019re the means to end, and I sometimes feel that Trump feels the meeting is an end in itself.\u201d",
      "Inside the Trump administration, a national security official acknowledged that forging a peace accord won\u2019t be easy. One of the combatants won\u2019t be at the table: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has refused to relinquish territory to Russia that was illegally annexed.",
      "\u201cWhether or not there\u2019s a breakthrough in the next week or two, we\u2019ll find out,\u201d said the Trump administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cUltimately, Putin and Zelenskyy have to be able to agree on something fundamentally. Third parties can do anything they want, but these two men have to agree to things.\u201d",
      "Sitting in a room with Putin, a canny negotiator in his own right, Trump may be lured into endorsing a peace deal that carves up Ukraine, foreign policy experts caution.",
      "\u201cI worry that in the eagerness to look like a peacemaker, President Trump will say, \u2018Yeah, that sounds like a good idea to me,\u2019\u201d McFaul said. \u201cPutin will say, \u2018Donetsk [a city in eastern Ukraine] was always part of Russia.\u2019 And Trump will say, \u2018You\u2019re right about that.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cPutin is good at those stories,\u201d McFaul continued. \u201cHe knows his history, and he can be engaging in his narrative. That\u2019s what the president needs to be ready for and his team needs to get him ready for.\u201d",
      "Another possibility is that Putin tries to stall the president further, promising concessions he has no intention of making in hopes of consolidating gains on the battlefield, one former U.S. official said.",
      "Putin may try to \u201cdivert President Trump from Trump\u2019s goal of stopping the war and establishing a ceasefire by promising things later,\u201d said William Taylor, who was charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine during Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cThen, Putin continues to fight and continues to kill Ukrainians.\u201d",
      "No matter the outcome, Putin comes away with at least a symbolic victory: He\u2019s getting a large, bright stage at a time when he\u2019s an international pariah. Two years ago, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin, accusing him of war crimes involving the abduction of Ukrainian children. The warrant substantially limited potential locations for the two world leaders to meet.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump \u2014 just by going to a meeting with Putin, who for most of the democratic world is a rogue, imperialist dictator \u2014 is giving him legitimacy,\u201d McFaul said.",
      "The summit will inevitably invite comparisons to one held in Helsinki in 2018.",
      "At a joint news conference with Putin that year, Trump came off as eager to forge a personal connection after years of icy bilateral relations between the U.S. and Russia. Citing Putin\u2019s denial of interfering in the 2016 presidential race, Trump said at the time: \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why it would be\u201d Russia that meddled in his victory over Hillary Clinton that year. (He later claimed he had misspoken, affirming that he believed the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion that Russian meddling had occurred but added that there \u201ccould be other people also\u201d who interfered in the 2016 election.)",
      "This time around, Trump is more seasoned and has grown impatient with Putin\u2019s conduct of the war. He has suggested that his wife, Melania Trump, has influenced his view of Putin, reminding him of the damage that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine.",
      "For his part, Putin is more diminished. As of this summer, Russian casualties were expected to hit 1 million. If he chooses, Trump could punish Russia for prolonging the war by slapping secondary sanctions on countries that purchase Russian energy, a step he has threatened to take.",
      "\u201cTrump is in a stronger position this time than in that first meeting,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIf President Trump goes into the meeting with Putin and exercises the political, military and economic leverage that he\u2019s got, there could be a ceasefire.\u201d",
      "Trump heads into the summit facing difficulties at home. His administration has struggled to stem the backlash from his base over the Jeffrey Epstein case. Last week, Trump fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following a hiring report that showed weak job growth.",
      "A recent poll from the University of Massachusetts Amherst showed that Trump\u2019s approval rating was 38% \u2014 a 6-point drop from April.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s pretty close to the theoretical floor in this polarized era for approval ratings,\u201d said Alexander Theodoridis, director of the poll.",
      "Among Trump voters, support for his handling of the Russia-Ukraine war stood at 64% compared with other issues on which they approved of his performance by significantly higher margins, Theodoridis said. A total of 85% of Trump\u2019s 2024 voters approved of his performance on immigration issues; 78% favored his work on jobs; and 71% on tariffs.",
      "Statecraft is a proven way for presidents to improve their standing at home. A commander in chief enjoys far more latitude in shaping events in the foreign policy arena than when it comes to domestic affairs.",
      "The summit, said Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, \u201cwill change the subject in a positive way for Trump if he actually stands up to Putin and demands a just peace for Ukraine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat would be a positive diversion,\u201d Coons added. \u201cBut it would be the worst of both worlds if it [the summit] is intended both to be a diversion from the domestic focus on things like tariffs and Epstein, and he fails to be strong.\u201d",
      "An added incentive for Trump to end the conflict could be an award that he seems to covet. His White House appears to be methodically building a case that he has earned the Nobel Peace Prize, drawing attention to various efforts to reduce tensions in global hot spots.",
      "Jan. 31 is the deadline for nominating candidates for the 2026 prize. The Nobel selection committee will announce the winner in October of that year.",
      "On Friday, Trump held a ceremony in the White House to mark a U.S.-brokered accord ending hostilities between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Questioned by reporters, the leaders of both countries touted Trump\u2019s candidacy for a prize that three other American presidents have won. Barack Obama was the most recent winner, in 2009.",
      "Still, the peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan would be merely an amuse-bouche compared with ending the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, a nuclear-armed power.",
      "\u201cPutin is clearly in a weaker position,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis invasion of Ukraine has turned out to be a disaster for him. And Trump has the cards this time. He\u2019s got leverage, experience and confidence. He\u2019s eager to solve this problem and end the war. He sees that Putin is the problem. Putin is standing between him and the end of the war.\u201d"

      "NAGASAKI, Japan \u2014 Nagasaki is marking the U.S. atomic attack on the southern Japanese city 80 years ago and survivors of the attack are working to make their hometown the last place on earth hit by the bomb.",
      "Despite their pain from wounds, discrimination and illnesses from radiation, survivors have publicly committed to a shared goal of abolishing nuclear weapons. But recently they worry about the world moving in the opposite direction as the anniversary is commemorated Saturday.",
      "The atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killed some 70,000 people, three days after the bombing of Hiroshima killed 140,000. Japan surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II and the country\u2019s nearly half-century of aggression across Asia.",
      "Aging survivors and their supporters in Nagasaki now put their hopes of achieving nuclear weapons abolition in the hands of younger people, telling them the attack is not distant history, but an issue that remains relevant to their future.",
      "Teruko Yokoyama, an 83-year-old member of a Nagasaki organization supporting survivors, said she feels the absence of those she has worked, which fuels her strong desire to document the lives of remaining survivors.",
      "The number of survivors has fallen to 99,130, about a quarter of the original number, with their average age exceeding 86. Survivors worry about fading memories, as the youngest of the survivors were too young to recall the attack clearly.",
      "\u201cWe must keep records of the atomic bombing damages of the survivors and their lifetime story,\u201d said Yokoyama, whose two sisters died after suffering illnesses linked to radiation.",
      "Her organization has started to digitalize the narratives of survivors for viewing on YouTube and other social media platforms with the help of a new generation.",
      "\u201cThere are younger people who are beginning to take action,\u201d Yokoyama told The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cSo I think we don\u2019t have to get depressed yet.\u201d",
      "Nagasaki hosted a \u201cpeace forum\u201d on Friday where survivors shared their stories with more than 300 young people from around the country. Seiichiro Mise, a 90-year-old survivor, said he is handing seeds of \u201cflowers of peace\u201d to the younger generation in hopes of seeing them bloom.",
      "On Saturday at 11:02 a.m., the moment the plutonium bomb exploded above Nagasaki, participants are to set to observe a moment of silence as a peace bell rings.",
      "About 3,000 people, including representatives from 95 countries, were expected to attend the event at Nagasaki Peace Park, where Mayor Shiro Suzuki and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba were scheduled to speak.",
      "The twin bells at Urakami Cathedral, which was destroyed in the bombing, are to ring together again for the first time. One of the bells had gone missing afer the attack but was restored by volunteers.",
      "Survivors and their families started paying tribute at the park, as well as at the nearby hypocenter park, hours before the official ceremony.",
      "Survivors are frustrated by a growing nuclear threat and support among international leaders for developing or possessing nuclear weapons for deterrence. They criticize the Japanese government\u2019s refusal to sign or even participate in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons because Japan, as an American ally, needs U.S. nuclear possession as deterrence.",
      "Nagasaki invited representatives from all countries to attend the ceremony on Saturday. China notably notified the city it would not be present without providing a reason.",
      "The ceremony last year stirred controversy due to the absence of the U.S. ambassador and other Western envoys in response to the Japanese city\u2019s refusal to invite Israel."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan shook hands Friday at a White House peace summit before signing an agreement aimed at ending decades of conflict.",
      "President Donald Trump was in the middle as Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan flanked him on either side. As the two extended their arms in front of Trump to shake hands, the U.S. leader reached up and clasped his hands around theirs.",
      "The two countries in the South Caucasus signed agreements with each other and the U.S. that will reopen key transportation routes while allowing the U.S. to seize on Russia\u2019s declining influence in the region. The deal includes an agreement that will create a major transit corridor to be named the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity, the White House said.",
      "Trump said at the White House on Friday that naming the route after him was \u201ca great honor for me\u201d but \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for this.\u201d A senior administration official, on a call before the event with reporters, said it was the Armenians who suggested the name.",
      "Trump has sought to be known as a peacemaker and made no secret of the fact that he covets a Nobel Peace Prize. Friday\u2019s signing adds to a series of peace and economic agreements brokered by the U.S. this year.",
      "Both leaders said the breakthrough was made possible by Trump and his team.",
      "\u201cWe are laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past,\u201d Pashinyan said, calling the agreement a \u201csignificant milestone.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump in six months did a miracle,\u201d Aliyev said.",
      "Trump remarked on how long the conflict went on between the two countries. \u201cThirty-five years they fought, and now they\u2019re friends and they\u2019re going to be friends a long time,\u201d he said.",
      "That route will connect Azerbaijan and its autonomous Nakhchivan exclave, which are separated by a 32-kilometer-wide (20-mile-wide) patch of Armenian territory. The demand from Azerbaijan had held up peace talks in the past.",
      "For Azerbaijan, a major producer of oil and gas, the route also provides a more direct link to Turkey and onward to Europe.",
      "Trump indicated he\u2019d like to visit the route, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to get over there.\u201d",
      "Asked how he feels about lasting peace between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Trump said \u201cvery confident.\u201d",
      "Aliyev and Pashinyan on Friday joined a growing list of foreign leaders and other officials who have said Trump should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in helping ease long-running conflicts across the globe.",
      "The peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda helped end the decades-long conflict in eastern Congo, and the U.S. mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, while Trump intervened in clashes between Cambodia and Thailand by threatening to withhold trade agreements with both countries if their fighting continued. Yet peace deals in Gaza and Ukraine have been elusive.",
      "US takes advantage of Russia\u2019s waning influence",
      "The signing of a deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, both former Soviet republics, also strikes a geopolitical blow to their former imperial master, Russia. Throughout the nearly four-decade conflict, Moscow played mediator to expand its clout in the strategic South Caucasus region, but its influence waned quickly after it launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Trump-brokered deal would allow the U.S. to deepen its reach in the region as Moscow retreats, senior U.S. administration officials said.",
      "The Trump administration began engaging with Armenia and Azerbaijan in earnest earlier this year, when Trump\u2019s key diplomatic envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Aliyev in Baku and started to discuss what a senior administration official called a \u201cregional reset.\u201d",
      "Negotiations over who will develop the Trump Route \u2014 which will eventually include a rail line, oil and gas pipelines, and fiber optic lines \u2014 will likely begin next week, and at least nine developers have expressed interest already, according to the senior administration official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.",
      "Separate from the joint agreement, both Armenia and Azerbaijan signed deals with the United States meant to bolster cooperation in energy, technology and the economy, the White House said.",
      "Trump previewed much of Friday\u2019s plan in a social media post Thursday evening, in which he said the agreements would \u201cfully unlock the potential\u201d of the South Caucasus region.",
      "\u201cMany Leaders have tried to end the War, with no success, until now, thanks to \u2018TRUMP,\u2019\u201d Trump said on his Truth Social site.",
      "The Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict has lasted for decades",
      "The two nations were locked in conflict for nearly four decades as they fought for control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh.",
      "The area was largely populated by Armenians during the Soviet era but is located within Azerbaijan. The two nations battled for control of the region through multiple violent clashes that left tens of thousands of people dead over the decades, all while international mediation efforts failed.",
      "Most recently, Azerbaijan reclaimed all of Karabakh in 2023 and had been in talks with Armenia to normalize ties. Azerbaijan\u2019s insistence on a land bridge to Nakhchivan had been a major sticking point, because while Azerbaijan did not trust Armenia to control the so-called Zangezur corridor, Armenia resisted control by a third party because it viewed it as a breach of sovereignty.",
      "But the prospect of closer ties with the United States, as well as being able to move in and out of the landlocked nation more freely without having to access Georgia or Iran, helped entice Armenia on the broader agreement, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia stood back when Azerbaijan reclaimed control of Karabakh in the September 2023 offensive, angering Armenia, which has moved to shed Russian influence and turn westward. Azerbaijan, emboldened by its victory in Karabakh, also has become increasingly defiant in its relations with Moscow."

    "summary": "Israel\u2019s plan to take control of Gaza City and hand control of the enclave to \u201cArab forces\u201d has drawn condemnation by Western governments and former officials.",
    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s plan to seize Gaza City and hand control of the enclave to unspecified \u201cArab forces\u201d has not only drawn condemnation by Western governments and aid agencies \u2014 some former officials and experts inside Israel say it would be unworkable.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet voted early on Friday for a plan to capture the city in the north of the enclave, one of the few places inside the strip that the Israeli military does not control, while distributing aid to civilians outside combat zones.",
      "The five-point plan \u201cfor concluding the war\u201d calls for the disarming of Hamas, the return of all hostages and the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip, which would be under Israeli security control. It also proposes that a government is established in Gaza that involves neither Islamist militants from Hamas, who have ruled the enclave since 2007, or the Palestinian Authority, the more secular governing body that has overseen parts of the occupied West Bank since the mid-1990s and is internationally recognized.",
      "The basics of the plan are likely unfeasible because it relies on cooperation from Arab states that have explicitly said they will not do so under these terms, according to Giora Eiland, a retired Israeli major general and former head of the country\u2019s National Security Council.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know whether Netanyahu has any real basis to what he said, whether he has any communication with other countries about the future of Gaza,\u201d Eiland told NBC News in a telephone interview Friday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid that his statement\u201d \u2014 about Arab nations being given control of Gaza \u2014 \u201chas no real, reliable basis behind it.\u201d",
      "Arab states such as Egypt and Jordan have \u201cclearly indicated time and again\u201d that a precondition for their involvement would be that the Palestinian Authority becomes a \u201cleading actor\u201d in Gaza\u2019s future governance, said Nimrod Goren, president of the Mitvim Institute, an Israeli think tank.",
      "Netanyahu had suggested earlier in the war that, rather than the Palestinian Authority or Hamas, he wanted Palestinian \u201cclans\u201d to take control of the enclave, and indeed he confirmed in June that Israel was arming such groups.",
      "But his hopes of these \u201cclans taking over Gaza haven\u2019t materialized, and aren\u2019t expected to,\u201d said Goren, who is also an executive board member at Diplomeds, or the Council for Mediterranean Diplomacy, a policy group based in the Netherlands.",
      "Ultimately, \u201cthe plan approved by the Israeli cabinet is damaging for Israel\u2019s national security and foreign policy. It is also unrealistic in terms of its end game,\u201d Goren added. All of this reinforces the \u201ccommon perception in Israel that Netanyahu is acting due to his own political needs, rather than the national good and concern for the Israeli hostages,\u201d he said.",
      "NBC News has contacted Netanyahu\u2019s office for a response to these criticisms.",
      "International outcry",
      "Israel\u2019s plan has been met with outcry internationally, with the United Nations and some Western governments warning it would lead to further catastrophe for Palestinians in Gaza, more than 61,000 of whom have been killed in the 22 months of war with Israel.",
      "Large parts of Gaza\u2019s population have been regularly displaced since Israel launched its offensive following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed in Israel and around 250 taken hostage. Crippling aid restrictions in recent months have caused the spiraling hunger crisis in Gaza, the United Nations and aid groups have said.",
      "Voices inside Israel have been similarly alarmed by the plan, with the families of hostages and even Israel\u2019s own armed forces chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, warning it will lead to the deaths of the remaining captives inside the enclave.",
      "Aerial photographs this week showed the utter devastation in the enclave, while Israel\u2019s overhauled aid distribution plan has fueled more chaos and hunger.",
      "Eiland, the retired Israeli general, supports the war, like the majority of the country\u2019s population. Nevertheless, he said he disagreed with Netanyahu\u2019s plan because he thinks most of the hostages \u201cwill perish\u201d and the Israeli army would \u201csuffer many casualties.\u201d",
      "Even if Israel managed to somehow execute its plan, \u201cwe will not change anything in the approach of Hamas,\u201d Eiland added. \u201cOn the contrary, it will just give them justification to continuing their guerrilla war against us.\u201d"

      "Just when Ukraine and its European allies thought President Donald Trump was coming round to their view of the war, he appeared to give a huge win to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin.",
      "For Kyiv, this was Trump\u2019s deadline to Putin: stop the fighting by Friday or face tough new economic sanctions. Instead, Trump has handed Moscow a diplomatic coup by agreeing to meet Putin face-to-face in a matter of days, their first encounter since the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Trump had initially suggested that such a summit would only go ahead if Putin agreed to meet with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, something the Ukrainian president\u2019s administration has long called for but has been resisted by Russia. On Thursday, Trump dispelled the idea that they would have to get together \u2014 raising the specter of a bilateral negotiation that freezes out Kyiv.",
      "\u201cThe danger for Ukraine is actually quite grave,\u201d said Jonathan Eyal, international director at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. \u201cThere will be a sense of alarm in European capitals.\u201d",
      "For Eyal and others, Ukraine\u2019s nightmare is now one step closer to reality: \u201cTrump will be so pleased by what he perceives as the great achievement of getting Putin to the negotiating table, that he grabs any kind of offer that is made,\u201d, Eyal said. \u201cThe danger of half-baked compromise, which Trump can claim as his main achievement, is very high.\u201d",
      "That compromise could be a temporary ceasefire that would allow Russia to restock its army and give its economy a break from international sanctions, according to Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization based in Roseland, New Jersey.",
      "Even if there is no truce agreement, \u201ca meeting with Trump \u2014 no matter the outcome \u2014 would be a big diplomatic victory for Putin,\u201d Yuriy Boyechko, Hope for Ukraine\u2019s CEO, said in an email. \u201cPutin wants to break his diplomatic isolation\u201d and such a meeting \u201cwill stroke his ego.\u201d",
      "The \u201cmeeting with Putin is a trap; President Trump must not fall for it,\u201d Boyechko added.",
      "Ukraine now finds itself in a bind.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy cannot appear to be torpedoing what is a Trump initiative,\u201d Eyal said. After his catastrophic fallout with Trump in the White House in February, Zelenskyy has \u201cjust managed to repair his relationship with Trump over the last two months in a very gingerly fashion, and it would be the worst possible thing for him to appear now to be pooh-poohing this summit.\u201d",
      "Many Ukrainians were already skeptical. Before the summit was even announced, Artem Bidenko, a political scientist and former deputy minister in Ukraine\u2019s government, predicted that Putin \u201cwill most likely offer some kind of bone\u201d to Trump, who \u201cwill say that \u2018you see, I\u2019m doing well, I\u2019m already achieving peace, and people will stop dying,\u2019\u201d Bidenko said.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on these criticisms.",
      "Others in Kyiv have more faith in the American leader.",
      "\u201cTrump seems to be irritated enough by the Russians\u2019 actions to dare to strike really strong blows at Russia,\u201d said Danylo Vereitin, 31, a sports journalist based in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital. \u201cPeople with this type of mentality really don\u2019t like to look weak or vulnerable.\u201d",
      "During the presidential campaign last year, Trump said it would take him just 24 hours to solve the conflict, later updated that to six months and then seemingly forgot about it. Previous warm words about Putin have recently turned stern, and Trump appeared to be losing patience with Russia\u2019s \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful\u201d nightly missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians while the White House was attempting to broker peace talks.",
      "This culminated in Trump\u2019s deadline, first set at 50 days on July 14, then shortened to 10 days on July 29, for Putin to agree a ceasefire or face tariffs against importers of Russian oil and gas products like China, India, Brazil and Turkey.",
      "Asked whether this deadline was still active, Trump told reporters Thursday, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to him\u201d \u2014 meaning Putin \u2014 \u201cand we\u2019re going to see what he has to say,\u201d adding that he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d at the situation.",
      "A senior White House official told NBC News Friday that the Russians have provided a list of demands for a potential ceasefire, and the U.S. is now trying to get buy-in from the Ukrainians and European allies.",
      "But Trump's ultimatums have not prompted the Kremlin to move one inch on its war in Ukraine so far, other than to give Trump a meeting.",
      "\u201cNothing has changed since, frankly, December 2021, when Putin offered his ultimatum and said, \u2018Give me what I want or else Ukraine gets it,\u201d said James Nixey, a U.K.-based consultant specializing on Russia.",
      "\u201cTrump has done everything to pressure Russia, short of actually doing anything to pressure Russia,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s made all sorts of pronouncements, threats and Truth Social posts, but not actually undertaken any specific act which harms Russia.\u201d",
      "In 2021, Russia\u2019s eight-point draft treaty looks much the same as today : a ban on Ukraine ever joining NATO and a withdrawal of NATO forces on Russia\u2019s eastern flank. Today, Russia has merely added the additional demand of even more Ukrainian territory.",
      "Ukraine has rejected the idea of a ceasefire that would have Russia maintain  control over Ukrainian territory in its control, and insisted that any agreement must include \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d from its allies so that Moscow is not able to launch future aggression.",
      "\u201cPutin wants Ukraine, Ukraine wants to exist, Trump wants an end to the war and to be able to deal with Russia,\u201d Nixey said. \u201cAll of the major players have different agendas and none of them are aligned on anything.\u201d",
      "CORRECTION (Aug. 8, 2025, 05:12 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misattributed a comment about Putin\u2019s diplomatic isolation. The statement was made by Yuriy Boyechko, Hope for Ukraine\u2019s CEO, not Gabriella Ramirez."
