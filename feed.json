      "Carlos Diegues, one of Brazil\u2019s most renowned filmmakers, has died in Rio de Janeiro, aged 84, the Brazilian Academy of Letters said",
      "SAO PAULO -- Carlos Diegues, the renowned Brazilian filmmaker, died Friday in Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian Academy of Letters said. He was 84.",
      "The director of more than 20 films, including \u201cXica da Silva\u201d and \u201cBye Bye Brazil,\u201d Diegues was a leading figure in Cinema Novo, a movement that emerged in the 1960s and used film to critique social inequality, drawing inspiration from the French New Wave and Italian neorealism.",
      "The filmmaker, widely known as Cac\u00e1 Diegues, suffered complications after surgery, the academy said in a statement.",
      "President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said Diegues\u2019 films reflected Brazil \u2019s history, identity and creativity.",
      "\u201cI received with great sorrow the news of the passing of Cac\u00e1 Diegues, who throughout his life brought Brazil and Brazilian culture to the movie screens and captured the attention of the entire world,\u201d Lula said.",
      "\u201cBye Bye Brazil,\u201d a road movie about a country in transition, competed for the Palme d\u2019Or at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival. In 2010, Diegues produced \u201c5x Favela,\u201d a film entirely conceived, written and directed by young filmmakers from Rio de Janeiro\u2019s impoverished communities."

    "summary": "At 100 years old, the Goodyear Blimp is an ageless star in the sky",
    "story": [
      "At 100 years old, the Goodyear Blimp is an ageless star in the sky",
      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Flying a few hundred feet above the streets and shores of Daytona Beach, the Goodyear Blimp draws a crowd.",
      "Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie. For some, it\u2019s nostalgic. For others, it\u2019s a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon.",
      "At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday \u2014 roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually \u2014 to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour.",
      "Even though remote camera technologies \u2014 drones, mostly \u2014 are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2\u00bd-mile superspeedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to show the pack racing,\u201d Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday\u2019s race.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It\u2019s been at every Daytona 500 since 1962.",
      "During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn\u2019t much different from traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph \u2014 well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,\u201d blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it in the world.\u201d",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",
      "But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only even though phones at blimp headquarters \u2014 the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio \u2014 ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride.",
      "As part of the blimp\u2019s 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear\u2019s airship hangars.",
      "It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt.",
      "The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps.",
      "Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania.",
      "But will the blimp survive another 100 years?",
      "Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers.",
      "But given the blimp\u2019s longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come.",
      "\u201cDespite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,\" Kervern said. \u201cIt's just an iconic symbol for our nation.\u201d",

      "HarperCollins Publishers announced Thursday that the King-Sendak re-imagining of the famed Brothers Grimm tale about two lost children in a frightening forest is scheduled for Sept. 2. King's words will be complemented by sketches Sendak drew up for set and costume designs for a 1997 production of the Humperdinck opera adaptation.",
      "The book was initiated by the Maurice Sendak Foundation. King, author of \u201cThe Shining,\u201d \u201cCarrie\u201d and other horror classics, said he decided to agree to the project after seeing Sendak's illustrations.",
      "\u201cTwo of his pictures in particular spoke to me: One was of the wicked witch on her broom with a bag of kidnapped children riding behind her; the other was of the infamous candy house becoming a terrible face. I thought, \u2018This is what the house really looks like, a devil sick with sin, and it only shows that face when the kids turn their backs. I wanted to write that!\u2019\" King said in a statement issued through HarperCollins.",
      "\"To me, it was the essence of this story and, really, all fairy tales: a sunny exterior, a dark and terrible center, brave and resourceful children. In a way, I have been writing about kids like Hansel and Gretel for much of my life.\u201d",
      "Representatives for King say he has no memory of meeting Sendak, although King has expressed admiration for the musical \u201cReally Rosie,\u201d a Sendak-Carole King collaboration.",
      "Lynn Caponera, the Sendak foundation's executive director, said in a statement that she thought King ideal because outside of the Grimms, \u201che's the master of scary stories and a wonderful writer to boot.\u201d",
      "Sendak, who died in 2012, spoke about Hansel and Gretel around the time he was working on the opera. In an interview published in the 2003 book \u201cThe Art of Maurice Sendak\u201d he called the fairy tale \u201cthe most profound\u201d of the Grimm canon.",
      "\u201cGenerally speaking, most of Grimm is about heroic children. \u2018Hansel and Gretel\u2019 are the most heroic of them all,\u201d said Sendak, known for \u201cWhere the Wild Things Are,\u201d \u201cIn the Night Kitchen\u201d and other children's favorites. \"It\u2019s the toughest story in the world and people are afraid of it, yet it\u2019s famous because it\u2019s so truthful.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Golden State Warriors are known for their electrifying plays and superstar Stephen Curry, but now the team is pioneering a fresh gameplan: blending sports and entertainment in a way no NBA franchise has before.",
      "As the first and only NBA team with its own record label, Golden State Entertainment, the Warriors are expanding their reach with \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a new album released this week. The project featuring the Bay Area\u2019s top music artists \u2014 from E-40, Too Short, Saweetie, G-Eazy, Goapele, LaRussell and Larry June \u2014 arrives just in time for the league's All-Star Game weekend in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cA basketball team with a record label is unheard of until now, which is a testament to the Warriors and the Bay,\u201d said P-Lo, a Filipino-American rapper who produced \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a collaborative release between Golden State Entertainment and EMPIRE, a distribution and publishing company. He will perform live during an NBA All-Star tipoff party on Thursday at Thrive City, a 11-acre community gathering space surrounding the Chase Center.",
      "\u201cThis is about innovation, bringing a new idea to the table,\u201d said P-Lo, a lifelong Warriors fan who has worked with artists such as Yo Gotti, Saweetie and Kehlani. He's no stranger to the franchise, riding his convertible car as part of the Warriors championship parade, celebrating the team's title in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe're here to break barriers while I'm trying to process it all,\" he added. \"I'm grateful for this opportunity.\u201d",
      "Warriors guard Gary Payton II said he plans on listening to the album.",
      "\u201cFor me, to be the first team to have a music company, or production company, it\u2019s kinda cool,\u201d Payton said. \u201cP-Lo is running it, and getting it done. I know there\u2019s a lot of talented Bay Area artists behind it, so it\u2019s something to look forward to and be excited about.\u201d",
      "P-Lo played a key role in bringing together the Bay Area\u2019s top artists, contributing to all nine tracks on the album. He began the process late last summer, collaborating with local talent to craft a well-rounded project.",
      "\u201cP-Lo can produce, rap and bring all these artists who are like family to him,\u201d said David Kelly, an executive with the Warriors. He spearheaded the launch of Golden State Entertainment in 2022 before the team won the championship that year.",
      "Several NBA teams have partnered with artists over the years: Drake as the Toronto Raptors\u2019 global ambassador, Jay-Z as a former minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets, and the Miami Heat collaborating with DJ Khaled, who performed at games. The Atlanta Hawks have also embraced their city\u2019s rap scene, working with T.I., 2 Chainz, and Quavo.",
      "But an NBA team with its own record label and entertainment division? That\u2019s where Kelly saw an opportunity for the Warriors to break new ground. He said creating a label, intersecting hip-hop and basketball made sense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of authentic and natural to the culture,\u201d said Kelly, who joined the organization in 2011 and currently is the chief business officer of Golden State Entertainment. \u201cIt seems like a lot of times people try to force them apart or mesh them together that don\u2019t make sense. But if you grew up a part of both, they naturally intertwine.\u201d",
      "Kelly first pitched the idea of the Warriors having a record label to then-president Rick Welts before bringing it to the team\u2019s owner, Joe Lacob, and co-executive chairman Peter Guber. He said the Warriors' leadership embraced his vision, and he hopes more pro teams will follow suit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seeing the culture being presented in a way that\u2019s true and reflective on a grand international scale,\u201d said Kelly, a former Chicago-based rapper, whose stage name was Capital D. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many for Golden State and the culture.\u201d",

      "Lawyers will give their closing arguments at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There's one essential difference between arguments at rapper A$AP Rocky 's trial: Prosecutors will say Thursday that the hip-hop star fired two shots at a former friend from a handgun, while defense lawyers will say he fired blanks from a gun that wasn't real.",
      "Jurors should begin deliberations by the afternoon on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for the 2021 shooting. If they convict Rocky of both, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The Grammy-nominated music star, fashion mogul and actor is the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear in court for closing arguments after showing up sporadically \u2014 most recently last week, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Testimony at the trial ended Tuesday, when Rocky and his lawyers told a judge he would not take the stand.",
      "The prosecution's case rests largely on the credibility of the man Rocky is alleged to have fired on. A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, became friends with Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, in high school in New York, where both were members of a crew of creative types called the A$AP Mob.",
      "Their friendship continued after Rocky first gained global fame with a pair of No. 1 albums in 2012 and 2013, but by Nov. 6, 2021 their bond had become a beef.",
      "They met up outside a Hollywood hotel, and scuffled as soon as they saw each other. In a second confrontation moments later, Rocky fired the shots. Relli said his knuckles were grazed by one of them. The fights were partially captured on surveillance videos that are not clear enough for easy interpretation.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy, another member of the crew who was with Rocky, testified that Relli had been the aggressor, and that Rocky fired the shots as a warning to stop him from attacking another member of their crew.",
      "Twelvyy testified that Rocky fired blanks from a starter pistol that the rapper had been carrying for security since a music video shoot months earlier, and that everyone involved in the incident knew it. Rocky's tour manager also testified that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Neither gun was found or presented as evidence.",
      "Police who searched the area after a report of a shooting found no physical evidence, but Relli himself went to a police department two days later with two shell casings he said he'd picked up after returning to the scene.",
      "In closing arguments, the defense will contend that video evidence and text messages can't be trusted, nor can Relli. He also filed a civil suit in the case, and Rocky's attorneys will cast him as a jealous opportunist out for the money of a former friend who became famous. Relli vowed to do just that in text messages and in phone calls recorded by a mutual friend who gave the recordings to Rocky. Relli said in his testimony that the calls were faked.",
      "The prosecution will argue that Relli is justly seeking money after a genuine wrong was done to him. They point out that Relli's communications around the incident tell a consistent story \u2014 and never does he mention making anything up or knowing Rocky carried a prop gun. Prosecutors are likely to argue that the whole idea of the starter pistol \u2014 which only fires blanks \u2014 is a preposterous lie coordinated by Rocky's inner circle.",
      "In one of a series of arguments between lawyers that grew so nasty and personal during the trial that the judge began threatening fines, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin called the prop gun argument \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The inner-Vatican machinations of \u201cConclave\u201d have nothing on this year\u2019s Oscar race.",
      "Just as Edward Berger\u2019s film juggles various candidates for the papacy, the race for best picture at the Academy Awards has seen one favorite replaced by another, and then another.",
      "While some clarity has lately emerged, with a handful of big wins for Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora,\u201d it seems likely to be a nail biter until a winner is declared at the March 2 Oscars, when white smoke unfurls from the Sistine Chapel, I mean the Dolby Theatre.",
      "As of now, \u201cAnora\u201d is the clear frontrunner thanks to wins with the Producers Guild and the Directors Guild \u2014 both prizes with a long history of predicting Oscar winners. Where the Screen Actors Guild and the BAFTAs fall will offer the last major clues.",
      "But unlike years like last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was way ahead wire to wire, no lead in this year\u2019s best picture race seems ironclad. So, with that in mind, here are the best picture nominees, ranked in order of least likely to win to most likely to win. It\u2019s telling that at least half of these films, with three weeks to go, still have a chance.",
      "If this was a ranking of merit, RaMell Ross\u2019s movie would be first. Ross\u2019 film, thrillingly and thoughtfully shot largely in first person, introduced a new filmic grammar to American movies. But \u201cNickel Boys\u201d was seemingly on the cusp of getting a nomination, so we should just be glad it\u2019s counted here among the best of the year.",
      "Denis Villeneuve\u2019s first Frank Herbert adaptation garnered 10 nominations and won six. \u201cPart Two\u201d hasn\u2019t been the same awards force. It\u2019s up for five nominations and will probably walk home with one or two Oscars, possibly for visual effects and sound. People like \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d but sequels tend to have a harder go of it at the Academy Awards. Blame it on the sandworms.",
      "Arguably no film has risen up the Oscar ranks more than Walter Salles\u2019 portrait of political resistance under Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship. The film, a box-office sensation in its native country, was once one of the many international underdogs vying for a place at the Academy Awards. It won\u2019t win best picture, but it\u2019s a testament to the film\u2019s appeal that it could upset \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d in best international film.",
      "Coralie Fargeat\u2019s body-horror film has turned out to be much more of an Oscar contender than initially believed \u2014 certainly by Universal, which financed the film but sold it to Mubi to distribute. It\u2019s up for five awards but its best chance comes in the best actress category where Demi Moore is the favorite. Mikey Madison (\u201cAnora\u201d) and Fernanda Torres (\u201cI\u2019m Still Here\u201d) could make that a close call, too, but Moore \u2014 propelled by her \u201cpopcorn actress\u201d narrative and the movie's biting showbiz satire \u2014 is the frontrunner.",
      "How far can a former frontrunner fall? Jacques Audiard\u2019s narco-musical leads all films with 13 nominations but the Netflix movie has been in freefall since its star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, became ensnarled by a scandal over old tweets. I\u2019m not completely counting \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d out \u2013 you don\u2019t get 13 nominations for nothing. But \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d a divisive movie to begin with, is now in the business of salvaging its chances in other categories, like best supporting actress, where Zoe Salda\u00f1a could win.",
      "Now we\u2019re into the top contenders. Most likely, the winner is coming from one of these next five. Jon M. Chu\u2019s Broadway adaptation might have the most moviegoers rooting for it to win, but it\u2019s missing some key ingredients for pulling out best picture. Chu missed on a nomination for best director and the \u201cWicked\u201d has mostly been out-musical-ed by \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d on the awards circuit. Still, \u201cWicked\u201d has cornered the market on the role of Big Studio Movie contender. However it does, the film academy is going to make sure \u201cWicked\u201d is front and center during the ceremony.",
      "Here we have our Everyone Likes It contender. Berger\u2019s papal thriller, starring Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal tasked with leading a conclave, feels like the most universally respected nominee. In a year where votes are spread across a lot of films, that might be a quality that \u2014 particularly considering the academy\u2019s preferential ballot \u2014 leaves \u201cConclave\u201d driving the Oscar home in a popemobile. What\u2019s the main knock against this happening, aside from the potential difficulty of renting a popemobile? Berger was passed over on a directing nomination, and \u201cConclave\u201d hasn\u2019t yet won a major award. More than any other movie, it needs a victory at the BAFTAs.",
      "James Mangold\u2019s Bob Dylan movie is also widely liked and lacks any precursor win. But admiration for \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d is widespread and it could, just as \u201cConclave\u201d might, pull out an upset by rising high on a plethora of ballots. Unlike \u201cConclave,\u201d Mangold was nominated for best director, though, and it has the benefit of being led by Hollywood\u2019s biggest young star, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. Hollywood likes to, in picking a best picture winner, say something about its future. Chalamet's star power could be convincing enough. Plus Searchlight Pictures has previously steered quite a few best-picture winners (\"Nomadland,\" \u201cThe Shape of Water\u201d). Mangold\u2019s movie has momentum, which, even if it doesn\u2019t lead to best picture, may propel Chalamet to best actor over Adrien Brody for \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "Until recently, Brady Corbet\u2019s postwar epic might have been the top pick. \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d has been an award-winner at Venice and the Golden Globes. It\u2019s up for 10 Oscars. It\u2019s roundly been hailed as visionary, hugely ambitious cinema \u2014 all made, remarkably, with a budget under $10 million. It\u2019s also three and a half hours long. Not every Oscar voter, I assure you, is watching it all the way through. That, though, might not be a bad thing for a movie that falls off in the second half.",
      "Half a year ago, \u201cAnora\u201d was the odds-on pick to win best picture and now, after a topsy-turvy awards season, it is again. A trio of wins \u2014 at the PGA Awards, the DGA Awards and Critics Choice \u2014 has reestablished \u201cAnora\u201d as the movie to beat.",
      "If it wins at the SAG Awards, too, the race is probably over. Not everything with similar credentials has won before, though; \u201c1917\u201d had the same wins before being defeated by \u201cParasite\u201d five years ago. \u201cAnora,\u201d however, also won the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes, like \u201cParasite\u201d did, so it should do well among international voters \u2014 a crucial voting bloc in today's academy.",
      "It\u2019s also just really good. \u201cAnora\u201d comes from a widely respected filmmaker in Baker, a prominent defender of the theatrical release. And his movie, a sly and devastating twist on a \u201cPretty Woman\u201d-like fable, is as connected to Hollywood's celebrated '70s as it is to its indie filmmaking present.",

      "The lawsuit filed Wednesday in New York state court says the documentary, \u201c Diddy: Making of a Bad Boy,\u201d included statements that NBC Universal either knew were false or published with reckless disregard for the truth in order to defame the founder of Bad Boy Records.",
      "\u201cIndeed, the entire premise of the Documentary assumes that Mr. Combs has committed numerous heinous crimes, including serial murder, rape of minors, and sex trafficking of minors, and attempts to crudely psychologize him,\u201d the complaint reads. \u201cIt maliciously and baselessly jumps to the conclusion that Mr. Combs is a \u2018monster\u2019 and \u2018an embodiment of Lucifer\u2019 with \u2018a lot of similarities\u2019 to Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d",
      "Spokespersons for NBC Universal and the entertainment company that produced the documentary, which is also named in the suit, didn\u2019t immediately respond to emails seeking comment. The documentary premiered last month on Peacock TV, the network\u2019s streaming service.",

      "A federal appeals court has upheld singer R. Kelly's racketeering convictions and a 30-year prison sentence, finding he exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women",
      "NEW YORK -- R. Kelly\u2019s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March.",
      "The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling \u201cunprecedented,\" saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law \u201cto situations absurdly remote\u201d from the statute's intent.",
      "Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago.",
      "The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper.",
      "\u201cEnabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,\u201d the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls.",
      "\u201cEvidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,\u201d the three-judge panel said.",
      "The appeals court said it was \u201cneither arbitrary nor irrational\u201d that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify.",
      "\u201cNone of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, \u201cwere properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.\u201d",
      "Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's \u201cexcellent opinion,\u201d but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available.",
      "\u201cThis was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,\u201d Bonjean said.",
      "Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and the cult classic \u201cTrapped in the Closet,\u201d a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.",
      "Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex.",
      "Widespread outrage over Kelly\u2019s sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d",

      "It was probably less than that since McCartney\u2019s sound board and gear \u2014 too much to fit backstage \u2014 occupied a portion of the floor space at the venerable downtown theater. The whole thing felt like, and was, a lark. McCartney announced the show just hours before taking the stage.",
      "Like an echo of Beatlemania, the news swept through Manhattan and beyond earlier in the day, sending New Yorkers sprinting down Delancey Street for a chance to snag one of the few tickets at the Bowery. Most in attendance, including McCartney, himself, could hardly believe it was happening.",
      "\u201cSo, here we are,\u201d McCartney said, grinning. \u201cSome little gig. New York. Why not?\u201d",
      "Later, he added before launching into \u201cLet Me Roll It\u201d: \u201cI can\u2019t quite believe we\u2019re here, doing this. But we are here, doing this.\u201d",
      "It was not McCartney\u2019s first impromptu concert. The Beatles, of course, famously performed atop the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters at 3 Savile Row in London in 1969. Since then he\u2019s made something of a habit of it on trips to New York.",
      "In 2009, McCartney returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of the Beatles\u2019 famous U.S. debut, and performed above the marquee. In 2018, he popped up in Grand Central Terminal to promote the release of his \u201cEgyptian Station.\u201d",
      "With temperatures in the low 30s on Tuesday, McCartney, 82, this time opted for an intimate, indoor show. Tickets were sold only physically at the venue, one per person. All were snapped up within about 30 minutes.",
      "For those quick enough, it was like hitting the lottery.",
      "Amy Jaffe, 69, was at home about 30 blocks north when she saw the announcement on Instagram. \u201cI thought: I can do this,\u201d Jaffe said before the show. \u201cI put on jeans, grabbed a coat, called a Lyft.\u201d",
      "Jaffe has seen McCartney many times before, including with the Beatles in 1964 in Forrest Hills, Queens. But she was still incredulous, smiling and shaking her head: \u201cI don\u2019t actually believe it.\u201d",
      "Phil Sokoloff, 31, was on his way to work nearby when he saw the news. He ran in and told his co-worker, Mat Fuller, and they rushed over to the Bowery Ballroom.",

      "If the location was stripped down, the former Beatle didn\u2019t come with a minimized show, packing in a blistering tour through his entire catalog, from Beatles classics to Wings hits. He began with \u201cA Hard Day\u2019s Night\u201d and also performed \u201cGot To Get You Into My Life,\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019m Amazed,\u201d \u201cLady Madonna,\u201d \u201cJet,\u201d \u201cGet Back,\u201d \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\u201d \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cHey Jude.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlackbird\u201d was a solo number on acoustic guitar, and afterward McCartney reflected on how he wrote it for the Civil Rights Movement, a memory that brought back his first trips to the United States.",
      "\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d McCartney said. \u201cI\u2019ve got grandchildren older than that now.\u201d",
      "In the early days, he said, he and John Lennon were always writing for the audience, and the songs were all about reaching out: \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d \u201cFrom Me to You.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt had everything to do with the fans, really,\u201d McCartney said.",
      "Before playing the Wings song \u201cMrs. Vanderbilt,\u201d McCartney spoke of playing it in front of 350,000 people in Kyiv, when Ukraine was exuberant with a newfound freedom. \u201cLet\u2019s hope it gets back to that soon,\u201d he said.",
      "Conversation, mixed with shouts from the audience, peppered the set. After one particularly shrill scream, McCartney responded. \u201cThat was a Beatles scream.\u201d Then he asked for more, saying, \u201cOK, let\u2019s get it out of the way. Girls, give me a Beatles scream.\u201d All in attendance obliged.",
      "McCartney also performed the so-called last Beatles song, \u201c Now and Then,\u201d a ballad penned by Lennon in the late \u201970s but only released in 2023 with the help of the some of the technology used in Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary, \u201c The Beatles: Get Back.\u201d The song made McCartney wistful for his songwriting partner, whom he noted loved New York.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s hear it for John,\u201d he said.",
      "McCartney, who was spotted Sunday at the Super Bowl in New Orleans chatting with Adam Sandler, was in New York for the upcoming \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d 50th anniversary festivities. He\u2019s to be a guest on the star-studded television special Sunday.",
      "It was unclear if McCartney was playing a single show or preparing for something more. He wrapped the Got Back Tour in December and has said he\u2019s hoping to finish a new album this year.",
      "For now, though, it was a one-night-only event. One crowd member asked McCartney if it could go all night. \u201cSome of us need to get some sleep, you know,\u201d he replied.",
      "McCartney still came back, bouncing on the stage for an encore. He closed with the rousing \u201cAbbey Road\u201d send off of \u201cCarry That Weight\u201d and \u201cThe End,\u201d concluded with its immortalized final lines: \u201cAnd in the end/ The love you take/ Is equal to the love you make.\u201d",

      "The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from attending an event in the Oval Office after demanding the news agency alter its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump has ordered renamed to the Gulf of America",
      "NEW YORK -- The White House blocked an Associated Press reporter from an event in the Oval Office on Tuesday after demanding the news agency alter its style on the Gulf of Mexico, which President Donald Trump has ordered renamed the Gulf of America.",
      "The reporter, whom the AP would not identify, tried to enter the White House event as usual Tuesday afternoon and was turned away. Later, a second AP reporter was barred from a late-evening event in the White House's Diplomatic Reception Room.",
      "The highly unusual ban, which Trump administration officials had threatened earlier Tuesday unless the AP changed the style on the Gulf, could have constitutional free-speech implications.",
      "Julie Pace, AP's senior vice president and executive editor, called the administration's move unacceptable.",
      "\u201cIt is alarming that the Trump administration would punish AP for its independent journalism,\u201d Pace said in a statement. \u201cLimiting our access to the Oval Office based on the content of AP\u2019s speech not only severely impedes the public\u2019s access to independent news, it plainly violates the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration made no immediate announcements about the moves, and there was no indication any other journalists were affected. Trump has long had an adversarial relationship with the media. On Friday, the administration ejected a second group of news organizations from Pentagon office space.",
      "Before his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump announced plans to change the Gulf of Mexico\u2019s name to the \u201cGulf of America\u201d \u2014 and signed an executive order to do so as soon as he was in office. Mexico\u2019s president responded sarcastically and others noted that the name change would probably not affect global usage.",
      "Besides the United States, the body of water \u2014 named the Gulf of Mexico for more than 400 years \u2014 also borders Mexico.",
      "The AP said last month, three days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, that it would continue to refer to the Gulf of Mexico while noting Trump\u2019s decision to rename it as well. As a global news agency that disseminates news around the world, the AP says it must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.",
      "AP style is not only used by the agency. The AP Stylebook is relied on by thousands of journalists and other writers globally.",
      "Barring the AP reporter was an affront to the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which bars the government from impeding the freedom of the press, said Tim Richardson, program director of journalism and misinformation for PEN America.",
      "The White House Correspondents Association called the White House move unacceptable and called on the administration to change course.",
      "\u201cThe White House cannot dictate how news organizations report the news, nor should it penalize working journalists because it is unhappy with their editors' decision,\u201d said Eugene Daniels, WHCA's president.",
      "This week, Google Maps began using \u201cGulf of America,\" saying it had a \u201clongstanding practice\u201d of following the U.S. government\u2019s lead on such matters. The other leading online map provider, Apple Maps, was still using \u201cGulf of Mexico\" earlier Tuesday but by early evening had changed to \u201cGulf of America\" on some browsers, though at least one search produced results for both.",
      "Trump also decreed that the mountain in Alaska known as Mount McKinley and then by its Indigenous name, Denali, be shifted back to commemorating the 25th president. President Barack Obama had ordered it renamed Denali in 2015. AP said last month it will use the official name change to Mount McKinley because the area lies solely in the United States and Trump has the authority to change federal geographical names within the country.",

      "Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece.",
      "Bowers\u2019 work on \u201c The Wild Robot \u201d continues to solidify his place as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after composers, earning him a nomination for best original score. His score complements the film\u2019s stunning visuals and emotional depth, capturing the journey of Roz, an out-of-place robot striving to connect with animals who struggle to understand it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being really clear with each story, understanding what the emotions is and what\u2019s stirring inside of me,\u201d said Bowers, 35, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated composer who won an Academy Award for the short documentary \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d He\u2019s also worked on Oscar-winning films such as \u201cKing Richard\u201d and \u201c Green Book.\u201d",
      "For \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bowers first studied the early black-and-white sketches, where he uncovered his emotions toward the characters, before capturing those feelings at his piano, crafting a musical narrative filled with heart. Bowers said tapping into his emotions has never come easily, but he found inspiration in his journey as a father, watching his wife sacrifice her body during pregnancy, to help craft sounds that capture the essence of parenthood.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bowers reflects on what the Oscar nomination means to him, the challenges of composing for animated films, the lasting influence of five-time Oscar winner John Williams and why Kobe Bryant \u2019s advice continues to resonate with him.",
      "The Oscars will air March 2.",
      "____",
      "BOWERS: It means a lot. As a kid, that's how I found a lot of composers. I was looking at that (Oscar noms) list. I would look at who's nominated then go listen to those scores, so it became a way to expand my collection of CDs. It means something to be a part of this history. No matter what happens in my career from here on out, somebody's going to look at this year's list and see my name. To be nominated, you are chosen by the music branch of the academy ... filled with composers who I've been a fan of since I was a kid. ... It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful.",
      "BOWERS: Yeah, he was the master of memorable melody. If there's a piece of score in a move that you can sing, it's probably John Williams. One thing I took from him is that he came up in a time of composers who were storytellers and made sure the music was also developing the story. When those themes come back at the most pivotal point in the movie, we feel something emotional. I remember for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I studied the last 30 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\u201d primarily because the last 20-30 minutes of \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is all action. I thought, \u201cHow did John Williams approach this?\" Because \u201cStar Wars\u201d was so iconic with its themes.",
      "BOWERS: The only moment was when I played the main theme. I was kind of just wanting to see if it triggered that complexity. I do this often with my wife where I\u2019ll have a theme that I\u2019m playing it and ask her \u201cWhat does this remind of, or what does this make you feel? I remember when I played her that sequence, which was a work in progress, and she got emotional. She cried watching just that three-minute sequence, having no idea of what the movie was about. I felt like I was on the right track. ... It\u2019s reminding her of all the complex emotions she feels as a mom. I struck a nerve in a way that could be valuable.",
      "BOWERS: It\u2019s definitely more challenging. If you talk to any composer, they\u2019ll talk about the fact that animation is its own challenge. Most animated films have almost wall-to-wall music where music kind of doesn\u2019t ever stop. Whereas, a lot of live action, you can sit for five minutes and not have any music and be OK.",
      "BOWERS: I did a lot of work for Kobe. He talked about John Williams being my Michael Jordan. He was all about obsessing enough about your craft, so that you are ready for anything. The stuff I wrote for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I learned from when he would challenge me to write. I wrote this audiobook for him, and he was like \u201cYou know this has to be better than the music for \u2018E.T.\u2019?",
      "I laughed. And he was like \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not (expletive) kidding with you, right?\u201d",
      "He was always telling me, \u201cIf you\u2019re not taking on something that\u2019s going to make you a better artist by the time you finish it, then you are wasting your time.\u201d",
      "That kind of mentality is the way I approach everything. I want to take on as many things as possible. If that opportunity came, I\u2019d be prepared for it.",
      "BOWERS: I feel like my parents put me on this track from the very beginning. They wanted me to play piano before I was born. They gave me lessons and like found teachers for me. There\u2019s kind of like this debt I owe to them. I have to be as great as I possibly can. But it\u2019s also just me trying to live up to the steps my parents already got started for me.",

      "For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday",
      "NEW YORK -- For the first time in recent history, the percentage of top-grossing films featuring female protagonists equaled the percentage of films with male protagonists, according to a pair of annual studies released Tuesday.",
      "Movies like \u201cWicked,\"\u201cInside Out 2\" and \u201cThe Substance\u201d lifted Hollywood's theatrical releases to gender parity in leading roles in 2024. Of the 100 top domestic grossing films in 2024, 42% had female protagonists, and 42% had male protagonists, according to a report issued by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University.",
      "The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which also released its annual study Tuesday, found that 54% of the top 100 films at the box office in 2024 featured girls and women as protagonists. That's a massive jump from just the year prior, when 30% of films featured women in lead roles. In 2007, when the USC annual study began, that figure was just 20%.",
      "\"This is the first time we can say that gender equality has been reached in top-grossing films,\u201d Stacy L. Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2024, three of the top five films had a girl or woman in a leading role, as did five of the top 10 films \u2014 including the number one film of the year, Disney\u2019s \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019\" added Smith. \"We have always known that female-identified leads would make money. This is not the result of an economic awakening but is due to a number of different constituencies and efforts \u2014 at advocacy groups, at studios, through DEI initiatives \u2014 to assert the need for equality on screen.\u201d",
      "Other metrics suggested the gains in leading roles masked still-endemic disparity throughout Hollywood. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles increased from 35% to 37% in 2024, according to the San Diego State study. Major female characters rose from 38% in 2023 to 39% in 2024.",
      "\u201cFilms such as \u2018The Substance\u2019 pushed back hard against a culture that considers women disposable,\u201d Lauzen stated. \u201cWhile the number of films with female protagonists rose to a historic high in 2024 after a dismally lean 2023, the percentages of women in the more stable categories of major and speaking roles reflected only minor gains.\u201d",
      "Universal Studios, which is led by Donna Langley, was the studio with the best record for female representation. In 2024, 66.7% of Universal releases centered on girls and women, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.",
      "Neither study captures the large number of films released directly on streaming platforms or films that fall outside the top 100 movies in theaters. But for decades, those top box-office films have offered a snapshot of a film industry that has long failed to come close to reflecting the demographics of American society.",
      "That remains the case for underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, who account for roughly 42% of the U.S. population.",
      "In the top 2024 films in 2024, 25% included an underrepresented lead or co-lead, according to Annenberg. In those 25 movies, the lead or co-leads were 38.% Black, 15.4% Asian or Asian American and 3.9% Hispanic.",
      "That was a substantial decrease from 2023, when 37 leads or co-leads were people of color.",
      "\u201cThe progress we saw for female-identified leads was not matched by the findings for underrepresented leads,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis downturn signifies a lack of investment in storytelling that reflects the audience as a whole. The reality is that audiences want to see stories about women and people of color \u2014 studios and filmmakers do not have to choose between the two.\u201d"

      "In discussion with a Los Angeles judge on the last phases of Rocky's trial, his lawyer Joe Tacopina said that either his client would testify early Tuesday or the defense would rest its case. An attorney for the prosecution said his team was going to spend the night preparing for Rocky's testimony.",
      "He is not legally required to testify, and subjecting a defendant to a difficult cross-examination is often a major gamble in criminal cases.",

      "If Rocky testifies, he\u2019ll probably have to face a long and combative cross-examination from Deputy District Attorney John Lewin. In his most famous case, Lewin kept real estate heir Robert Durst on the stand for nine days of relentless questioning before he was convicted of murder.",

      "Levin said he got the gun from a video shoot in the summer of 2021, about three months before the incident that led to the charges, and on the day itself.",
      "He told the jury that he returned the phony gun to the music video's co-director, who no longer had it when Levin asked about it after Rocky's arrest. The defense said it does not have the starter pistol now.",
      "Authorities also did not recover the pistol they allege Rocky used.",
      "Levin testified that an ammunition magazine found in Rocky's house by officers serving a search warrant actually belonged to him.",
      "Lewin, the prosecutor, said \u201cyou had to come up with a story\u201d to explain the magazine. He later called every aspect of the story \u201ca lie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have to come up with a story \u2014 it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Levin said."

Israel responded with a devastating ground and air campaign striking across Gaza, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated.",
      "A ceasefire in the war began Jan. 19 and is still holding. Palestinian militants have freed hostages while Israel has released Palestinians held in prisons there. However, worries remains over whether the peace will hold. Comments by President Donald Trump, who was on hand Sunday night for the Super Bowl, suggesting the U.S. was \u201ccommitted to buying and owning Gaza,\u201d also have upended discussions about the enclave's future.",
      "The Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a future state of their own, with east Jerusalem as its capital. That long-sought, two-state solution for the decadeslong conflict is backed by Mideast nations and much of the international community. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza\u2019s population, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday calling it \u201da revolutionary, creative vision.\" Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it.",
      "Sudan, a nation in East Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "In recent weeks, Burhan's forces including Sudan's military and allied militias have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They've also pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. That fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. From Jan. 31 until Feb. 5, the U.N.s' Human Rights Office documented at least 275 civilian deaths from artillery, airstrikes and drone assaults.",
      "\u201cIndiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians must cease immediately,\u201d said Seif Magango, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Office. \u201cThe Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 and their allied movements and militias \u2014 must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders.\u201d",
      "Online, activists have sought to draw attention to both the Gaza Strip and Sudan, though the conflicts have different roots and participants. However, the idea of the two conflicts being linked by their devastation has been made by celebrities.",
      "In August, American rapper Macklemore said he canceled a concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates\u2019 role \u201cin the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis\u201d in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that\u2019s been fighting government troops there. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the RSF, U.N. experts reported \u201ccredible\u201d evidence last year showed that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.",
      "Macklemore at the time said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war. He has been performing a song called \u201cHind\u2019s Hall,\u201d in honor of a young girl named Hind Rajab killed in Gaza in a shooting Palestinians have blamed on Israeli forces opening fire on a civilian car."

      "Jon Batiste turned his Super Bowl opportunity into a symphony of artistry, the debut of new music and a tribute to his hometown roots",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- NEW ORLEANS (AP) \u2014 Jon Batiste transformed the Super Bowl stage into a symphony of creativity, debuting new music, reimagining \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\" and shining a global spotlight on his wife's creative vision.",
      "As Batiste performed the national anthem Sunday, the multi-talented musician played a piano adorned with a colorful butterfly painting by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who came up with the idea while making their documentary \u201cAmerican Symphony.\u201d Her artwork, the city\u2019s resilience after the New Year\u2019s attack, and the memory of his late veteran grandfather all fueled his performance.",
      "\u201cThis was powerful. The spirit came over me,\u201d Batiste told The Associated Press after his performance at the Caesars Superdome. On Monday he unveiled \u201cMy United State,\u201d a two-track project featuring \u201cStar-Spangled Blues\u201d and \u201cNotes from My Future Self.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in the history of the anthem that had samples included in it,\u201d said Batiste, a Louisiana native who is a Grammy and Oscar winner and former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d \u201cWe almost couldn\u2019t clear the main sample that I wanted until the night before.\u201d",
      "Batiste, 38, said his reinvented national anthem draws from \u201cDrag Rap\u201d by The Showboys \u2014 better known as the Triggerman beat \u2014 a staple of New Orleans bounce and hip-hop culture. He aimed to showcase the city's rich culture and heritage while putting his own stamp on a song that was first echoed at the Super Bowl in 1967, performed by The Pride of Arizona, the Michigan Marching Band and the UCLA Choir.",
      "Over the years, the anthem has been reimagined by music legends like Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Billy Joel, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all come in different tempos and melodies. It\u2019s a whole lot of things that wouldn\u2019t never work together unless it was framed by the American ideal. I wanted to capture it in an arrangement. Just in the sound.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Batiste reflected on his wife\u2019s resilience, new songs, an upcoming tour and his festival this weekend that will leave a lasting musical impact on New Orleans.",
      "During the filming of \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d inspiration struck \u2014 not just in the documentary, but on canvas. As Jaouad painted, one creation that took flight was a vivid butterfly, embodying what he calls the \u201cpower of resilience, delicate beauty, and grace.\u201d",
      "Jaouad's painting was on the piano and bench Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's the balance of this duality,\u201d he said about watching his wife creatively express herself during \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d which won a Grammy for best music film. \u201cIt Never Went Away\u201d from the documentary also won best song written for visual media. He's thankful for the collaboration and proud of Jaouad, a writer who is battling cancer for a third time.",
      "In December, she revealed her diagnosis on social media.",
      "\u201cShe's a one of a kind human being, like a person who has so much light from within,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cYou look into her eyes and you see the work. I'm very glad that she was able to not only survive, but have this alchemizing process of it all to lift it into something that's even more than just a way of making lemonade out of lemons.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis is more than just taking a bad thing and making it good. It's almost a blessing, as wild as it is to think about it like that.\u201d",
      "While crafting \u201cNotes from My Future Self,\u201d Batiste had three things on his mind: returning home, the national anthem and the wide-eyed wonder of him at 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt really brought together so many things in my subconscious,\u201d said the seven-time Grammy winner. \"It brought them together, like all these stories, notes. What would the young me think about what\u2019s happening now and how to really connect to this moment from their inner child plays in this song? It just came out of that.\u201d",
      "Batiste called the upbeat song an anthem that represents self-empowerment for himself and others too. He said making the song was a profound journey of artistic realization.",
      "\u201cWhen you hear the song and you\u2019re listening, it\u2019s me talking to my younger me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could also be you, talking to young you. In a moment like this, it\u2019s important for us to heal, to really thrive and be rooted in who we are. We have to go back to that kid.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the musical foundation came while talking to director Alan Ferguson, his frequent collaborator. He said they had a vision of using spoken word, poetry and hip-hop within the context of \u201cradical cause, positivity and openness.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of life,\u201d he said. \u201dIt's a natural intuition and the visual possibility and the evolution of me as an artist is just me going into this new zone. ... When it aligns like that, that's how I know it's the right direction.\"",
      "After Batiste's Super Bowl performance, his next goal is creating visuals for \u201cNotes from My Future Self\" and hitting the road for a concert tour.",
      "Full details have to yet been released, but he's looking to perform new music and songs from Beethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1),\u201d which reimagined the iconic German pianist\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cYou really get a twofer on this next run,\u201d Batiste said.",
      "Before delivering the national anthem, Jon Batiste brought his signature energy to New Orleans\u2019 9th Ward, turning a neighborhood into a stage for joy and community.",
      "His He Gets Us Presents Jon Batiste\u2019s Love Riot Festival transformed the grounds of George Washington Carver High School into a celebration of music, hope, and action. The event also highlighted plans for a future sports field to serve local schools.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make something where we go to the places that are forgotten but are the foundation,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cThey are the foundation of why we want to come to New Orleans in the first place and go to those communities.\u201d",
      "Batiste, alongside Sing for Hope, led 10 New Orleans artists in creating hand-painted pianos, scattered throughout the 9th Ward as an open invitation to the festival. After the event, these vibrant instruments will find permanent homes in schools and community centers, keeping the music alive long after the final note.",
      "\u201cThey greatest thing we can do is serve and not take it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a holistic view. ... Yes, I\u2019m honored to sing at the Super Bowl. I also want to leave something that impacts the community, my hometown.\u201d",

      "\u201cSalutations",
      "\u201cSalutations!,\u201d the actor Samuel L. Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam introduced Kendrick Lamar at New Orleans\u2019 Caesars Superdome for the 2025 Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 a powerful, commanding creative choice by the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot.",
      "As if there were any doubts of the Pulitzer Prize winning rapper's ability to put on a show.",
      "As dozens of dancers emerged from a Buick GNX clown car style, he launched into an as-yet-untitled new song that had been teased with an online snippet when his \"GNX\" album was released, then moved into \u201cSquabble Up.\" For just under 13 minutes during the halftime show sponsored by Apple Music and Roc Nation, Lamar commanded the field.",
      "Dancers dressed in red, white and blue joined Lamar. But even in their patriotic colors, they were labeled \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d by Jackson's Uncle Sam, who reminded Lamar to \u201cplay the game.\u201d Then, he launched into \u201cHumble.,\u201d \u201cDNA.,\" \u201cEuphoria\" and \u201cman at the garden.\u201d",
      "\u201cScore keeper, deduct one life,\u201d Jackson interrupted again. Lamar launched into \u201cpeakboo,\u201d and then teased a performance of \u201cNot Like Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanna play their favorite song but you know they love to sue,\u201d Lamar told the women dancers behind him, referencing Drake.",
      "It is hard to underscore the ubiquity of \u201cNot Like Us\u201d \u2014 with its billion streams on Spotify, the massive hit is a regional anthem for Los Angeles, a rallying cry for community and against culture vultures, a diss track that won Lamar the highly-publicized feud with Drake and the track that won song and record of the year at the Grammys last weekend.",
      "Leading up to the Super Bowl, whether or not Lamar would perform the song was a legitimate question held by fans and critics alike. Lamar levels strong accusations against Drake in its lyrics; Drake has sued Universal Music Group for defamation as a result of the song's popularity. Does a Super Bowl performance further complicate things?",
      "Little was known about Lamar's halftime performance ahead of time. Lamar promised to keep his passion for storytelling at the forefront of his plans, and SZA was a previously announced guest performer. They are frequent collaborators; she most recently appeared his recent album \u201cGNX\u201d and was featured on a couple songs including \u201cGloria\u201d and \u201cLuther,\u201d which also features sampled vocals from Luther Vandross and Cheryl Lynn through \u201cIf This World Were Mine.\u201d The duo will also co-headline a 19-city North American tour this spring and summer.",
      "SZA appeared on stage for \u201cLuther\" and \u201cAll the Stars.\"",
      "\u201cThat's what America wants \u2014 nice and calm,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "And then, like clockwork: Lamar launched into \"Not Like Us\" \u2014 with the removal of the word \u201cpedophiles\u201d in its lyrics \u2014 into \u201ctv off.\u201d",
      "He brought out the producer Mustard and tennis superstar Serena Williams was spotted crip walking along to the diss track.",
      "Is there any better publicity than the biggest stage in U.S. sports? Consider this just another step in Lamar's continued victory lap.",
      "He is also no stranger to the Super Bowl stage, having previously performed at the NFL\u2019s championship game in 2022 as a guest artist, alongside Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent and Eminem.",
      "\u201cRap music is still the most impactful genre to date,\u201d Lamar said in a statement in September, when he was first announced as the 2025 halftime performer. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there to remind the world why. They got the right one.\u201d",
      "Make no mistake about it \u2014 that's exactly what he did Sunday evening.",

      "Tom Robbins, the literary prankster-philosopher who charmed, enlightened and addled millions of readers with such adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Robbins, the novelist and prankster-philosopher who charmed and addled millions of readers with such screwball adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died. He was 92.",
      "Robbins\u2019 death was confirmed by his friend, the publishing executive Craig Popelars, who said the author died Sunday morning.",
      "Pronouncing himself blessed with \"crazy wisdom,\" Robbins published eight novels and the memoir \"Tibetan Peach Pie\" and looked fondly upon his world of deadpan absurdity, authorial commentary and zig zag story lines. No one had a wilder imagination, whether giving us a wayward heroine with elongated thumbs in \"Cowgirls\" or landing the corpse of Jesus in a makeshift zoo in \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" And no one told odder jokes on himself: Robbins once described his light, scratchy drawl as sounding \"as if it's been strained through Davy Crockett's underwear.\"",
      "He could fathom almost anything except growing up. People magazine would label Robbins \"the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters,\" who \"dips history's pigtails in weird ink and splatters his graffiti over the face of modern fiction.\"",
      "A native of Blowing Rock, North Carolina who moved to Virginia and was named \"Most Mischievous Boy\" by his high school, Robbins could match any narrative in his books with one about his life. There was the time he had to see a proctologist and showed up wearing a duck mask. (The doctor and Robbins became friends). He liked to recall the food server in Texas who unbuttoned her top and revealed a faded autograph, his autograph.",
      "Or that odd moment in the 1990s when the FBI sought clues to the Unabomber's identity by reading Robbins' novel \"Still Life with Woodpecker.\" Robbins would allege that two federal agents, both attractive women, were sent to interview him.",
      "\"The FBI is not stupid!\" he liked to say. \"They knew my weakness!\"",
      "He also managed to meet a few celebrities, thanks in part to the film adaptation of \"Even Cowgirls,\" which starred Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves, and to appearances in such movies as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.\" He wrote of being Debra Winger's date to the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony and nearly killing himself at an Oscars after-party when \u2014 hoping to impress Al Pacino \u2014 he swallowed a glass of cologne. He had happier memories of checking into a hotel and being recognized by a young, pretty clerk, who raved about his work and ignored the man standing next to him, Neil Young.",
      "In Robbins\u2019 novels, the quest was all and he helped capture the wide open spirit of the 1960s in part because he knew the life so well. He dropped acid, hitchhiked coast to coast, traveled from Tanzania to the Himalayas and carried on with friends and strangers in ways he had no right to survive. He didn't rely on topical references to mark time, but on understanding the era from the inside.",
      "\"Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,\" he wrote in his memoir, published in 2014. \"I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.\"",
      "His path to fiction writing had its own rambling, hallucinatory quality. He was a dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate) who joined the Air Force because he didn't know what else to do. He moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early '60s and somehow was assigned to review an opera for the Seattle Times, becoming the first classical music critic to liken Rossini to Robert Mitchum. Robbins would soon find himself in a farcical meeting with conductor Milton Katims, making conversation by pretending he was working on his own libretto, \"The Gypsy of Issaquah,\" named for a Seattle suburb.",
      "\"You must admit it had an operatic ring,\" Robbins insisted.",
      "By the late 1960s, publishers were hearing about his antics and thought he might have a book in him. A Doubleday editor met with Robbins and agreed to pay $2,500 for what became \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" Published in 1971, Robbins' debut novel sold little in hardcover despite praise from Graham Greene and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, but became a hit in paperback. \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" came out in 1976 and eventually sold more than 1 million copies.",
      "\"Read solemnly, with expectations of conventional coherence, \u2018Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\u2019 will disappoint,\" Thomas LeClair wrote in The New York Times. \"Entered like a garage sale, poked through and picked over, \u2018Cowgirls\u2019 is entertaining and, like the rippled mirror over there by the lawn mower, often instructive. Tom Robbins is one of our best practitioners of high foolishness.\u201d",
      "Domestic stability was another prolonged adventure; one ex-girlfriend complained \u201cThe trouble with you, Tom, is that you have too much fun.\u201d He was married and divorced twice, and had three children, before settling down with his third wife, Alexa d'Avalon, who appeared in the film version of \u201cEven Cowgirls Get the Blues.\u201d",
      "Robbins' other books included \"Half Asleep in Frogs Pajamas,\" \"Fierce Invalids Home from Home Climates,\" \u201cVilla Incognito.\u201d His honors included the Bumbershoot Golden Umbrella Award for Lifetime Achievement and being named by Writer's Digest as among the 100 best authors of the 20th century. But he cherished no praise more than a letter received from an unnamed woman.",
      "\"Your books make me laugh, they make think, they make me horny,\" his fan informed him, \u201cand they make me aware of all the wonder in the world.\u201d"

      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a busy soccer calendar",
      "LONDON -- Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season's Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",
      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It's inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that's planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",
      "Given the number of injuries sustained by Arsenal players this season \u2014 others to have had long spells out include Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2014 some have questioned whether Arteta\u2019s training methods are to blame.",
      "Maybe that was the reason why Arteta was eager to point out that Arsenal\u2019s players now \u201ctrain less than ever\u201d and go into a deeper explanation about how too many games \u2014 and, as a result, not enough training \u2014 affects players\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cThe muscle is undertrained and then you expose the muscle and the tendon to an exposure that they cannot absorb because the tendon needs 72 hours to recover,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cA lot of people talk about what we're doing outside. It\u2019s not outside, it\u2019s inside.",
      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d",

      "The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on the confirmation of Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent lawyer and vocal vaccine critic, as the nation's health secretary, controlling $1.7 trillion in spending for vaccines, food safety and health insurance programs for roughly half the country.",
      "Despite several Republicans expressing deep skepticism about his views on vaccines, Kennedy is expected to win confirmation, absent any last-minute changes.",
      "Kennedy, 71, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has earned a formidable following with his populist \u2014 and sometimes extreme \u2014 views on food, chemicals and vaccines.",
      "His audience only grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kennedy devoted much of his time to a nonprofit that sued vaccine makers and harnessed social media campaigns to erode trust in vaccines as well as the government agencies that promote them.",
      "With the backing of Republican President Donald Trump, Kennedy believes he is \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to revive trust in those public health agencies, which include the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes for Health.",
      "Republican senators have largely embraced Kennedy's vision, reciting his newly hatched slogan to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d in speeches.",
      "Last week, North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis said he hopes Kennedy \u201cgoes wild\u201d on reigning in health care costs and improving Americans' health. But one holdout \u2014 GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana doctor \u2014 required assurances that Kennedy would not make changes to existing vaccine recommendations before agreeing to back him.",
      "Democrats have remained skeptical, unsuccessfully prodding Kennedy during hearings to deny a long discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. And some have raised alarms about Kennedy financially benefiting from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers.",
      "Kennedy made more than $850,000 last year from an arrangement referring clients to a law firm that has sued the makers of Gardasil, a human papillomavirus vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. While serving as health secretary, he has promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son.",
      "Kennedy is expected to take over the agency in the midst of a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off \u2014 even if temporarily \u2014 billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs.",
      "On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars in medical research given to universities and cancer being used to develop treatments for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.",
      "Kennedy, too, has called for a staffing overhaul at the NIH, FDA and CDC. Last year, he vowed to fire 600 employees at the NIH, the nation's largest funder of biomedical research."

      "The Trump administration's abrupt freeze in foreign aid has closed health clinics offering free care in one of Syria's most vulnerable regions",
      "SARMADA, Syria -- In the town of Sarmada in northern Syria, Dr. Mohammad Fares unlocked a clinic that once bustled with patients. Now it's empty, and shelves of medicine reduced to a few boxes of bandages and expired drugs.",
      "This is what it looks like after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, issued stop-work orders during a 90-day review for what the administration has alleged is wasteful spending.",
      "Fares had been working in three clinics run by M\u00e9decins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, offering free health care to the displaced population in northern Syria, which until the fall of former President Bashar Assad in December had been the country's main rebel-held enclave. It sheltered millions of people who had fled years of civil war.",
      "Their already grim camps swelled again in 2023 after a deadly magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit Turkey and northern Syria. Since the fall of Assad, some displaced Syrians have begun to return home, but many have no homes left.",
      "Fares\u2019 clinic in Sarmada used to support 16 camps in the region, assisting approximately 35,000 people. Since the aid freeze, 10 such clinics receiving USAID funding had to close, and Doctors of the World had to lay off 184 people, officials with the organization said.",
      "\u201cIf the support is not resumed, there will be a major disaster and serious harm to vulnerable groups,\u201d said Fares, who heads the organization\u2019s medical programs. \u201cOperating costs of clinics are much lower than those of hospitals. The cessation of work in these clinics will put increased pressure on emergency hospitals and other healthcare facilities\"",
      "This part of Syria lacks centralized government healthcare, leaving people reliant on nonprofit providers and making the impact of the sudden U.S. cuts especially dire, aid workers and experts said.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that withdrawing all of USAID\u2019s support in Syria would be equivalent to a devastating shock of 5% to its already struggling economy. This is among the largest impacts on any recipient.\" said Ian Mitchell, senior policy fellow at the Washington based Center for Global Development.",
      "The U.S. had been providing 25 cents in foreign aid for every $100 of U.S. income, Mitchell said, but that relatively small contribution had outsized impact: \u201cWithout U.S. support in places like Gaza and Syria, the world will become a more dangerous place.\"",
      "In one camp that had been served by a Doctors of the World clinic, near Kawkaba village, children played among the crowded tents.",
      "Camp director Abdelkareem Khaled said the suspension of aid has exacerbated already difficult conditions.",
      "\u201cPatients, especially those who need medicine every month, can no longer afford it at the pharmacy,\u201d he said, leaving those with chronic diseases like diabetes with wrenching decisions to make.",
      "In one tent, Bassam Hussein, father of 4 daughters. said he was forced to pull his 12-year-old daughter out of school so she could work in an almond field to help pay for the medicine he uses for his thyroid illness.",

      "Other organizations are in limbo. Some have continued providing services without knowing where they will find the money.",
      "Dr. Mufaddal Hamadeh, president of the Syrian American Medical Society, which runs hospitals and mobile clinics across the north, said some services had to continue, such as the maternity ward and incubators. But it's unclear how long that will remain sustainable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not certain if we\u2019ll get a waiver or reimbursement for the expenses we\u2019ve already covered,\" he said, referring to the U.S. government. \u201dThat already put a huge financial burden on us.\u201d He refused to give details.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has issued a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs. But Hamadeh and others said funding has not resumed to a point that would allow them to fully restore services.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to shut down some of these hospitals and shrink,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be providing free services anymore.\"",
      "Some programs, such as mental health support for refugees in Turkey and an autism center for children, may not be deemed life-saving.",
      "\u201cWe have a grant that supports survivors of torture and sexual assault,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cAre these services life-saving or not? Likely they will be shut down.\u201d",
      "USAID and the U.S. government did not respond to questions. Elsewhere, USAID workers and aid officials have said funding hasn't resumed despite waivers, or USAID staffers who would process them are now gone.",
      "SAMS relies on USAID for about 25 to 30% of its funds. It's significant, but some other organizations working in Syria receive much more.",
      "Doctors of the World's Istanbul office, which oversees operations in northern Syria, was receiving 60% of its funding from USAID.",
      "Sitting in a new, downsized office, Turkish branch director Hakan Bilgin recalled the day they were told to halt services.",
      "\u201cWe just received the stop-work order suddenly. Nobody was expecting it,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a medical organization providing life-saving services, you\u2019re basically telling us: Close all the clinics, stop all your doctors, and you\u2019re not providing services to women, children, and the elderly.\u201d",
      "Bilgin said his group has cut its daily consultations across northern Syria from 5,000 to 500. The organization has applied for a waiver from the U.S. but has received no response.",

      "\u201cIn the next five years, we could have 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths,\u201d the U.N. AIDS agency told The Associated Press. That's a shock at a time of rising complacency around HIV, declining condom use among some young people and the rise of a medication that some believe could end AIDS for good.",
      "The agency has begun publicly tracking new HIV infections since the aid freeze.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what happens to the body when HIV drugs are stopped:",
      "HIV is spread by bodily fluids such as blood, breast milk or semen. It gradually weakens the body\u2019s immune system and makes it vulnerable to disease, including ones rarely seen in otherwise healthy people. The surprising emergence of such cases in the 1980s is what tipped off health experts to what became known as the AIDS epidemic.",
      "Years of intense advocacy and shocking sights of children, young adults and others dying of pneumonia and other infections led to the response that created PEPFAR, the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Twenty million people around the world died before the program was founded. Now millions of people take drugs known as antivirals that keep HIV from spreading in the body.",
      "Stopping those drugs lets the virus start multiplying in the body again, and it could become drug-resistant. HIV can rebound to detectable levels in people\u2019s blood in just a few weeks, putting sexual partners at risk. Babies born to mothers with HIV can escape infection only if the woman was properly treated during pregnancy or the infant is treated immediately after birth.",
      "If the drugs are not taken, a body is heading toward AIDS, the final stage of infection.",
      "\u201cWithout HIV treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "For a long time, there may be no noticeable symptoms. But a person can easily spread HIV to others, and the immune system becomes vulnerable to what are called opportunistic diseases.",
      "The National Institutes of Health says opportunistic diseases include fungal infections, pneumonia, salmonella and tuberculosis. For a country like South Africa, with the world\u2019s highest number of HIV cases and one of the largest numbers of TB cases, the toll could be immense.",
      "Unchecked by HIV treatment, the damage continues. The immune system is increasingly unable to fight off diseases. Every action, from eating to travel, must consider the potential exposure to germs.",
      "For years, the importance of taking the drugs every day, even at the same time of day, has been emphasized to people with HIV. Now the ability to follow that essential rule has been shaken.",
      "Already, hundreds or thousands of U.S.-funded health partners in countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia have been laid off, causing widespread gaps in HIV testing, messaging, care and support on the continent most helped by PEPFAR. At some African clinics, people with HIV have been turned away.",
      "Restoring the effects caused by the Trump administration's foreign aid freeze during a 90-day review period, and understanding what\u2019s allowed under the waiver for PEPFAR, will take time that health experts say many people don't have.",
      "Meanwhile, the head of the U.N. AIDS agency, Winnie Byanyima, told the AP that more resistant strains of the disease could emerge.",
      "And an additional 3.4 million children could be made orphans \u2014 another echo of the time when the world raced to confront AIDS with few tools at hand.",

      "VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- The man appointed by the Canadian government to help stop fentanyl from entering the United States said his goal is to totally eliminate the drug crossing the border.",
      "\u201cGetting the number to zero is a goal and should be our goal,\u201d Kevin Brosseau, a former member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a former national security and intelligence adviser, said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s one pound, 10 pounds, we all know the amount of deaths that possibly could represent. We should be focused on eliminating the scourge that is fentanyl in this country and in the United States,\u201d he said.",
      "The Canadian government announced Brosseau\u2019s appointment as its fentanyl czar Tuesday.",
      "The move was partly in response to President Donald Trump saying the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the U.S. was a reason for threatening to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian goods \u2013 with an exception of 10% on energy.",
      "Trump has paused the implementation of those tariffs until at least March 4.",
      "\u201cThis is a clear demonstration of how serious Canada is taking the fentanyl crisis in his country and how important our relationship is with our American counterparts,\u201d said Brosseau, who was speaking after touring a Canada Border Services Agency port of entry facility in Lansdowne, Ontario.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m hoping to be able to give an intensity to the work,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mandate is clear, to be able to bring people together to integrate the work and produce results.\u201d",
      "Figures from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) show the agency seized 19.5 kilograms (43 pounds) of fentanyl at the northern border last year. That compares to 9,570 kilograms (21,098 pounds) at the southwestern border.",
      "Brosseau spent more than 20 years in the RCMP, where he served as a deputy commissioner and the senior Mountie in the province of Manitoba. More recently, he was deputy national security and intelligence adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Brosseau said he plans on meeting with Tom Homan, Trump\u2019s border czar, and other U.S. officials soon.",

      "A new study suggests that medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol",
      "Medications that have transformed the treatment of obesity may also help people drink less alcohol, according to new government-funded research.",
      "The study was small \u2014 just 48 adults \u2014 and lasted just over two months, so it\u2019s not the final word. Experts say it\u2019s not yet clear how safe these drugs are for people who don\u2019t need to lose weight.",
      "But the results add to evidence from animal studies and reports that people are finding drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy helpful to manage cravings, not just for food, but also for tobacco and alcohol. Scientists are studying these drugs in smokers, people with opioid addiction and cocaine users.",
      "\u201cThis is such promising data. And we need more of it,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Klara Klein, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who treats patients with diabetes and obesity. \u201cWe frequently will hear that once people start these medications that their desire to drink is very reduced, if not completely abolished.\"",
      "The drugs, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. The new study looked at one of these drugs, semaglutide, which is the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy.",
      "The research, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, was funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the National Institutes of Health.",
      "There are already three medications approved to treat alcohol use disorder, so until larger studies can confirm the findings, people should talk to their doctor about what's already available, said lead author Christian Hendershot, an addiction researcher at University of Southern California.",
      "For the new study, researchers recruited people who reported symptoms of alcohol use disorder, such as difficulty controlling their drinking, but weren\u2019t actively seeking treatment for it.",
      "First, each person came to a lab where they were served their favorite alcoholic beverage and could drink as much as they wanted over two hours.",
      "Then, researchers randomly assigned half the people to get a weekly injection of semaglutide. The other half got sham injections.",
      "For nine weeks, everyone kept track of their drinking habits and their desire for alcohol. A lab visit with their favorite alcohol was repeated at the end of the study.",
      "During the last weeks of the study, nearly 40% in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days compared with 20% in the placebo group. And in the final lab test, the semaglutide group drank roughly half the amount, on average, compared to those who got the placebo.",
      "Everyone in the study was overweight. It's unclear how safe the drugs would be for a person of normal weight, Klein said.",
      "Smokers in the study who got the semaglutide also cut back on cigarettes, noted Luba Yammine of UTHealth Houston, who is leading other research on GLP-1 drugs for people who want to quit smoking. The finding is promising but more data is needed, Yammine said.",
      "The study \u201cprovides additional important information on the potential role of this new class of medications\u201d in treating certain addictions, said Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher who is leading a 20-week trial of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder now underway in Baltimore.",
      "\u201cIt is important to keep in mind that we need larger randomized clinical trials to confirm these findings,\u201d Leggio said.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state\u2019s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- With a heartbeat abortion ban solidly in place in South Carolina, lawyers for the state and Planned Parenthood return to the state's highest court Wednesday to argue how restrictive the ban should be.",
      "The law is being enforced in South Carolina as a ban on almost all abortions around six weeks after conception, setting that mark as the time cardiac activity starts.",
      "But Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are arguing the 2023 law includes alternative definitions about the timing of a fetal heart forming and a \u201cheartbeat\u201d starting and the true ban should start around nine or 10 weeks.",
      "Both sides are set to argue for just over an hour at the South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. The justices likely will take several months to decide the case. In the meantime, the abortion ban around six weeks likely will remain in place after a lower court upheld it.",
      "The 2023 law says abortions cannot be performed after an ultrasound can detect \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d",
      "South Carolina and several other states place that at six weeks into development. But what follows the \u201cor\u201d in the sentence could require that a heart has formed, and medical experts say that doesn\u2019t happen until around nine weeks.",
      "The legal fight has been brewing since the state Supreme Court reversed itself after overturning a similar ban in 2021. The Republican-dominated General Assembly then made small changes and a justice who voted in the majority in the 3-2 decision to overturn the ban reached retirement age and was replaced.",
      "In the decision upholding the new ban, the state Supreme Court itself noted the different definitions saying resolving them would be a question \u201cfor another day.\u201d",
      "That day is Wednesday. Since then, more inconsistencies in the law\u2019s language have been brought up. The law refers to a fetal heartbeat, but most experts consider a fertilized egg to be an embryo for about 10 weeks after conception before transitioning into a fetus.",
      "Lawyers for the state said the parsing of the language ignores the intent of the Legislature. Both supporters and opponents of the bill called it nearly exclusively a six-week ban during debate in the House and Senate.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and South Carolina and three others have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy -- often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by South Carolina resident Taylor Shelton, who said she had sought medical attention for pain from her intrauterine device and was stunned to find out, just two days after missing her regularly-tracked period, that she was pregnant.",
      "She ended up in North Carolina, driving for hours to several appointments to undergo an abortion because doctors in South Carolina were unsure how to define a heartbeat. Shelton couldn\u2019t be completely sure she was within six weeks.",
      "Some Republicans in South Carolina are also pushing for an outright abortion ban, but while legislation was introduced this January when the General Assembly started its two-year session, no hearings have been held."

      "Lawmakers in some states are pushing measures to crack down on abortion pills or penalize women who obtain abortions",
      "Lawmakers in some states where abortion is already banned are seeking to explicitly bar abortion pills or take a step that most leading anti-abortion groups oppose: punish women who seek to end their pregnancies.",
      "It's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand:",
      "Lawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions \u2014 as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.",
      "Louisiana last year became the first state to adopt such a law, despite concerns from doctors who contended that the restrictions would make it harder for them to access the drugs to perform life-saving procedures.",
      "The measures have been introduced in states where Republicans control the government and where there are bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.",
      "The legislation has died or appears unlikely to advance in Indiana and Mississippi.",
      "Elsewhere \u2014 including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas \u2014 it's too early to know whether they have a chance.",
      "In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch opponent of abortion, has vowed to sign any anti-abortion measure that comes to his desk.",
      "And one scholar who follows abortion policy said that the bills can affect the debate even if they don't pick up momentum.",
      "\u201cThe more often that they\u2019re introduced, the more normalized these sorts of bills and these sorts of concepts that they\u2019re pushing become,\u201d said Laura Hermer, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota.",
      "Authorities in two states with stringent abortion laws have targeted a New York doctor for allegedly sending abortion pills to patients in those states.",
      "Last month, a Louisiana grand jury indicted Dr. Maggie Carpenter on charges of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Carpenter in civil court under similar circumstances.",
      "The legal actions set up a test of laws in some Democratic-controlled states, including New York, that seek to protect health care providers who use telehealth to prescribe and then mail abortion pills to patients in states where they're banned. New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.",
      "Since Carpenter's indictment, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law that allows doctors to leave their names off prescription bottles for abortion pills as a way to further insulate them. Similar legislation has been introduced in Maine.",
      "The attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are also suing in federal court to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone and bar prescriptions for it by telehealth.",
      "Some advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.",
      "While critics say the drugs are unsafe, some major medical groups disagree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective. The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone\u2019s safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.",
      "Bills in several states would open the door to criminal charges against women who seek or obtain abortions on charges including murder.",
      "That's a step no state has taken so far, and which leading anti-abortion groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the National Right to Life Committee oppose.",
      "Still, such bills have been introduced in Idaho and Indiana, where they're unlikely to advance, and Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Carolina, where they're all early in the legislative process.",

    "story": [
      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

      "Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them",
      "PHOENIX -- Lawyers for 25,000 people incarcerated in Arizona have asked a judge to take over health care operations in state-run prisons and appoint an official to run them, saying the state is not capable of fixing deep failures in care even though it has been required to do so over the last decade.",
      "In a filing Tuesday, the attorneys said a takeover is urgently needed because the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry lacks the leadership to comply with changes ordered by a judge in a 2012 lawsuit over the quality of medical and mental health care for prisoners.",
      "The first constitutional violation in the case was found in 2015, they said, and \u201cA decade later, defendants still have not demonstrated the will, knowledge, or capacity to reform their prison healthcare system.\u201d",
      "Arizona settled the case in 2014 but for years was dogged by complaints that it failed to follow through on its promises. The court slapped the state with contempt fines of $1.4 million in 2018 and $1.1 million in 2021. The settlement was eventually thrown out due to Arizona\u2019s noncompliance, and a trial was ordered.",
      "In a blistering 2022 verdict, U.S. District Court Judge Roslyn Silver ruled that the state was violating prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights by providing them with inadequate care, knew about the problem for years and refused to correct it.",
      "She also said prison health care deficiencies resulted in preventable deaths and issued an injunction requiring corrections authorities to fix the constitutional violations.",
      "In September 2019 lawyers representing the prisoners made a similar request for a takeover, also known as a receivership. Though Silver has previously shied away from granting that, she later said she would revive that possibility if the state acts in bad faith or fails to comply with the court-ordered changes.",
      "Lawyers for prisoners pointed to a recent report from a court-appointed expert who said health care for prisoners \u201cremains poor, has shown little improvement since the start of the Injunction, and continues to place the residents at significant risk of serious harm, including death.\u201d",
      "The corrections department and Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs' office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on the request.",
      "Past receiverships have been ordered for prisons in other states. In California in 2005, a federal judge seized control of the prison medical system after finding that an average of one inmate a week was dying of medical neglect or malpractice.",
      "The Arizona lawsuit does not cover the nearly 10,000 people incarcerated in private prisons for state convictions."

      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

      "\"I'm not exactly sure, because I'm not in there. I mean, it is difficult to integrate them ...\" he replied, ultimately saying, \"I do not know the answer to that. I look forward to exploring options.\"",
      "",
      "Kennedy also said that Medicare beneficiaries would \"rather be on Medicare Advantage because it offers very good services. People can't afford it. It's much more expensive.\"",
      "",
      "In fact, MA plan beneficiaries generally pay no or very low premiums and choose their plans because of low or non-existent upfront costs. However, it is true that MA plans generally cost the trust fund a lot more than if the same beneficiaries were in traditional Medicare  --  $82 billion more in 2023 according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.",
      "",
      "At another point, Kennedy said that Medicaid is \"fully paid for by the federal government,\" when in fact it is paid through a mix of state and federal money, with states contributing between 17% and 41% in fiscal year 2023. That's an important concept to understand, since each Medicaid program's coverage and eligibility requirements can vary enormously through complex federal waiver programs run by HHS agencies.",
      "",
      "The American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) held a joint media briefing Wednesday after the hearing, questioning Kennedy's fitness to run the agency, which has 13 separate and important divisions, thousands of programs, and 80,000 employees.",
      "",
      "\"... [H]e demonstrated that he did not have a lot of health experience, and in many of his answers, we saw that he has a ... dearth of management experience,\" said Georges Benjamin, MD, executive director of APHA.",
      "",
      "Benjamin noted that it's important for someone in this position to be \"rigorous about scientific evidence, not cherry pick, and understand things like healthcare financing, which he truly did not know the difference between Medicaid and the health exchanges.\"",
      "",
      "\"He talked about copayments and premiums that were too high for Medicaid when Medicaid doesn't have premiums to start with,\" Benjamin said. Also, \"he made a statement about the fact that NIH (National Institutes of Health) doesn't spend a lot of money on chronic diseases, which is absolutely not true.\"",
      "",
      "Benjamin was asked  --  given the number of Kennedy's misstatements  --  whether he at this point in the process should be better informed about Medicare and Medicaid, and problems with programs for dual eligibles.",
      "",
      "\"He did not understand any of that,\" Benjamin replied. \"And you know, this is not rocket science. ... [HHS] does a lot of things, but I said earlier that the nation spends $5 trillion [on healthcare] and we're at the bottom of the other industrialized nations in terms of health outcomes. There's a lot of reasons for that, but he ain't the guy to fix that because he really doesn't know. He doesn't even understand the basics of what the department does.\"",
      "",
      "Julie Sweetland, PhD, senior advisor at the Frameworks Institute, which conducts research on social issues and language, said during the briefing that Kennedy conveyed \"quite a few instances of disinformation.\"",
      "",
      "Multiple times, he suggested \"that most Americans are not happy with Medicaid, although some of his comments suggested that perhaps he was unclear on what Medicaid was. ... In fact, we know that more than 8 in 10 Medicaid enrollees rate the overall performance of Medicaid positively, according to a 2023 KFF poll.\"",
      "",
      "Susan Kressly, MD, president of AAP, was asked about Kennedy's statement to the committee that, \"Most experts agree today, even the people who did it back then, COVID vaccines are inappropriate for 6-year-old children who basically have zero risk of COVID.\"",
      "",
      "Such remarks, along with Kennedy's often-repeated opposition to other vaccinations  --  which he now denies  --  raise concerns that he would find ways to discourage immunizations, perhaps by not requiring that they be covered as an essential benefit by Medicare or health plans.",
      "",
      "Kressly said that Kennedy is wrong, as children can experience complications of COVID months after they recover, she said. Also, they \"tend to be spreaders of infectious illnesses because they're not very good at blowing their nose and keeping their germs to themselves,\" which can affect their family members, schools, and communities, she said.",
      "",
      "\"COVID is not something that does not affect children at all,\" she said. \"In fact, it has enormous impacts.\""

      "",
      "Trump is not alone in his antipathy to teleworking for federal workers. Last December, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) released a report stating that only 6% of federal workers were in the office full-time; the report was titled \"Out of Office: Bureaucrats on the beach and in bubble baths but not in office buildings.\" Ernst's percentage was very much at odds with a 2024 OMB report  --  which has since been removed from the OMB website  --  that found that 54% of federal employees work in the office full-time, while the other 46% of the federal workforce is telework eligible, according to a story on the Meritalk website. Only 10% of federal employees \u2013 228,000 people \u2013 are in fully remote jobs.",
      "",
      "Generally Popular With Both Parties",
      "",
      "Overall, however, telework actually has been popular on both sides of the aisle, Max Stier, president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said last month on a phone call with reporters: \"There has been bipartisan support for telework in the federal space for many, many years, because it's been shown to  --  when well-applied  --  provide both for better performance and improved ability to recruit the best talent for federal positions.\" The Partnership for Public Service says its aim is to build \"a better government and a stronger democracy.\"",
      "",
      "In the past few years, \"there's obviously been a push to try to move people in the federal space back into the office,\" Stier continued. \"The Biden administration actually pushed aggressively to try to make that happen. ... Some organizations like the Patent and Trademark Office have been high performing virtually exclusively. ... We know it's really important to understand that you have those [telework] components that have been working very well, even pre-pandemic, and you wouldn't want to disrupt them, because that would have very negative consequences for the American people.\"",
      "",
      "The in-office order comes as the General Services Administration announced plans to significantly reduce the federal government's real estate footprint. \"One of the things that our government has become is more efficient with respect to cost, in terms of its physical footprint, as a result of increased use of telework and remote work,\" said Stier. \"So those things do run in conflict with each other, and certainly it's so important to understand the transition needs of any organization.\"",
      "",
      "Like everyone else in the federal workforce, HHS's more than 80,000 employees  --  several of whom spoke to MedPage Today on condition of anonymity  --  are trying to figure out how the back-to-work order will be implemented in their specific situation. The agency consists of workers assigned to the HHS headquarters office in Washington as well as 10 regional offices spread throughout the U.S., and lingering logistical questions remain. Some who have previously worked at the Washington headquarters, for example, say there is likely not enough interior space or parking to accommodate all of the employees if everyone now assigned there were to return full-time.",
      "",
      "One employee working in a different location said they had heard that supervisors were going to have to return to work full-time sooner than non-supervisory employees, and that there might still be some \"ad hoc\" telework agreements. There may not be enough space for everyone to be in their building, the employee said.",
      "",
      "Still another employee said that their colleagues were \"none too pleased\" to hear about the back-to-office-full-time requirement, noting that the rule appeared to supersede other arrangements in which people could, for instance, work four 10-hour days and get the fifth day off. \"This is an imperious, dictatorial, tin-ear approach to management,\" the person said. \"It's not about efficiency; it's just about vindictiveness. There are ways to achieve the overall goal of serving the American people well, but this is not that.\"",
      "",
      "Changes to Work/Life Balance",
      "",
      "With this change, \"people's work/life balance is about to be completely tipped over,\" the person continued. They noted that \"the flexibility of remote work allowed them to create lives where they were much more productive as parents and still got their work done; if they had to do a carpool at 3 p.m., they could do that and work into the evening. I would get emails from people who were still working at 7 or 8 p.m. But you can't do that if you're in the office 5 days a week with inflexible workplace rules.\"",
      "",
      "Another employee said that telework made it easier to work longer hours when necessary. Before telework, \"it would take me an hour to get into work in the morning and maybe 90 minutes or longer to get home in the afternoon,\" they said, explaining that they worked a 7 a.m.-to-3:30 p.m. shift. But with telework, \"I could work before 7 or after 3:30, and that has happened commonly  --  things come up and require more than just the 8 hours that you do on Monday through Friday.\"",
      "",
      "One thing that might affect whether and when HHS employees return to the office full-time is any collective bargaining agreements that employee unions have with the federal government. \"In the OPM memo, they indicated that there were some issues that need to be resolved through the collective bargaining process before employees that were represented by the unions could actually return to the office,\" the employee added. Several unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union, represent different swaths of HHS employees.",

      "Hamas militants have named the next three Israeli male hostages to be released as part of a fragile ceasefire deal that had teetered in recent days amid a major dispute that raised the specter of fighting resuming in the devastated Gaza Strip",
      "JERUSALEM -- Hamas militants on Friday named three Israeli male hostages to be released at the weekend as part of a fragile ceasefire deal that had teetered in recent days amid a major dispute that raised the specter of fighting resuming in the devastated Gaza Strip.",
      "Hamas and a forum representing families of hostages identified the three to be freed Saturday as Israeli-Argentinian Iair Horn, 46; Israeli-American Sagui Dekel Chen, 36; and Israeli-Russian Alexander (Sasha) Troufanov, 29. The trio were abducted from the same hard-hit kibbutz during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.",
      "Under the terms of the ceasefire, which began on Jan. 21, Israel is to release more than 300 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails in return for the hostages. The exchange will be the sixth swap since the ceasefire came into effect.",
      "So far, 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners have been freed during the first phase of the truce. But the ceasefire had appeared dangerously close to collapse in recent days.",
      "Hamas had said it would delay the next hostage release after accusing Israel of not adhering to the terms of the deal by not allowing enough shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble into Gaza.",
      "Israel, with the support of U.S. President Donald Trump, had retorted it would resume fighting Saturday unless hostages were freed - leaving it unclear whether it meant the three hostages as scheduled in the ceasefire deal, or all remaining hostages.",
      "An Israeli government official on Friday confirmed Israel had received the list of hostages to be released. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.",
      "Horn, Dekel Chen and Troufanov were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where some 80 of roughly 400 residents were taken hostage during the Oct. 7, 2023 attack.",
      "Horn was taken along with his brother, Eitan Horn, who had been staying with him at the time. Eitan remains in captivity.",
      "Dekel Chen had been working on a bus renovation when militants stormed the kibbutz. His wife, Avital, who was seven months pregnant at the time, hid in a safe room with their two daughters. Avital has since given birth to a third daughter while her husband has been in captivity.",
      "Troufanov was taken hostage along with his grandmother Irena Tati, mother Yelena (Lena) and girlfriend Sapir Cohen. The three women were released during a brief ceasefire in November 2023. Troufanov's father was killed in the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "Of the 251 people abducted, 73 remain in Gaza, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Nearly all the remaining hostages are men, including Israeli soldiers.",
      "Concern has been growing about the remaining hostages' condition, particularly after the release of three last Saturday, who emerged looking emaciated and frail.",
      "One of them, 65-year-old Keith Siegel, said in a video message addressed to Trump Friday that his captors had starved him and physically and emotionally tortured him.",
      "He said the militants who held him for 484 days treated him worse as the 15-month war intensified, kicking him, spitting on him and holding him with no water or light. The statement marked one of the first accounts of Hamas captivity from a hostage released during the ceasefire.",
      "\u201cWhen I was in Gaza, I lived in constant fear...for my life and my personal safety,\u201d he said.",
      "Siegel, originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, implored Trump to use his \u201cleadership and strength\u201d to ensure the ceasefire holds and all hostages return home.",
      "The truce faces a much bigger challenge in the coming weeks. The first phase is set to conclude at the beginning of March, and there have not yet been substantive negotiations over the second phase, in which Hamas would release all remaining hostages in return for an end to the war.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them in other countries has thrown the truce\u2019s future into further doubt.",
      "His plan has been welcomed by Israel, but vehemently rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries which have refused to accept any influx of refugees. Human rights groups say it could amount to a war crime under international law.",
      "Trump has said Gaza\u2019s population should be resettled elsewhere in the region, with wealthy Arab countries paying for it. He has suggested that once the fighting ends, Israel would transfer control of Gaza to the United States, which would then redevelop it as the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right allies are already calling for a resumption of the war after the first phase with the goal of implementing Trump\u2019s plan and annihilating Hamas, which remains in control of the territory after surviving one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history.",
      "Hamas may be unwilling to release any more hostages if it believes the war will resume. The captives are among the only bargaining chips it has left.",
      "The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has obliterated large parts of Gaza. At its height, the fighting had displaced 90% of the territory\u2019s population of 2.3 million. Hundreds of thousands have returned to their homes since the ceasefire took hold, though many have found only rubble, buried human remains and unexploded ordnance.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, echoing Trump, said Wednesday that \u201call hell will break loose\u201d if Hamas stops releasing hostages. He said a \u201cnew Gaza war\u201d wouldn\u2019t end until Hamas was defeated, which would allow for Trump\u2019s vision of mass displacement to be carried out.",
      "With far fewer hostages remaining in Gaza, Israel would have more freedom of action militarily.",
      "It would also face far fewer constraints from the United States, its main military patron. The Biden administration, while providing crucial military and diplomatic support, had occasionally pressed Israel to allow in more aid and at one point suspended some weapons shipments. It had also said there should be no permanent displacement of its Palestinian population.",
      "Trump has lifted restrictions on arms transfers, and his administration is pressing ahead with the sale of $7 billion worth of weapons approved under President Joe Biden.",

      "The Europeans began exploring what kind of force might be needed about a year ago, but the sense of urgency has grown amid concern that U.S. President Donald Trump might go over their heads, and possibly even Ukraine\u2019s, to clinch a deal with Putin.",
      "Many questions remain unanswered but one stands out: what role, if any, might the United States play?",
      "In December, after Trump was elected but before he took office, a group of leaders and ministers huddled with Zelenskyy at NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte\u2019s residence in Brussels. They came from Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland. Top European Union officials attended too.",
      "The talks built on an idea promoted by French President Emmanuel Macron in early 2024. At the time his refusal to rule out putting troops on the ground in Ukraine prompted an outcry, notably from the leaders of Germany and Poland.",
      "Macron appeared isolated on the European stage, but his plan has gained traction since.",
      "Still, much about what the force might look like and who will take part will depend on the terms of any peace settlement, and more.",
      "Italy has constitutional limits on the use of its forces. The Netherlands would need a greenlight from its parliament, as would Germany, whose position could evolve after the Feb. 23 elections usher in a new government. Poland is cautious, given lingering animosities with Ukraine that date from World War II.",
      "The makeup and role of the force will be dictated by the kind of peace deal that\u2019s reached. If Russia and Ukraine can agree terms as the negotiations progress, it\u2019s plausible that fewer security precautions and a smaller force would be needed.",
      "But experts and officials warn that, as things stand, the Europeans must deploy a robust and sizeable contingent, rather than a team of peacekeepers like United Nations \u201cblue helmets.\u201d",

And you can be sure that Russia will test it,\u201d Ben Hodges, the former Commanding General of U.S. Army Europe, said last month at a European Policy Centre think tank event.",
      "\u201cThey violate every single agreement. So if we send a force in there, they\u2019ve got to have airpower, large land forces, drones, counter-drones, air and missile defense. All of that,\" he said. \"If they go in there with a bunch of blue helmets and rifles, they will get crushed.\u201d",
      "Retired French General Dominique Trinquand, a former head of France\u2019s military mission at the United Nations, agreed that U.N. peacekeepers are better suited \u201cfor deployment in zones that are far more stable.\"",
      "\u201cFor starters, mounting this operation with soldiers taken from across the world would take about a year,\u201d he said.",
      "The nature of the peace deal will determine the size and location of the European contingent. Zelenskyy has insisted on at least 100,000 to 150,000 troops. Media reports have speculated about a 30,000-40,000 strong force. Diplomats and officials have not confirmed either figure.",
      "Ukraine also wants air support, not just boots on the ground.",
      "What is clear is that the Europeans would struggle to muster a large-scale force, and certainly could not do it quickly.",
      "In an interview on Friday with the Financial Times, Macron said that the idea of deploying a huge force is \u201cfar-fetched.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to do things that are appropriate, realistic, well thought, measured and negotiated,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insisted this week on \u201crobust international oversight of the line of contact,\u201d a reference to the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) long front line. The Europeans are reluctant as that would require too many troops.",
      "Nearly all agree that some kind of \u201cAmerican backstop\u201d is essential. European armed forces have long relied on superior U.S. logistics, air transport and other military capabilities.",
      "At NATO headquarters on Wednesday, Hegseth began describing the terms under which the U.S. might agree to a force that would help provide Ukraine with the \u201crobust security guarantees to ensure that the war will not begin again.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny security guarantee must be backed by capable European and non-European troops,\u201d Hegseth told almost 50 of Ukraine\u2019s Western backers. If they go to Ukraine, he said, \u201cthey should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission.\u201d",

      "Eli Sharabi, 52, had no exposure to media during his 16-month ordeal, according to his brother, Sharon Sharabi.",
      "Forced to speak at a staged Hamas ceremony before his release, a gaunt Sharabi told a crowd of masked militants and journalists that he was looking forward to seeing his wife and two teenage daughters back in Israel.",
      "Then he learned the crushing reality shortly after his arrival in Israel: all three had been killed at home during the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "\u201cBeyond the emotional burden and difficult experiences he faced in captivity, he had to bear this horrible loss on the first day that he left from there,\u201d his brother told Israeli Army Radio.",
      "Or Levy, 34, was dealt a similar blow upon being freed. That is when he learned that his wife, Einav, was killed on Oct. 7.",
      "\u201cFor 491 days, he held onto hope that he would return to her,\u201d his brother, Michael Levy, told reporters.",
      "Levy was reunited with his young son, who hit key developmental milestones, like being potty trained, while his father was in captivity. \u201cIt took you a long time to come back,\u201d the 3-year-old told his father, according to Israeli media.",
      "The first person Keith Siegel asked about upon returning home was his mother, Gladys. When his wife's eyes welled up, he immediately understood she had died, his daughter recounted.",
      "Siegel picked up some information about his family while in captivity. Months into the war, he heard his daughter on the radio, speaking about how his son had survived Hamas' attack. Other freed hostages have also reported hearing messages from their families through the news media.",
      "Yarden Bibas, who was freed earlier this month, was told by his captors that his wife, Shiri, and their two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, were dead. But he was also told they were spotted in Tel Aviv, according to Israeli media.",
      "Now that he is out, he still lacks clarity. They remain in Gaza, and the Israeli government has said it has \u201cserious concern\u201d for their lives.",
      "Beyond their personal lives, freed hostages are also taking in more than a year's worth of world events: President Donald Trump is back in the White House; Israel and Iran engaged in their first direct attacks; Israel killed the longtime chief of the militant group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah.",
      "Keith Siegel's family is sharing information sparingly, as one might with a child. \u201cYou answer only what he asks and not more than that,\u201d his daughter, Elan, said.",
      "But the questions are relentless.",
      "Siegel wanted to know what happened to his community of Kfar Aza. Was anyone watering the plants? Who was killed in Hamas' attack?",
      "\u201cWe asked him if he\u2019s sure that he\u2019s ready. And he said \u2018yes,\u2019 that he just wants to know. So I read him the list of 64 people\" who were killed, his daughter said. She said his reaction to the news has been muted because \u201cit's almost like he forgot how to feel\u201d while in captivity.",
      "Siegel's photo has been a mainstay at protests and on banners highlighting the plight of hostages, making him recognizable across Israel. Ahead of his release, dozens of Israelis posted videos of themselves on social media making his favorite pancake recipe.",
      "Siegel's wife, Aviva, who was freed from captivity in the early weeks of the war, prepared a book for him that includes notes from the important figures she had lobbied on his behalf \u2014 from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to former U.S. President Joe Biden.",
      "Siegel was especially befuddled by the revelation that world leaders knew about his captivity.",
      "His daughter, Elan, recalled him saying: \"If they knew, how can it be that I was there for so long?\u201d",

      "BEIRUT -- Thousands of supporters gathered in downtown Beirut on Friday to commemorate the 20th anniversary of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri\u2019s assassination, which comes amid seismic regional political shifts.",
      "The ousting of Bashar Assad in December after 54 years of family rule in Syria marked the fall of a government long accused of orchestrating Hariri\u2019s assassination and other political killings in Lebanon.",
      "Meanwhile, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah \u2014 whose members were convicted by a U.N.-backed tribunal for their role in Hariri\u2019s murder \u2014 now faces its own turning point following the assassination of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli airstrike in September. Nasrallah\u2019s funeral is set for February 23.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning of justice. If the justice of the earth did not serve us, no one escapes the justice of heaven,\" said Hariri\u2019s son, former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, as he addressed a huge crowd in the capital Beirut.",
      "\"After 20 years, Rafik Hariri\u2019s project is continuing, and those who tried to kill the project, look where they are now,\" Saad added.",
      "Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, appointed in early February, visited Hariri\u2019s burial site earlier Friday.",
      "\u201cToday, we remember the legacy of the great martyr in serving Lebanon, preserving its national unity, and working for its prosperity,\u201d Salam wrote on X. \u201cHe was greatly respected in the Arab world and the world, leaving Lebanon with a remarkable moral and political legacy.\u201d",
      "Lebanon\u2019s president Joseph Aoun also paid tribute to Hariri, saying on X that Hariri's \"national stances were a fundamental building block in strengthening national unity and protecting civil peace.\u201d",
      "Hariri was killed on Feb. 14, 2005, when a massive bomb exploded near the St. Georges Hotel, a historic landmark on Beirut\u2019s waterfront. The blast killed 21 other people and injured over 200.",
      "In 2020, a U.N.-backed tribunal convicted one member of the Hezbollah militant group and acquitted three others of involvement in the assassination. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon said Salim Ayyash was guilty as a co-conspirator of five charges linked to his involvement in the suicide truck bombing.",
      "None of the suspects was ever arrested or attended court to hear the verdicts.",
      "The assassination of Hariri ignited the \u201cCedar Revolution,\u201d leading to massive protests against Syria\u2019s nearly three-decade military presence in Lebanon, ultimately culminating in the withdrawal of Syrian troops in 2005. The assassination also intensified sectarian divisions within Lebanon and bolstered the political influence of Assad's ally, Hezbollah.",
      "Buses from across Lebanon arrived early, bringing supporters to downtown Beirut to commemorate the anniversary. Thousands of people filled the streets and waved Lebanese flags and the blue flag of Hariri's Future Movement to songs honoring Hariri's memory.",
      "\u201cAfter the Syrian and Iranian guardianship ended and the ousting of the Syrian regime, the Lebanese state alone rules us,\u201d Mohammad Kanaan told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIn this square, you expelled Bashar Assad from Lebanon,\u201d Saad said during his speech. \u201cAnd after twenty years of sectarian rule, detention and brutality, the heroic Syrian people rose up and expelled the criminal from Syria.\u201d",
      "Another supporter, Ahmad Serhal, said he hoped that \u201cLebanon would unite\u201d after the departure of Assad. \u201cAll the political shifts are for the good of this country. Lebanon is for all the Lebanese, we need to reach an agreement and unite.\u201d",
      "\u201cGod took revenge upon those who assassinated president Rafik \u2014 from ousting Assad, from ousting the system that is allied with Iran,\u201d Ahmad Trab said. \u201cWe hope for a better future now with Syria.\u201d",
      "The anniversary of Hariri\u2019s death comes just four days before the deadline for Israeli troops to withdraw from southern Lebanon under a ceasefire agreement that ended a 14-month war with Hezbollah in late November. The ceasefire deal also stipulates that Hezbollah must end its military presence south of the Litani River, with the Lebanese Army and UN peacekeepers deploying in the vacated areas.",
      "The pullout deadline, initially set for Jan. 26, was postponed to Feb. 18.",
      "Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said Lebanon \u201cabsolutely rejects\u201d an Israeli proposal to keep troops in five strategic border points after the withdrawal. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the Americans to impose (the withdrawal), otherwise they will have caused the biggest setback for the government,\u201d he said.",
      "Aoun has also insisted that Israel must adhere to the agreed-upon timeline. During his speech, Saad also emphasized the need for the Israeli army's withdrawal from Lebanon.",
      "Saad addressed the people of southern and eastern Lebanon, regions largely supporters of and influenced by Hezbollah, urging them to seize Lebanon\u2019s golden opportunity while dispelling any perception of being \u201ca force of obstruction.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 8, Lebanon formed a new government led by Salam, the first fully empowered administration since 2022. Salam, a former president of the International Court of Justice, was appointed following the election of Aoun in January. The 24-member cabinet includes a mix of technocrats and political figures, representing various sects, including Hezbollah\u2019s allies.",
      "Although Hezbollah did not formally endorse Salam\u2019s appointment, the group negotiated during the government formation process.",
      "The United States has expressed support for the new government, emphasizing the importance of stability and reforms, though opposing Hezbollah\u2019s direct participation in the cabinet. Salam's government now faces Lebanon\u2019s longstanding economic crisis and an urgent need to implement key financial reforms.",
      "The political shift has reopened the door for renewed Arab engagement, particularly from Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which had previously distanced themselves from Lebanon due to the growing influence of Iran and its ally, Hezbollah.",
      "These countries, which had strong ties with Lebanon under Hariri, are now reassessing their approach, with hopes of reintegrating Lebanon into the Arab fold."

      "Philippine authorities raided the syndicate\u2019s hideout near Manila in October, arrested more than 250 mostly Chinese suspected members and seized computers and other gadgets used in the online fraud.",
      "After an investigation, Australian and Philippine police found the syndicate had attempted to victimize about 5,000 people in Australia alone. They were trying to check if those Australians have already been defrauded, Australian Federal Police officer Kathleen Oehlers said in a news conference in Manila with Philippine anti-crime officials.",
      "About $15 million have been lost to such online love scams from victims in Australia last year alone, according to Oehlers.",
      "Under the scheme, the suspects would hunt for potential victims, mostly fully employed males, in online dating apps and then use romantic dialogues to develop a whirlwind romance online. A victim would later be encouraged by a scammer under cover of a fake picture and identity to invest in cryptocurrency, initially with relatively small amounts, before shifting the funds to the syndicate\u2019s account, Oehlers said.",
      "Philippine Undersecretary Gilbert Cruz, who heads the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission, said that aside from publicizing the dialogues used by the syndicate to lure and defraud victims, the Australian police also provided crucial tips online. They included being wary of red flags like \u201coverly affectionate behavior,\u201d he said.",
      "Philippine authorities would take similar steps to foster vigilance, Cruz said.",
      "\"The scammer would portray a kind-hearted Filipino woman living in Australia or a local female resident in the Philippines, heartbroken by an ex-fiance who wanted my money, not my love,\u2019\u201d the statement said.",
      "\"I\u2019m sorry if our first day of chat is very emotional. By the way, how\u2019s your business?\u201d according to one of the scripts used by the syndicate to shift the topic to cryptocurrency investment.",
      "Last year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered the closure of the mostly Chinese-run online gaming operations up to the end of 2024, accusing them of venturing into crimes, including financial scams, human trafficking, torture, kidnappings and murder.",
      "The Chinese-run online gambling outfits were estimated to number more than 400 across the Philippines and employ hundreds of thousands of Chinese and Southeast Asian nationals.",
      "The ban forced many remaining syndicates to break into smaller outfits in the Philippines and diversify their operations into an array of online love, cryptocurrency and investment scams, the Philippine anti-organized crime commission said."

      "As its geostrategic competition with China has grown manifold in recent years, India has diversified defense acquisitions from the U.S., Israel and France while seeking to move toward self-reliance in this sector. But New Delhi is still far from getting over its dependence on supplies and spare parts from Russia that makes up to 60% of Indian defense equipment.",
      "With vast borders and protracted border conflicts with neighboring countries Pakistan and China, India also relies hugely on Moscow for military upgrades and modernization.",
      "\u201cIndia faces threats from China and Pakistan, and a threat from collaborative Pakistan-China. We need technologically capable systems to counter these threats and one country that can give such systems is America,\u201d said Lt. Gen. D.S. Hooda, who from 2014 to 2016 headed the Indian military\u2019s Northern Command.",
      "China\u2019s rise as a global power also has pushed India closer to the U.S. and to the Quad, a new Indo-Pacific strategic alliance among the U.S., India, Australia and Japan.",
      "The growing strategic alliance accuses China of economic coercion and military maneuvering in the region, upsetting the status quo, and has ruffled feathers in Beijing, which sees the relationship as a counterweight against China\u2019s rise.",
      "Indian fears of Chinese territorial expansion are bolstered by the growing presence of the Chinese navy in the Indian Ocean and Beijing\u2019s efforts to strengthen ties with not only Pakistan but also Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.",
      "\u201cThe major threat is from China which is outstripping India\u2019s capability,\u201d Hooda said.",
      "In the early 1990s, about 70% of Indian army weapons, 80% of its air force systems and 85% of its navy platforms were of Soviet origin. From 2016 to 2020, Russia accounted for nearly 49% of India\u2019s defense imports while French and Israeli shares were 18% and 13%, respectively, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.",
      "Major Indian purchases from the U.S. included long-range maritime patrol aircraft, C-130 transport aircraft, missiles and drones.",
      "The defense sales also can potentially offset the trade deficit between the two countries, Hooda said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a win-win for all. America will get more business, and we\u2019ll get modern weapons,\u201d Hooda said. \u201cIt will also help to ease pressure on the tariff issue and trade deficit.\u201d",

      "The 88-year-old pontiff has had a series of other health problems. In addition to having had a large chunk of his large intestine removed in 2021, he now uses a wheelchair, cane or walker because of strained knee ligaments.",

He also has a personal nurse, Massimiliano Strappetti, an employee of the Vatican health system whom Francis credited with saving his life when Strappetti diagnosed the 2021 intestinal problem.",

      "\u2014\u2014",
      "1957: In his native Argentina, Francis, then in his early 20s, suffered from a severe respiratory infection that forced doctors to remove part of one lung. He later recalled that a nurse saved his life at the time, deciding to double the amount of drugs he had been given.",
      "July 4-14, 2021: He spent 10 days in Gemelli hospital in Rome for what the Vatican said was a narrowing of the large intestine. Doctors removed 33 centimeters (13 inches) of his colon.

      "June 7-16, 2023: Francis had abdominal surgery to remove scar tissue and repair an abdominal hernia and was released nine days later. His surgeon, Dr. Sergio Alfieri, revealed that the scarring was not only due to the 2021 abdominal surgery, but to previous surgeries the pope had undergone.",

      "\"If the American president makes peace, if an agreement is made, I think Russia will be reintegrated into the world economy, reintegrated into the European security system, and even European energy,\" said Orb\u00e1n, who is close to Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cThis will give the Hungarian economy a huge boost. It's a big opportunity. We gain a lot in peace.\u201d",
      "A phone call between Trump and Putin on Wednesday, during which they agreed to begin negotiations on ending the war, abruptly ended a three-year, U.S.-led effort to isolate the Russian leader over Ukraine and raised concerns in Kyiv and other European capitals that a negotiated settlement could take place without their direct participation.",
      "But Orb\u00e1n, who has long been critical of Western efforts to support Ukraine's defense and threatened to veto European Union sanctions against Moscow, praised Trump for his discussions with Putin, saying the U.S. president \u201cwants peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe United States has initiated a change that puts the whole Western world\u2019s system of arguments, value system, and way of thinking on a new track,\u201d he said. \u201cThis process is progressing much faster than many people thought. We call this the Trump tornado.\u201d",
      "Hungary, unlike the majority of European countries, has continued to rely heavily on Russian oil and gas even after Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022, and has been a staunch critic of EU sanctions against Russia's energy sector.",
      "On Friday, he predicted the EU would \u201cfall apart\u201d if energy prices across the bloc were not brought down.",
      "\"I personally became convinced in 2010, 2011 that the European Union was done for,\" he said. \u201cIf the Germans and the French do not figure something out and put the European Union on a new trajectory, then its days are numbered. There is no need to leave it, it will fall apart by itself if it goes on like this.\u201d"

      "Researchers who sniffed mummified remains in the name of science were greeted more with a blessing than a curse",
      "LONDON -- At first whiff, it sounds repulsive: sniff the essence of an ancient corpse.",
      "But researchers who indulged their curiosity in the name of science found that well-preserved Egyptian mummies actually smell pretty good.",
      "\u201cIn films and books, terrible things happen to those who smell mummified bodies,\u201d said Cecilia Bembibre, director of research at University College London's Institute for Sustainable Heritage. \u201cWe were surprised at the pleasantness of them.\"",
      "\u201cWoody,\u201d \u201cspicy\u201d and \u201csweet\u201d were the leading descriptions from what sounded more like a wine tasting than a mummy sniffing exercise. Floral notes were also detected, which could be from pine and juniper resins used in embalming.",
      "The study published Thursday in the Journal of the American Chemical Society used both chemical analysis and a panel of human sniffers to evaluate the odors from nine mummies as old as 5,000 years that had been either in storage or on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
      "The researchers wanted to systematically study the smell of mummies because it has long been a subject of fascination for the public and researchers alike, said Bembibre, one of the report\u2019s authors. Archeologists, historians, conservators and even fiction writers have devoted pages of their work to the subject \u2014 for good reason.",
      "Scent was an important consideration in the mummification process that used oils, waxes and balms to preserve the body and its spirit for the afterlife. The practice was largely reserved for pharaohs and nobility and pleasant smells were associated with purity and deities while bad odors were signs of corruption and decay.",
      "Without sampling the mummies themselves, which would be invasive, researchers from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia were able to measure whether aromas were coming from the archaeological item, pesticides or other products used to conserve the remains, or from deterioration due to mold, bacteria or microorganisms.",
      "\u201cWe were quite worried that we might find notes or hints of decaying bodies, which wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d said Matija Strli\u010d, a chemistry professor at the University of Ljubljana. \u201cWe were specifically worried that there might be indications of microbial degradation, but that was not the case, which means that the environment in this museum, is actually quite good in terms of preservation.\u201d",
      "Using technical instruments to measure and quantify air molecules emitted from sarcophagi to determine the state of preservation without touching the mummies was like the Holy Grail, Strli\u010d said.",
      "\"It tells us potentially what social class a mummy was from and and therefore reveals a lot of information about the mummified body that is relevant not just to conservators, but to curators and archeologists as well,\" he said. \u201cWe believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections.\u201d",
      "Barbara Huber, a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany who was not involved in the study, said the findings provide crucial data on compounds that could preserve or degrade mummified remains. The information could be used to better protect the ancient bodies for future generations.",
      "\u201cHowever, the research also underscores a key challenge: the smells detected today are not necessarily those from the time of mummification,\u201d Huber said. \u201cOver thousands of years, evaporation, oxidation, and even storage conditions have significantly altered the original scent profile.\u201d",
      "Huber authored a study two years ago that analyzed residue from a jar that had contained mummified organs of a noblewoman to identify embalming ingredients, their origins and what they revealed about trade routes. She then worked with a perfumer to create an interpretation of the embalming scent, known as \u201cScent of Eternity,\u201d for an exhibition at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark.",
      "Researchers of the current study hope to do something similar, using their findings to develop \u201csmellscapes\u201d to artificially recreate the scents they detected and enhance the experience for future museumgoers.",
      "\u201cMuseums have been called white cubes, where you are prompted to read, to see, to approach everything from a distance with your eyes,\u201d Bembibre said. \u201cObserving the mummified bodies through a glass case reduces the experience because we don\u2019t get to smell them. We don\u2019t get to know about the mummification process in an experiential way, which is one of the ways that we understand and engage with the world.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere can be no negotiation about Ukraine without Ukraine. And Ukraine\u2019s voice must be at the heart of any talks,\u201d U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey told reporters at NATO headquarters as the alliance\u2019s 32 defense ministers met for talks on the war-torn country.",
      "Trump was noncommittal on Wednesday about whether Ukraine would have a seat at the table in U.S. negotiations with Russia. But asked by reporters Thursday, Trump said, \u201cOf course they would. I mean, they\u2019re part of it. We would have Ukraine, we have Russia and we\u2019ll have other people involved, too.\u201d",
      "He also noted that representatives from Russia would be at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "Both Trump and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth dashed Ukraine\u2019s hopes this week of becoming part of NATO, which the alliance said less than a year ago was \u201cirreversible,\u201d or getting back its territory captured by Russia, which currently occupies close to 20% including Crimea.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see any way that a country in Russia\u2019s position could allow ... them to join NATO,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d",
      "Asked what he thought Russia should give up to reach a deal, he noted that talks have not yet begun and that \u201cmaybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won\u2019t.\u201d",
      "At NATO headquarters, Hegseth reiterated Thursday that \u201csimply pointing out realism like the borders won\u2019t be rolled back to what everybody would like them to be in 2014 is not a concession to Vladimir Putin.\u201d He said it\u2019s a recognition of realities on the ground.",
      "He added, though, that neither Russia nor Ukraine will \u201cget everything that they want\u201d and stressed that \u201cany negotiation that\u2019s had will be had with both.\u201d",
      "Rubio also told Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha in a call before leaving for Munich that the U.S. was committed to Ukrainian independence. He reiterated \u201cthe need for bold diplomacy to end the war in a negotiated manner leading to a sustainable peace,\u201d according to a State Department readout.",
      "Vance, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said that the U.S. would hit Moscow with sanctions and potentially military action if Putin won\u2019t agree to a peace deal with Ukraine that guarantees Kyiv\u2019s long-term independence.",
      "The warning that military options \u201cremain on the table\u201d was striking language from a Trump administration that\u2019s repeatedly underscored a desire to quickly end the war.",
      "\u201cThere are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,\u201d Vance added.",
      "The U.S. reassurances may have somewhat allayed Zelenskyy\u2019s fears, although they will not replace any lost military or economic support that the Biden administration had provided.",
      "The Ukrainian leader conceded Thursday that it was \u201cnot very pleasant\u201d that the American president spoke first to Putin. But he said the main issue was to \u201cnot allow everything to go according to Putin\u2019s plan.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cannot accept it, as an independent country, any agreements (made) without us,\u201d Zelenskyy said as he visited a nuclear power plant in western Ukraine.",
      "The track Trump is taking also has rocked Europe, much as his dismissive comments about France and Germany did during his first term.",
      "French Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Haddad described Europe as being at a turning point, with the ground shifting rapidly under its feet, and said Europe must wean itself off its reliance on the United States for its security. He warned that handing a victory to Russia in Ukraine could have repercussions in Asia, too.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re not sufficiently grasping the extent to which our world is changing. Both our competitors and our allies are busy accelerating,\u201d Haddad told broadcaster France Info on Thursday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not just the interests of Ukraine and the Europeans. Everyone would lose, starting with the United States. And I think the United States know that,\u201d he said.",
      "But Trump said Thursday that he trusts that Putin wants to find an end to the war.",
      "\u201cI trust him on the subject,\" the U.S. president offered. \u201cI think he\u2019d like to see something happen.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:35:21 -0500",
    "summary": "This Valentine's Day Kenya's flower industry is being ravaged by pests, leading some flower farmers to rely more heavily on toxic pesticides",
    "story": [
      "This Valentine's Day Kenya's flower industry is being ravaged by pests, leading some flower farmers to rely more heavily on toxic pesticides",
      "ISINYA, Kenya -- The red rose: a token of love for many, and for Kenya, a major economic sector. More than a third of Kenya's flower exports where the roses, in particular, are prized for their longevity and vase performance, the Kenyan government says.",
      "What can\u2019t be seen within these uniformly perfect blooms is a tiny larva laid inside the rosebuds, laid by the false codling moth (Thaumatotibia leucotreta), which doesn\u2019t just feed on roses but can also affect fruits and vegetables.",
      "The moth has been devastating crops across Africa. The European Union is intensifying measures to prevent its spread into Europe, classifying FCM among organisms targeted for regulation as quarantine pests, with consequences for hard-pressed Kenyan farmers.",
      "According to the Kenya Flower Council, the detection of a single live FCM at any developmental stage leads to the rejection of an entire flower consignment.",
      "\u201cThey are too strict,\u201d laments Jacky Mwanzia, a marketer with Isinya Roses in Kajiado County, south of Nairobi. \u201cMost of our shipments to the EU are quarantined, and it takes time. It is a waste because we have to meet customers\u2019 demand, so we are looking for alternative markets where these measures are not too strict, as we lose about 30% of our revenue.\u201d",
      "Nationally, the flower industry employs half a million people, according to a Central Bank of Kenya 2021 report, and is estimated by the National Bureau of Statistics to be worth over $800 million. Roses make up about 66% of cut flower exports, at an estimated value of about $300 million.",
      "The Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) reports that since 2020, EU sampling of Kenyan roses has increased from 5% to 25%, leading to more frequent quarantines and shipment returns.",
      "Despite existing stringent protocols, the EU is expected to enforce even tougher restrictions in the coming months. Due to ongoing noncompliance by exporters, the EU will impose special requirements applicable to Kenyan cut roses, reports the Committee Linking Entrepreneurship, Agriculture, and Development, a French-based network of companies that engages in sustainable agriculture. These new rules take effect on Apr. 26, 2025.",
      "Kenya\u2019s warm climate and soils are ideal for growing roses but also favor pests, so pesticides are routinely used to minimize losses. A 2020 study by the Route To Food Initiative of the Nairobi branch of the Heinrich Boell Foundation, a non-profit, found that 75% of pesticides used in Kenya are highly hazardous. Nearly half are banned in the EU but are still used in Kenya largely due to lower regulatory standards.",
      "Farmers who want to export to the EU have to stay within the bloc's pesticide regulations while also trying to control FCM populations. It can be a tricky balancing act.",
      "\u201cThe EU has a strict zero tolerance on caterpillars and on several chemicals that, given the current weather conditions, we must use. Otherwise, we cannot meet our production targets,\u201d says Anantha Kumar, marketing manager at Isinya Roses. The company is a major local employer, with a workforce of up to 1,000 people, depending on seasonal demand.",
      "As a result, the company is now eyeing other markets with less stringent regulations. \u201cThe Middle East market is ready to accept our products, and it is really growing,\u201d Kumar says.",
      "In spite of the challenges, the growers at Isinya Roses are not ready to abandon the European market just yet. They are trying natural pest control methods, including releasing beneficial insects, companion planting, using pheromone traps, and applying natural fertilizers and composting instead of chemical fertilizers.",
      "But this year, flower farmers will likely face a challenging Valentine\u2019s Day and Mother\u2019s Day, which are usually peak sales periods for cut flowers around the world.",

      "Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, will have to serve at least 18 years in prison before he can be considered for release, a Fiji High Court registry official in Lautoka said.",
      "Dawson was convicted in December of murdering his wife, Christe Chen, who was then 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in the South Pacific nation. He then fled by kayak to a nearby island.",
      "He was sentenced by Justice Riyaz Hamza on Wednesday.",
      "Hamza told Dawson he had shown disregard for Chen\u2019s right to life and her personal liberty.",
      "\u201cYour conduct after the incident was appalling. Having inflicted serious and life-threatening injuries to the deceased you fled the scene of the crime, leaving the deceased alone and helpless,\u201d Hamza said, according to The Fiji Times newspaper.",
      "Chen's body was discovered in the couple\u2019s room by resort staff with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head after the couple was heard arguing and did not appear at breakfast or lunch the next day.",
      "Dawson pleaded not guilty to the charge and was tried over eight days.",
      "His lawyer Anil Prasad told the court that prosecutors had failed provide sufficient evidence to convict Dawson, the Fijian Broadcasting Corp. reported.",
      "Prasad said that while the prosecution alleged that Dawson was planning to flee Fiji, authorities failed to acknowledge that many of the couple\u2019s personal belongings remained at the resort.",
      "Prasad also said Dawson had no injuries to suggest he had been involved in a physical altercation with his wife.",
      "But the judge said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dawson and no one else had committed the crime.",
      "Under Fijian law, prisoners can apply for parole after serving a minimum term set by a court, although the parole board is currently unstaffed. Critics argue the lack of an effective parole option is a cause of prison overcrowding.",
      "David Naylor, an Australian National University expert on Pacific law and regulation who has lectured in Fiji, said that after serving 18 years in prison, Dawson could apply to the national Mercy Commission to be released with a pardon from the Fijian president.",
      "He could also apply for his life sentence to be reduced to a fixed term, which would set a release date, Naylor said.",
      "Dawson worked in the information technology department at Youth Villages, a nonprofit child welfare and support organization based in Memphis. An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.",
      "The Turtle Island resort, where the pair stayed, is an exclusive and remote 500-acre island that accommodates only 14 couples at a time. Yasawa is a group of about 20 volcanic islands in the west of Fiji, a nation of 930,000 people."

      "Reductions in pensions and cuts for public service personnel were central themes as the country's three main unions joined hands to confront the new government of Prime Minister Bart De Wever, whose program to take on massive government debt includes measures that weigh heavy on the lower-income working classes.",

      "Beyond the protests, Brussels international airport was closed down for departures and buses and trams were largely left idle.",
      "The themes reverberate all around Europe where a sluggish economy is driving governments to cut into social privileges that were long held sacrosanct.

    "summary": "Swiss aviation pioneer Bertrand Piccard is developing a plane powered by liquid hydrogen after a much-hyped flight in 2015 that used sunlight to travel around the world",
    "story": [
      "Swiss aviation pioneer Bertrand Piccard is developing a plane powered by liquid hydrogen after a much-hyped flight in 2015 that used sunlight to travel around the world",
      "LES SABLES D'OLONNE, France -- When aviation pioneer Bertrand Piccard a decade ago spearheaded a much-hyped flight around the world in a plane powered by sunlight, it raised awareness about climate change but held little promise of revolutionizing air travel.",
      "Now, the 66-year-old Swiss adventurer behind Solar Impulse is aiming higher, in hopes of heading toward greener commercial flight, this time using super-cooled liquid hydrogen.",
      "From a workshop on France's Atlantic coast, Piccard and his partners are ramping up Climate Impulse, a project started last February to fly a two-seater plane around the globe nonstop over nine days fueled by what's known as green hydrogen. That's hydrogen split out of water molecules using renewable electricity through a process called electrolysis.",
      "The Climate Impulse team, whose backers include Airbus and a science incubator called Syensqo (pronounced \u201cscience-co\u201d) born from Belgian pharmaceuticals company Solvay, presented its first-year progress to reporters Thursday in Les Sables d\u2019Olonne, an oceanside town better known as host to the Vendee Globe round-the-world sailing race.",
      "First test flights are planned next year, but the grueling round-the-world trip is set for 2028. Made with lightweight composites, the plane is dependent on several untested innovations and is far from a sure bet.",
      "Piccard says a major airplane manufacturer wouldn't take on the risk of producing a prototype such as Climate Impulse in case it fails.",
      "\u201dIt\u2019s my job to be a pioneer,\" he said in an interview. \u201cWe have to show it\u2019s possible, then it\u2019s a big incentive for the others to continue.\u201d",
      "Even if the project is successful, experts say green hydrogen-powered flight on a commercial scale would be decades away at best. The project has lured tens of millions of euros (dollars) of investment, and the team of dozens of staffers is growing.",
      "The solar-powered plane a decade ago was a technological feat, but wasn't scalable, said Raphael Dinelli, the Climate Impulse engineer and co-pilot.",
      "To accommodate 100 passengers, a souped-up Solar Impulse version would need solar-paneled wings with a span up to 300 meters, he said. Limited in range, the plane flown in 2015 also made 14 stops during its globe-circling trip.",
      "The goal for Climate Impulse is to take off unassisted, fly some 40,000 kilometers (about 25,000 miles) around Earth along the Equator at a gentle speed of about 200 kilometers per hour (125 mph), and return to its starting point with no mid-air refueling \u2014 and with no stops at all.",
      "The controlled release of liquid hydrogen from ultra-insulated tanks under the airplane's wings causes it to heat into a gas, a bit like how pressurized water vapor powered 19th-century steam engines. But instead of a mechanical operation in a steam engine, energy from the hydrogen evaporation seeps into the membrane of a fuel cell that powers the plane.",
      "Because it's hydrogen, the only emissions will be water vapor. Still, outside experts caution that the environmental impact of such water-vapor \u201ccontrails\u201d remains unknown in a real-world or large-scale scenario.",
      "Many minds have been looking at alternatives to carbon-based fuels to clean up air travel, which the International Energy Agency says is responsible for about 2% of global emissions of heat-trapping carbon dioxide.",
      "Hydrogen has been used in flights for decades but as a gas, not a liquid. Use of liquid hydrogen will take time to scale up. Fossil fuels, which are cheaper and more efficient, still produce most hydrogen today.",
      "Many governments want to produce more green hydrogen, but for now, the world can\u2019t make enough clean electricity for power needs on land, let alone to generate enough for wide-scale use by planes in the air.",
      "In the last year, the team has built the cockpit shell, started building the wing spar, and finalized interior components. They include swivel seats, a bunk and a stationary bicycle-like workout system to promote blood circulation for the two co-pilots who will be cramped in a small plane in low-oxygen conditions over nine days.",
      "The hardest parts await.",
      "Tests are planned this year on the fuel cells and propulsion systems, to see if the electric motor, propeller and batteries could work for an initial fully-electric flight phase.",

      "Another challenge: the liquid hydrogen must be maintained at minus 253 degrees Celsius (minus 423 Fahrenheit), or nearly absolute zero. Construction of a leak-proof tank is essential. Liquid hydrogen is highly flammable, so any seepage could have devastating results.",

      "The weight of batteries, important for electric vehicles on the ground, is even more important in aviation.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. retail sales dropped sharply last month, in part because cold weather kept more Americans indoors, denting sales at car dealers and most other stores.",
      "Retail sales dropped 0.9% in January from the previous month, the Commerce Department said, after two months of healthy gains. It was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest decline since last January.",
      "The average temperature in January was the lowest since 1988, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, and was particularly disruptive in the South. Devastating fires in Los Angeles may have also impacted spending.",
      "Sales plummeted 2.8% last month at auto dealers and slumped at furniture stores, home and garden centers, Even in the usually strong online retail sector saw a 1.9% decline. Sales rose at general merchandise stores, a category that includes big retailers like Walmart and Target, and at restaurants and bars.",
      "In addition to cold weather, the decline could reflect falling consumer confidence as reflected in recent surveys by the Conference Board and University of Michigan. Still, hiring and wage growth have been steady, suggesting the economy is still expanding. Last week the government reported that the unemployment rate fell for the second straight month to a low 4%.",
      "Yet inflation also ticked higher last month, underscoring its persistence despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool prices through higher interest rates. The cost of groceries jumped in January from the previous month, pushed higher by soaring egg prices. Rising costs could be exacting a toll on shoppers.",
      "President Donald Trump is also stepping up tariff threats, which could raise prices further. Trump said Thursday he would soon impose \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on countries that levy large duties on U.S. goods exports. Trump has already added 10% import taxes on goods from China, and has said he will place 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",

      "NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk during his visit to the U.S. to meet President Donald Trump. The exact nature of the meeting is unclear, although Modi said on X that the two men \u201cdiscussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology and innovation.\u201d",

      "Musk, who previously called himself a \u201cfan of Modi,\" has long wanted his Starlink satellite internet service to make an entry into the Indian market.

      "Last November, India\u2019s telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink was yet to comply with security norms, and a license for satellite communications services will be issued only after the company meets all the requirements.",
      "Musk had earlier criticized India's policy of granting spectrum for satellite services through auctioning. The Indian government later changed the policy and said it will assign satellite spectrum and not auction it.",
      "India\u2019s satellite broadband service market is highly competitive. At least six companies control the market, led by Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio.",

      "Musk\u2019s Starlink has at least 6,900 active satellites orbiting Earth that provide low-latency broadband to some 4.6 million people. But if Musk wants to enter the Indian market, Starlink's high pricing could be a concern.",
      "Mobile data in India is among the cheapest globally, and Ambani's Jio once gave data for free on its mobile plans. And yet, at least 40% of the country\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people still don\u2019t have access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous areas.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 07:54:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Record high egg prices prompted Nevada lawmakers to unanimously back suspending their cage-free egg law, but the six other states with similar laws in effect have shown no sign of dropping them even if it might help lower grocery bills",
    "story": [
      "Record high egg prices prompted Nevada lawmakers to unanimously back suspending their cage-free egg law, but the six other states with similar laws in effect have shown no sign of dropping them even if it might help lower grocery bills",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Back when egg prices remained securely under $2 a dozen in 2021, Nevada joined several other states concerned about animal welfare in requiring cage-free eggs.",
      "Now four years later, a dozen eggs costs an average of nearly $5 in the U.S. because of the lingering bird flu, so Nevada passed a law the governor signed Thursday that will allow the state to suspend that law temporarily in hopes of getting residents some relief at the checkout counter.",
      "But it is not quite that simple, which is why the other six states with the same laws are so far reticent to follow suit.",
      "By relaxing the rule, Nevada might get access to additional eggs, but the supply of all eggs remains tight because nearly 159 million birds have been slaughtered since the bird flu outbreak began in 2022 to help limit virus spread. The virus prompts the slaughter of entire flocks anytime it is found.",
      "It is not clear dropping cage-free laws will have a significant effect on egg prices that have peaked at an average of $4.95 per dozen because the farmers who collectively invested several billion dollars in making the switch can\u2019t easily go back to raising chickens packed together in massive barns that they already spent the money to convert.",
      "Even if all the cage-free laws went away, big corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Sodexo remain committed to buying only those kind of eggs, ensuring strong demand for cage-free eggs.",
      "University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said opening up Nevada to all kinds of eggs \u201ccould ease egg prices in Nevada very slightly,\u201d but that it might make prices worse elsewhere because supplies are so tight.",
      "But Nevada is going to give it a try even if California, Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan don't seem to be considering it. Arizona, Rhode Island and Utah also have cage-free laws on the books, but theirs won't take effect for at least a couple more years.",
      "Democratic Assemblymember Howard Watts III, who raises chickens in his Nevada backyard, advocated for the 2021 bill to promote the \u201cstandard of humane treatment\u201d of the animals. But the ongoing bird flu outbreak in the U.S. has caused egg prices to to hit a record high, and cage-free eggs are generally even more expensive.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that was not foreseen at that time was this major animal disease outbreak,\u201d Watts testified Tuesday. \u201cAs a result, there was no regulatory flexibility to suspend those requirements in the event of a major supply chain disruption.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo approved the legislation Thursday. Nevada Department of Agriculture Director J.J. Goicoechea is expected to authorize the 120-day suspension of the cage-free egg requirements within a day, according to Goicoechea's spokesperson Ciara Ressel.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate 30 days before we can see an impact at the grocery stores,\u201d Ressel said.",
      "This month\u2019s jump in egg prices was the biggest since the nation\u2019s last bird flu outbreak in 2015. The previous high was set two years ago when eggs were selling for $4.82 per dozen on average.",
      "The average prices mask just how bad it is in some places. Some Californians these days are shelling out $12.99 for a dozen, or more than a buck an egg. Some New York shops even started selling bundles of three eggs to help people who can't afford a full dozen.",
      "Nevada resident Nancy Wong said she has been \u201coutraged\u201d by egg prices in the state. \u201cWe have gone to the store and eggs have been either rationed or completely out,\u201d she said.",
      "The concern with the cage-free requirements is that only about 121 million of the 304 million chickens laying eggs nationwide are raised on cage-free farms, so the supply is limited.",
      "Many of the eggs those hens produce are promised to restaurant chains like McDonald's and Panera, food service giants like Sodexo and Aramark and grocers under long-term contracts that help keep prices down. But even when they do have to pay a premium, grocers sometimes lose money on eggs by selling them cheaply to try to get shoppers in the door.",
      "The number of cage-free chickens has steadily increased in recent years because of the laws and the pressure from the companies buying eggs, increasing exponentially from just 38 million at the start of 2017. But the United Egg Producers trade group has estimated it would take at least 226 million cage-free hens to meet all the demand for those eggs, and more customers are clamoring for them, so the supply is tight.",
      "The total flock of chickens nationwide used to number above 330 million before the bird flu outbreak began.",
      "Even as more egg farmers were converting to cage-free setups over the past decade, prices stayed between $1.40 and $2 per dozen most of the time with only the normal seasonal price spikes around Easter and Thanksgiving until this current bird flu outbreak began in early 2022.",
      "If bird flu outbreaks happen to hit cage-free farms hard, there are fewer eggs out there that can replace the lost ones. For example, out of the nearly 47 million birds slaughtered just since the start of December, more than 3 million of them were on five cage-free farms in California.",
      "Anytime birds must be killed, it takes months for a farm to resume producing eggs because of the time required to dispose of the carcasses, sanitize the barns and raise new chickens until they are about 5 months old and capable of laying eggs.",
      "California won\u2019t consider dropping its cage-free law in part because the rule came from a measure voters passed in 2018, so voters would have to approve any major changes.",
      "But there doesn't seem to be much support for changes in other states either.",
      "Michigan state Rep. Jerry Neyer, a dairy farmer and chair of the state House Agriculture Committee, said the idea that new cage-free laws are driving up egg prices is a \u201cmisconception.\u201d The Republican added that most farms already adapted to comply with the law, so dropping the mandate wouldn't cut costs.",
      "A bill to repeal Colorado\u2019s cage-free requirements, which just took effect on Jan. 1, was killed in its first committee vote last month. The sponsor, Republican state Rep. Ryan Gonzalez, argued that while the avian flu was a major factor in prices, the cage-free rules played a significant role. But the majority of lawmakers on the panel appeared skeptical.",
      "Jonathan Kuester, who runs the small Historic Wagner Farm with about 200 Red Star hens in Illinois just outside Chicago, said he doesn't think cage-free practices are the cause of the egg shortages.",
      "He acknowledged his farm is more vulnerable to a bird flu infection than a traditional farm where chickens are confined inside a barn that can be better protected. Kuester's birds roam free, where they might interact with ducks and geese that are the main carriers of the disease.",
      "\u201cThe egg shortage that people are seeing is a result of some fairly large flocks being euthanized, and so fewer chickens are currently laying than were three or four months ago,\" Kuester said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of a panic, too. People are suddenly buying eggs as quickly as they can, and so you see that shortage.\"",

Her current unit costs about $490 per month and lacks even a bathroom sink, forcing her to collect water from the showerhead with a basin to wash her face. Her home will need renovation to meet proposed requirements for fire safety and separate electricity and water meters.",
      "Ching worries that upgraded homes will be too expensive for her.",
      "The government has said if necessary, it will offer assistance such as helping affected tenants to find other private accommodation or directly providing temporary shelter. A top official told the city\u2019s public broadcaster that transitional housing apartments are ready and assured that large-scale enforcement will happen only when proper resettlement arrangements are available.",
      "Chan Siu-ming, a professor at the City University of Hong Kong\u2019s social and behavioral sciences department, welcomed the government\u2019s taking steps to set minimum standards, but said its resettlement plans are inadequate.",
      "Chan said the impact could be wider than officials expect, and the city\u2019s supply of public and transitional housing may not meet needs. Low-income residents may also need help shouldering the cost of moving house, he said.",
      "As of last September, the average waiting time for a public flat is five and a half years, but it can take even longer than that. Ching said she's waited for eight years.",
      "In an emailed response to questions from The Associated Press, the government said it does not expect significant surges in rent as demand will drop with the increasing public housing supply. It reiterated that the rules will be implemented gradually to avoid causing panic.",
      "Chan added that some single people may be forced into even smaller dormitory-like \u201cbed spaces,\u201d which are not covered by the proposed rules. Bed spaces are widely considered to be Hong Kong's worst form of housing \u2014 partitioned areas in which residents get barely enough space to fit a single bed and some belongings. They are currently regulated under another law, the government said.",
      "Sze Lai-shan, the deputy director of the Society for Community Organization, a non-government organization, said some people have already been asked to move out of subdivided homes as landlords anticipate the policy.",
      "She suggested the government start registering substandard flats before the legislation comes into force to assess the residents\u2019 needs and consider expanding the eligibility for transitional housing. She also hoped the policy would eventually cover those living in tiny bed spaces.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to explain to people that Hong Kong has two sets of housing standards,\u201d she said.",
      "In Sham Shui Po, one of the city\u2019s poorest districts, bed space resident Law Chung Yu said he doubts that landlords will be able to comply with the rules.",
      "Law, who can\u2019t work due to a health problem and rents one layer of a bunk bed, pays around $280 in monthly rent for the bed space, about 30% of what he gets from the government subsidies he lives on. He shares a bathroom with neighbors in an apartment infested by lice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically an armchair strategy, I don\u2019t see it having much impact in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Au's never measured her unit, and isn\u2019t sure if her unit meets the minimum size. But with her neighboring units falling short of the minimum size requirement, she knows her home would probably be gone too. She hopes the government will help resettle affected households into places that cost the same as their current rent.",
      "Her landlord hasn\u2019t discussed the issue with her yet. For now, all she can do is wait.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m taking it day by day. It\u2019d be worse if I think about it so much I develop mental problems,\u201d she said."

      "The State Department had been in talks with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla company to buy armored electric vehicles, but the plans have been put on hold by the Trump administration after reports emerged about a potential $400 million purchase",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The State Department had been in talks with Elon Musk's Tesla company to buy armored electric vehicles, but the plans have been put on hold by the Trump administration after reports emerged about a potential $400 million purchase.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said the electric car company owned by Musk, who has become President Donald Trump's billionaire adviser aiming to dismantle agencies and downsize the federal workforce, was the only one that expressed interest back in May 2024, when Joe Biden was president.",
      "While it was in its planning phases, the deal with Tesla was forecast to be the largest contract of the year. It shows how some of his wealth has come and was still expected to come from taxpayers before the plans were put on hold. His companies obtain hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. And Tesla had already received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "No government contract had been given to Tesla or any other manufacturer to produce armored electric vehicles for the Department of State, the agency said.",
      "The Biden administration had tasked the State Department to gather information from potential suppliers to buy these vehicles in September. An official request for bids was to be released in May, according to State Department data from December. But that solicitation is now on hold with no plans to issue it, the State Department said.",
      "After reports emerged about the plans to buy from Tesla, the State Department changed the data entry on its expected contracts forecast for fiscal year 2025 late Wednesday. The State Department said it should have been entered into the system as a generic \u201celectric vehicle manufacturer,\" but there is at least another entry for a different purchase that continues to list a company\u2014 German car manufacturer BMW."

      "In a major reversal, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency says he'll try to rescind $20 billion in grants awarded by the Biden administration for climate and clean-energy projects",
      "WASHINGTON -- In a major reversal, the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency said he will try to rescind $20 billion in grants awarded by the Biden administration for climate and clean-energy projects.",
      "In a video posted on X, Administrator Lee Zeldin said the EPA would revoke contracts for a still-emerging \u201cgreen bank\u201d that is set to fund tens of thousands of projects to fight climate change and promote environmental justice.",
      "The program, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, but is more commonly called the green bank. Two initiatives, worth $14 billion and $6 billion respectively, are intended to offer competitive grants to nonprofits, community development banks and other groups for projects with a focus on disadvantaged communities.",
      "The program is a favorite of Democrats who passed President Joe Biden's signature climate law without a single Republican vote, and former EPA Administrator Michael Regan frequently cited it as one of his major accomplishments.",
      "Republicans in Congress have called the green bank a \u201cslush fund\u201d and voiced concern over how the money will be used and whether there will be sufficient accountability and transparency. The Republican-controlled House approved a bill last year to repeal the green bank and other parts of Biden\u2019s climate agenda. The bill was blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.",
      "Zeldin, in the video posted Wednesday night, said there will be \u201czero tolerance of any waste and abuse\u201d at the EPA under his administration. He cited \u201can extremely disturbing video\u201d on X that features a former EPA staffer stating that the Biden administration was \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d in order to spend billions of taxpayer dollars before President Donald Trump took office.",
      "\u201cThe days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cI\u2019ve directed my team to find your gold bars, and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.\"",
      "The video Zeldin cited was posted by Project Veritas, a right-wing organization that often uses hidden cameras to try to embarrass news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic officials. In this case, the Veritas video showed Brent Efron, a former EPA special adviser for implementation, speaking at a bar or restaurant with someone who turned out to be with the group. Efron has since left the EPA.",
      "Clean energy advocates denounced Zeldin's action as a political stunt and said he was illegally attempting to revoke spending approved by Congress for partisan reasons. They pledged to challenge the directive in court.",
      "\u201cThis is not just an attack on clean energy investments \u2014 it\u2019s a blatant violation of the Constitution,\" said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group that supports the green bank. \u201cThe Trump team is once again trying to illegally slash programs meant to help American families to fund tax cuts for billionaires.\u201d",
      "The money has already been awarded to eight nonprofits, including the Coalition for Green Capital, Climate United Fund, Power Forward Communities, Opportunity Finance Network, Inclusiv and the Justice Climate Fund. Those organizations have partnered with a range of groups, including Rewiring America, Habitat for Humanity and the Community Preservation Corporation.",
      "Former Vice President Kamala Harris announced the grant awards last year at an event in Charlotte, North Carolina."

      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including how the bond market reacts to the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage briefly fell to a 2-year low last September, but has been mostly hovering around 7% this year. That\u2019s more than double the 2.65% record low the average rate hit a little over four years ago.",
      "Rising home prices and elevated mortgage rates, which can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers, have kept many prospective home shoppers on the sidelines, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years, extending a national home sales slump that began in 2022 as mortgage rates began to climb from their pandemic-era lows.",

Eggs Up Grill has 90 restaurants in nine southern states, up from 26 in 2018. Florida-based Another Broken Egg Caf\u00e9 celebrated its 100th restaurant last year.",

But an ongoing bird flu outbreak, which so far has forced farms to slaughter more than 145 million chickens, turkeys and other birds, is making supplies scarcer and pushing up prices. In January, the average price of eggs in the U.S. hit a record $4.95 per dozen.",

U.S. Foods, a restaurant supplier, and Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. producer of shell eggs, did not respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",

      "To address animal rights concerns, McDonald\u2019s and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments.",
      "\u201cIt makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,\u201d Earnest said.",
      "The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door.",

Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association.",

      "Then the improvement on inflation stopped. Year-over-year consumer price inflation has now risen for four straight months.",
      "And economists and financial markets are worried that President Donald Trump's policies will push inflation higher yet. His tariffs on foreign goods and plans to deport millions of undocumented workers could translate into higher prices.",
      "In response to stubborn inflation, the Fed may hold off on further rate cuts. Back in December, it signaled that it expected to cut two more times in 2025. That seems far less likely now. Wall Street investors anticipate only rate cut this year and don't expect that one until October.",

      "Thailand's army says some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar",
      "BANGKOK -- Some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar, Thailand's army announced Thursday.",
      "In a fresh crackdown on scam centers operating from Southeast Asia, the Thai army announced Thursday it is coordinating an effort to repatriate some 260 people believed to have been victims of human trafficking after they were rescued and sent from Myanmar to Thailand.",
      "Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have become known as havens for criminal syndicates who are estimated to have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have extracted tens of billions of dollars from victims around the world, according to U.N. experts, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023 after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state along its border. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.",
      "The army said that those rescued in the most recent operation came from 20 nationalities \u2014 with significant numbers from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan and China. There were also nationals of Indonesia, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, Laos, Brazil, Burundi, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana and India. They were sent across the border from Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy district to Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Wednesday.",
      "Reports in Thai media said a Myanmar ethnic militia that controls the area where they were held, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, was responsible for freeing the workers and taking them to the border. Myanmar\u2019s military government exercises little control over frontier areas where ethnic minorities predominate.",
      "Several ethnic militias are believed to be involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking and protecting call-center scam operations.",
      "The Thai army statement said the rescued people will undergo questioning, and if determined to be victims of human trafficking, will enter a process of protection while waiting to be sent back to their countries.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who is also defense minister, said Wednesday that there might be many more scam workers waiting to be repatriated from Myanmar through Thailand, but that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their country of origin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that Thailand is not going to set up another shelter,\u201d he told reporters during a visit in Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. Thailand hosts nine refugee camps along the border holding more than 100,000 people, most from Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Karen minority.",
      "Phumtham added that Thailand would also need to question them before sending them back, first is to make sure that they are victims of human trafficking, and also to get information that would help the police investigate the trafficking and scam problems.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks that plague Southeast Asia.",
      "Many dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Bangkok only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar have surfaced. Chinese actor Wang Xing was a high-profile case but was quickly rescued after his tale spread on social media.",
      "Underlining Beijing\u2019s concern, Liu Zhongyi, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Public Security and Commissioner of its Criminal Investigation Bureau, made an official visit to Thailand last month and inspected the border area opposite where many of the Myanmar\u2019s scam centers are located.",
      "Just ahead of Paetongtarn\u2019s visit to China, the Thai government issued an order to cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border with northern Thailand, citing national security and severe damage that the country has suffered from scam operations.",
      "Her government is considering expanding this measure to Thailand\u2019s northeastern areas bordering Cambodia, said Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Thanathip Sawangsang, who explained that officials had already removed internet cables that were installed illegally in the areas."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he\u2019ll sign an order that increases U.S. tariffs to the rates other countries charge on imports",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Thursday that he\u2019ll sign an order that increases U.S. tariffs to the rates other countries charge on imports.",
      "\u201cTODAY IS THE BIG ONE: RECIPROCAL TARIFFS!!!\u201d Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\u201d",
      "The prospect of a dramatic hike on tariffs could send shockwaves through the world economy, possibly depressing growth while also causing inflation to intensify. Trump has maintained that such tariffs will help to create domestic factory jobs, but most economists say they would effectively be a tax increase on U.S. consumers that would add to inflationary pressures.",
      "The Republican president has openly antagonized multiple U.S. trading partners over the past several weeks, levying tariff threats and inviting them to retaliate with import taxes of their own that could send the economy hurtling into a trade war.",
      "Trump has put an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports due that country's role in the production of the opioid fentanyl. He also has readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. On top of that, on Monday, he removed the exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs. And he's mused about new tariffs on computer chips and pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "The European Union, Canada and Mexico have countermeasures ready to inflict economic pain on the United States in response to Trump's actions, while China has already taken retaliatory steps with its own tariffs on U.S. energy, agricultural machinery and large-engine autos as well as an antitrust investigation of Google.",
      "Trump has not specified how he defines the term \u201creciprocal\u201d and whether his order would apply only to matching tariffs or to including other foreign taxes that he views as a barrier to exporting American goods.",
      "The White House has argued that charging the same import taxes as other countries do would improve the fairness of trade, potentially raising revenues for the U.S. government while also enabling negotiations that could eventually improve trade.",
      "But Trump is also making a political wager that voters can tolerate higher inflation levels. Price spikes in 2021 and 2022 severely weakened the popularity of then-President Joe Biden, with voters so frustrated by inflation eroding their buying power that they chose last year to put Trump back in the White House to address the problem. Inflation has risen since November's election, with the government reporting on Wednesday that the consumer price index is running at an annual rate of 3%.",
      "The Trump team has decried criticism of its tariffs even as it has acknowledged the likelihood of some financial pain. It says that the tariffs have to be weighed against the possible extension and expansion of Trump's 2017 tax cuts as well as efforts to curb regulations and force savings through the spending freezes and staff reductions in billionaire adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency initiative.",
      "But an obstacle for this approach might be the sequencing of the various policies and the possibilities of a wider trade conflict stifling investment and hiring amid the greater inflationary pressures.",
      "Analysts at the bank Wells Fargo said in a Thursday report that the tariffs would likely hurt growth this year, just as the extended tax cuts could help growth recover in 2026.",
      "\u201cTariffs impart a modest stagflationary shock to an economy,\" the report said. \u201cThe U.S. economy entered 2025 with a fair amount of momentum, but we look for real GDP growth to downshift a bit over the next few quarters as the price-boosting effects of tariffs erode growth in real income, thereby weighing on growth in real consumer spending.\u201d"

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The future of Indonesia\u2019s automobiles and motorbikes is electric \u2014 at least according to exhibitors at the Indonesia International Motor Show, which opened in the country's capital city of Jakarta on Thursday.",
      "That's despite the country's own slow uptake of electric vehicles and motorbikes, which only make up a small fraction of the vehicles in the world's fourth most populated country.",
      "Over 50 international and domestic brands were on display at the massive exhibition hall, with several brands staging Indonesian debuts for hybrid or electric vehicles. Chinese automaker BYD unveiled its Sealion 7 electric SUV, while Vietnamese automaker VinFast's electric-powered VF 3 mini SUV had its Indonesia debut.",
      "The event also welcomed a new automaker to Indonesia, with China's Honri bringing its five-passenger Boma EV.",
      "While the show floor was dominated by Asian companies, other international makers were present as well, including Germany's Volkswagen and BMW's Mini.",
      "Motorbikes \u2014 of which Indonesia has one of the largest fleets in the world, with over 132 million registered in 2023 \u2014 were also a mainstay of event, with foreign-made Royal Enfields and Vespas on display alongside Indonesia-made Alvas.",
      "A much smaller part of the show featured fossil fuel-powered jet skis and boats, which can be seen on the vast coastlines, rivers and lakes of the country's over 17,000 islands.",
      "Outside the exhibition hall, drivers enjoyed new-car smell as they test drove cars across parking lots and over steep ramps. Eager leasing agents and sales representatives awaited drivers as they stepped out from behind the wheel.",
      "The show opened as the country faced a slowdown in it's automative industry last year: In 2024 sales fell by nearly 14% \u2014 from 1 million units in 2023 to 866,000 in 2024 according to the Indonesian Automotive Manufacturers Association. Indonesia\u2019s number of registered vehicles was reported at 24,646,825 units in 2023, according to the association.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s Minister of Industry, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, said the event is expected to be one of the main drivers in the recovery of the country\u2019s slowing automotive sector.",
      "\u201cIn a declining market condition, all stakeholders, including the government, need to find strategic steps to increase public interest in shopping for motor vehicles,\u201d he said during the event\u2019s opening.",
      "While sales of electric vehicles and motorbikes are rising, they're still just 7% of the country\u2019s fleet, according to consulting firm PwC.",
      "A lack of infrastructure, high upfront cost and low performance hinder the adoption of EVs in Indonesia, according to a 2023 report by Indonesia-based nongovernmental organization Institute for Essential Services Reform.",
      "Some EV makers said they recognize these barriers and are working to tackle them.",
      "VinFast is partnering with V-Green, a spin-off from VinFast's charging station development division, to build 30,000 chargers across Indonesia, said VinFast Asia CEO Pham Sanh Chau.",
      "\u201cWithout (chargers), we cannot sell the car,\" he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we come in with the whole ecosystem.\"",
      "VinFast and other electric vehicle makers such as BYD are also building EV manufacturing plants in Indonesia. South Korea\u2019s Hyundai and China\u2019s Wuling have both had EV plants in the country since 2022.",
      "The Indonesia government has sought partnerships with makers as it is eager to turn the country into an international hub for EVs, leveraging its abundant reserves of critical materials needed to make batteries.",
      "The small percentage of sales matches the slow progress of Indonesia\u2019s energy transition: Despite receiving billions of dollars in funding to retire coal and transition to greener energy, the country's renewable energy mix was \u200b\u200bjust 14% in 2024, with a majority of energy coming from highly-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.",

      "Since President Donald Trump began his second term last month, he has focused on bringing about a dramatic reduction in the federal workforce at a breakneck pace",
      "Since President Donald Trump began his second term last month, he has focused on dramatically reducing the federal workforce at a breakneck pace.",
      "From dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development to offering a mass deferred resignation plan, Trump's Republican administration has released executive orders and memos aimed at substantially reshaping the size of government and where its employees work.",
      "Here's what to know about the federal workforce, its job protections and the process of cutting back on its ranks.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, comprises about 2.4 million people.",
      "While a chunk of federal workers, about 20%, are in Washington, D.C., and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% are distributed outside the region.",
      "Civil servants are the vast majority of federal workers. They're generally hired through an application process and have strong protections once in their positions.",
      "Political appointees, who number roughly 4,000, serve at the discretion of the president and can be dismissed at will by the chief executive.",
      "\u201cCivil servants tend to be in their jobs as careers, some of them for decades,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked in President Bill Clinton\u2019s Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government.",
      "It\u2019s not easy to fire the vast majority of federal workers \u2014 they have considerable job security with a long legal history.",
      "Federal employees who are not political appointees have strong protections designed to prevent political whims from clearing out the workforce. The protections have grown over time, under leadership of both major political parties.",
      "\u201cThe president definitely has his work cut out for him,\u201d said Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.",
      "Federal workers are entitled to due process, which means they can challenge disciplinary actions through a formal process. They have to be notified of the allegations against them and allowed to respond and present their side.",
      "\u201cYou have to build a record to fire somebody, and that doesn't often happen,\u201d Kamarck said.",
      "Federal employee protections started as a reform to the chaos caused by the 19th-century spoils system, in which federal jobs were awarded to a president's loyalists. It led to incompetence and corruption as well as massive turnover with new administrations that proved disruptive and prevented continuity of expertise.",
      "In 1881, President James Garfield was shot and killed by a man who believed Garfield owed him a job after campaigning for him. That led to the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883, which created a merit-based system for hiring federal employees.",
      "In 1978, Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act, to shield the merit system with enforceable rights so that most federal workers can be fired only for a legitimate reason.",
      "\u201cThe idea is that we\u2019re not going to get the best people if their jobs are completely insecure and if they\u2019re going to lose their job every time a new party takes power, so to encourage quality people to apply for government service, we provide some security,\u201d said David Super, a professor who specializes in administrative law at Georgetown Law.",
      "No other U.S. leader has attempted sweeping and dramatic cuts like those Trump wants, said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization focused on improving government.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in our history that has ever approximated what we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d Stier said.",
      "Federal workers have union representation, but, unlike those of many industries, they do not have the power to strike. Federal workers also can't bargain over pay, because salaries are set in law.",
      "Federal unions can bargain over working conditions and basic protections for their members. Recently, unions have battled over remote working conditions, which they've successfully bargained for in the past and Trump is working to sharply reduce.",
      "\u201cThere also are some limits about what they can bargain over, so, for example, they can\u2019t bargain over what the policy of their agency is,\" Super said. \"That\u2019s a matter for the political process to work out, but they can bargain for things that affect workers on their jobs and their well-being.\u201d",
      "Federal employees have varying probationary periods, often a year or two, when they carry out tasks under a supervisor, who evaluates whether the worker is doing the job successfully. If not, workers can be dismissed; if so, they are brought on as full-time employees with protections.",
      "Employees on probation don\u2019t have the same appeal rights \u2014 it\u2019s an easier process to dismiss them.",

      "English cricket has generated more than 520 million pounds ($650 million) from the sale of stakes in franchises in its recently created competition The Hundred to big-business investors from India and the United States",
      "English cricket has generated around $650 million from the sale of stakes in franchises in The Hundred to big-business investors from India and the United States, including consortiums involving NFL great Tom Brady and Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly.",
      "Auctions held over the past two weeks drew bids that value the eight teams in The Hundred \u2014 a format similar to Twenty20 and launched in England only in 2021 \u2014 at more than $1.2 billion.",
      "English cricket officials confirmed the huge figures for the first time on Thursday and set out how they want the money spent. The priority? Safeguarding the future of the domestic game that has lurched into financial strife in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a seminal moment for cricket in England and Wales,\u201d said Richard Thompson, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board.",
      "The investors who secured stakes in the franchises range from Silicon Valley tech giants including Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, to four Indian conglomerates already owning teams in the widely popular Indian Premier League.",
      "Throw in the likes of Knighthead Capital Management, which includes Brady and already owns Birmingham City soccer club, and Cain International, a company co-funded by Boehly, and there's now a heavy dose of expertise in finance, technology and elite sport in a once-quaint sport that has been supercharged by money from around the world.",
      "It was 17 years ago when Allen Stanford, a Texan businessman, flew into Lord's \u2014 the so-called \u201chome of cricket\u201d in northwest London \u2014 aboard a private helicopter filled with fake dollar notes in a publicity stunt for a remarkable deal he reached with the ECB: A five-match T20 series between England and superstars from the Caribbean worth $100 million.",
      "The ECB were in raptures for a supposedly game-changing deal that quickly went wrong when Stanford was charged with \u2014 and later convicted of \u2014 fraud.",
      "So, has the ECB learnt its lessons after hitting the jackpot again?",
      "\u201cThis has probably been done in a different style \u2014 a bit more muted,\u201d ECB chief executive Richard Gould said on a video call. \u201cWe are very confident in the investor group we have got. ... We haven't been complacent.\u201d",
      "The ECB has done \u201cextensive due diligence\u201d and \u201call the checks to ensure it will be a different outcome\" to the Stanford debacle, director of business operations Vikram Banerjee said.",
      "The ECB seems open to that, yes.",
      "\u201cWe'd be foolish not to listen to the amazing set of investors that have got great ideas,\u201d Gould said. \u201cWe need to make sure we are a governing body that provides stability but also enables our investors and county clubs to drive forward.\u201d",
      "Gould made reference to the NFL taking games overseas and also the idea \u2014 floated around in 2008 but never adopted \u2014 of a 39th round of English Premier League games played abroad.",
      "No, the ECB insists.",
      "The governing body said it still owns The Hundred as a competition and felt it was important the \u201cstructure of the game is retained and owned by the ECB and our members (the counties).\u201d That means the schedule, the formats and the governance of English cricket.",
      "Expect, however, the new investors to make changes to their franchises when it comes to team names, colors and branding in The Hundred from 2026.",
      "Changing the times when matches are played \u2014 to potentially suit Indian audiences, for example \u2014 is \u201cnot on the agenda,\u201d Gould said, because securing strong attendances inside the stadiums is a priority.",
      "Banerjee said there was no intention to turn the Hundred \u2014 a format where each team receives a maximum of 100 balls \u2014 into a T20 competition but could envisage the competition having a second tier if there is enough growth.",
      "The ECB said the new investors have a \u201clock-in period\u201d of five years before they can sell their shares to other parties.",
      "The ECB said the deals, once finalized after an exclusivity period, will underpin \u201clong-term financial sustainability\u201d in the domestic game in England.",
      "Proceeds from the sales will be split 19 ways \u2014 between the 18 long-established county teams in the English and Welsh domestic game as well as the Marylebone Cricket Club, which owns Lord\u2019s and is regarded as the guardian of the laws of the game. The grassroots game is in line to receive around 50 million pounds ($62 million), the ECB said.",
      "\u201cOur three overarching principles as we look at what we want this investment to deliver should be strategic, ambitious and leaving a legacy,\u201d Thompson said in an open letter. \u201cWe may not get this chance again for at least a generation, and cannot afford to waste this golden opportunity.\u201d",
      "Thompson spoke of the money heading to \u201cthree core investment areas\u201d: Building reserves, revenue generation or debt reduction.",

      "Valentine's day and the whiff of chocolate and cocoa are in the air",
      "BRUGES, Belgium -- St. Valentine chocolates always seek to show how deep your love is. This year, it might just also show how deep your pockets are.",
      "With the price of cocoa beans setting unprecedented records on the commodities market, it will certainly turn the gift of love into a bigger financial commitment than it once was. Turns out that if love is reputed to be eternal, a low price for cocoa, the essential ingredient in chocolate, is not.",
      "\u201cThe price increase of cocoa is absolutely spectacular, now for 2, 2\u00bd years,\u201d said Philippe de Sellier, the head of both Leonidas and Belgian chocolate federation Choprabisco. When it stood at less than $2,000 a ton in the summer of 2022, it really took over early last year and peaked at well over $12,000 during the Christmas season and has been hovering around the $10,000 mark since.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing unprecedented prices. They haven't been this high for the last 50 years,\u201d said Bart Van Besien, policy adviser of the Oxfam fair trade group. And the impact can be felt deep in chocolate gourmet country Belgium, where some of its 280 chocolate companies are left with a bleeding heart during Valentine's week.",
      "Dominque Persoone, owner of the famed Chocolate Line brand, still has plenty of beans to grind in his workshop in Bruges, but considers himself lucky, partly because he also has his own cocoa plantation in Mexico.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of colleagues who are really in trouble, because the price is too high,\" he said. \u201cIf you don't have good contacts, they just don't deliver anymore.\u201d",
      "Some just close for Valentine, he said, turning one of the few financial bonanzas of the year into a forced vacation, hoping that Easter, with its eggs and bunnies, will bring better tidings. Many chocolatiers can't go for the usual profit margins and turn all the extra costs of the cocoa prices over to their customers. Persoone said that his chocolates increased in price by 20% over the last year alone while de Selliers said that it depends very much from producer to producer.",
      "The shock of cocoa prices pretty much is a metaphorical perfect storm, mixing climate, disease, commodity speculation, the plight of farmers and social ascendency around the world into one heady mix.",
      "\u201cThe drop that has happened now in production was directly linked to climate change,\u201d said Van Besien, blaming changes in annual rain and drought patterns in western Africa that weakened the sensitive trees in key production areas. Persoone also said that the temperature differences between night and day increased in the small strip of land around the equator where the trees can thrive. Compounded by disease, it made sure too many harvests failed.",
      "At the same time across the world, populations lifted themselves out of poverty, middle classes expanded in places like China and the craving for the delicacy increased.",
      "And making matters worse, the years of slumping prices for the beans simply drove farmers off the land to look for a better future in the cities and pushed production further down. De Selliers said that \u201c60 % of cocoa comes from Ivory Coast and Ghana and these farmers have to make a better living. It is extremely important.\u201d",
      "Persoone concurred: \u201cWe didn't pay enough to have an honest price for the farmers.\u201d",
      "So, strangely enough, low prices then, help cause high prices now.",
      "\u201cThe big irony in the cocoa industry is that farmers are now getting a fair price at the moment they are abandoning cocoa farming,\u201d Van Besien said. \u201cWith the price they are getting right now, they could have invested in sustainable practices. They could have sent their children to school.\u201d",
      "Does it mean a premier box of chocolates is a guilty pleasure on Valentine's Day?",
      "\u201cYeah, the guilt question .... It's one that always works,\u201d said Van Besien, the fair trade expert. \u201cWe could not survive if we would be thinking about these things all the time,\u201d arguing that legislation should trump consumer emotions.",
      "\u201cWe should have laws that make buying cocoa below the cost of the production something illegal. And it should not be up to the consumer to make this decision,\u201d he said. Both de Selliers and Persoone hope that if the prices drop down again, they stay around the $5,000 or $6,000 mark.",
      "\u201cI really, really hope the money goes to the farmers,\u201d Persoone said.",
      "So in the meantime, despite the price hikes, the chocolate shouldn't leave too bitter a taste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small luxury that most people still can afford,\u201d Persoone said. \"I hope it stays like this.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk has called for the United States to \u201cdelete entire agencies\u201d from the federal government",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk called on Thursday for the United States to \u201cdelete entire agencies\u201d from the federal government as part of his push under President Donald Trump to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.",
      "Musk offered a wide-ranging survey via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, of what he described as the priorities of the Trump administration interspersed with multiple references to \u201cthermonuclear warfare\u201d and the possible dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cWe really have here rule of the bureaucracy as opposed to rule of the people \u2014 democracy,\u201d Musk said, wearing a black T-shirt that read: \u201cTech Support.\u201d He also joked that he was the \u201cWhite House\u2019s tech support,\u201d borrowing from his profile on the social platform X, which he owns.",
      "\u201cI think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t remove the roots of the weed, then it\u2019s easy for the weed to grow back.\u201d",
      "While Musk has spoken to the summit in the past, his appearance on Thursday comes as he has consolidated control over large swaths of the government with Trump\u2019s blessing since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. That\u2019s included sidelining career officials, gaining access to sensitive databases and inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",
      "Musk's new role imbued his comments with more weight beyond being the world\u2019s wealthiest person through his investments in SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla.",
      "His remarks also offered a more-isolationist view of American power in the Middle East, where the U.S. has fought wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
      "\u201cA lot of attention has been on USAID for example,\u201d Musk said, referring to Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. \u201cThere's like the National Endowment for Democracy. But I\u2019m like, \u2018Okay, well, how much democracy have they achieved lately?\u2019\u201d",
      "He added that the U.S. under Trump is \u201cless interested in interfering with the affairs of other countries.\u201d",
      "There are \u201ctimes the United States has been kind of pushy in international affairs, which may resonate with some members of the audience,\u201d Musk said, speaking to the crowd in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms.",
      "\"Basically, America should mind its own business, rather than push for regime change all over the place,\u201d he said.",
      "He also noted the Trump administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion work, at one point linking it to AI.",
      "\u201cIf hypothetically, AI is designed for DEI, you know, diversity at all costs, it could decide that there\u2019s too many men in power and execute them,\u201d Musk said.",
      "On AI, Musk said he believed X's newly updated AI chatbot, Grok 3, would be ready in about two weeks, calling it at one point \u201ckind of scary.\u201d",
      "He criticized Sam Altman's management of OpenAI, which Musk just led a $97.4 billion takeover bid for, describing it as akin to a nonprofit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a \"lumber company that chops down the trees.\u201d A court filing Wednesday on Musk's behalf in the OpenAI dispute said he'd withdraw his bid if the ChatGPT maker drops its plan to convert into a for-profit company.",
      "Musk also announced plans for a \u201cDubai Loop\u201d project in line with his work in the Boring Company \u2014 which is digging tunnels in Las Vegas to speed transit.",
      "A later statement from Dubai's crown prince, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, said the city-state and the Boring Company \u201cwill explore the development\u201d of a 17-kilometer (10.5-mile) underground network with 11 stations that could transport over 20,000 passengers an hour. He offered no financial terms for the deal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like a wormhole,\" Musk promised. \"You just wormhole from one part of the city \u2014 boom \u2014 and you're out in another part of the city.\u201d",

      "Donald Trump promised as a candidate that he could easily conquer inflation, but the reality is proving tougher than he expected",
      "WASHINGTON -- As a candidate last year, Donald Trump suggested he could easily conquer inflation and ease voters' fears about the economy.",
      "\u201cI will very quickly deflate,\u201d he promised at a California rally. \u201cWe are going to take inflation, and we are going to deflate it. We are going to deflate inflation. We are going to defeat inflation. We\u2019re going to knock the hell out of inflation.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's consumer price index report showed that inflation is punching back \u2014 and President Trump could end up facing the same challenges that dragged down his predecessor, President Joe Biden.",
      "The annual inflation rate has risen in the three months since the November election to 3%, with gasoline prices climbing despite Trump's claims that his return to the White House would signal increased oil production that would lower energy costs.",
      "Trump frequently makes far-reaching assertions about his power to bring about change only to find that it is no match for market forces. It\u2019s a humbling reminder that even U.S. presidents are subject to the invisible hand of supply and demand, rather than the masters of it.",
      "Consumer sentiment measures suggest the public already sees Trump\u2019s plans to expand tariffs as increasing inflation. On Wednesday, the president called for interest rate cuts, even though rate hikes by the Federal Reserve helped lower inflation that spiked at a four-decade high in 2022.",
      "The latest consumer price figures have unnerved economists and the financial markets because they suggest that strong consumer spending, solid job gains and a falling unemployment rate could reignite inflation. Steady demand, particularly from wealthier consumers, makes it easier for companies to keep raising prices.",
      "The cost of goods \u2014 including toys and auto parts \u2014 rose last month even before the imposition of tariffs. Trump has placed 10% tariffs on China, in addition to announcing the removal of exemptions on his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs. There are also potential tariff hikes on Canada and Mexico and a potential executive order that would increase tariffs to match the import taxes charged by other countries.",
      "All of this means that baseline inflationary pressures could be at their highest level in decades.",
      "\u201cDisinflation may be dead, and we may be looking at a higher rate of inflation than we observed for the 20 years prior to the pandemic,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a tax and advisory firm.",
      "Trump's call for lower rates puts him in opposition to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.",
      "\u201cIf inflation goes up in general, we will use our tools, which is the interest rate, to bring it back down to 2% over time,\" Powell told a congressional committee on Wednesday. Powell also said that Trump's calls to lower rates wouldn't sway the Fed.",
      "So far, the Trump White House's main response to this challenge has been to blame Biden, an argument with a short lifespan as Trump is exerting more control over economic policy.",
      "\u201cThe Biden administration indeed left us with a mess to deal with,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Wednesday's news briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s far worse than I think anybody anticipated.\u201d",
      "But Trump allies are also starting to float new ideas for tackling inflation. Standing in the Oval Office on Tuesday, billionaire Elon Musk, the head of the president's Department of Government Efficiency, proposed $1 trillion in spending cuts this year.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who continues to control Tesla, X and SpaceX among other companies, wants to eliminate $1 out of every $7 spent by the federal government in order to bring the inflation rate to zero. It's not clear based on lawsuits and Congress' responsibility for government funding that Musk can deliver those savings.",
      "\u201cIf you cut the budget deficit by a trillion between now and next year, there is no inflation,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd if the government is not borrowing as much, it means that interest costs decline. So everyone\u2019s mortgage, their car payment, their credit card bills, anything, their student debt, the monthly payments drop. That\u2019s a fantastic scenario for the average American.\u201d",
      "Such a steep cut might bring lower prices but also the pain of a sharp economic downturn.",
      "\u201cThat would be a roughly 4% of GDP cut to federal spending, all in one year,\u201d said Michael Linden, a senior policy fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cIt would be an instant recession.\u201d",
      "For now, markets are anticipating more inflation as consumer demand stays strong and Trump has yet to show how exactly his policies would keep prices low, as he promised to voters.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped Wednesday to 4.62% in response to the inflation report, a sign that investors expect interest rates, growth and inflation to be higher in the coming months.",
      "Consumers also say that inflation will rise. Americans' expectations of inflation over the next year have soared, according to the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey. The February survey said that inflation this year will be 4.3%, up sharply from 3.3% the previous month. Many respondents mentioned tariffs as a concern.",
      "When asked Wednesday why Trump\u2019s call for lower interest rates would temper inflation, Leavitt focused on what the president \u201cwants\u201d instead of what he would do.",
      "\u201cHe wants interest rates to be lower,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants inflation to be lower. And he believes that the whole of government economic approach that this administration is taking will result in lower inflation.\u201d"

      "While Rodgers hasn\u2019t said whether he intends to continue playing for a 21st NFL season, the Jets \u2014 with new general manager Darren Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn in charge \u2014 have officially ruled out a return to New York.",
      "In a joint statement issued by the team, Mougey and Glenn said they met with the 41-year-old quarterback last week and informed him of their plans.",
      "\u201cIt was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures,\" Mougey and Glenn said in the statement. \"We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward.\u201d",
      "The four-time MVP, who\u2019s the fifth player in NFL history to throw 500 touchdown passes in the regular season, has one year of non-guaranteed money left on his contract with the Jets.",
      "New York would absorb a $49 million dead money charge next season unless it designates Rodgers a post-June 1 cut and can spread out that charge over two years.",
      "In April 2023, Rodgers was traded to the Jets after 18 seasons with the Green Bay Packers \u2014 looking to help the franchise end a Super Bowl drought which dates to the glory days of Joe Namath and the 1968 season.",
      "Rodgers\u2019 first season in New York ended just four snaps into his debut because of a torn left Achilles tendon that sank the Jets\u2019 Super Bowl hopes that were stirred by the QB\u2019s arrival.",
      "He worked his way back to the field to start every game this past season, but he and the offense struggled with consistency and results and the Jets finished 5-12.",
      "\u201cI personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets,\u201d owner Woody Johnson in a statement. \u201cHis arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From Day 1, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here.",
      "\"He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next.\u201d",
      "Rodgers\u2019 28 touchdown passes and 3,897 yards passing both rank third for a single season in franchise history. But he lacked some mobility early in his return and then dealt with a few additional leg injuries, including a significant hamstring ailment.",
      "The Jets\u2019 offense with Rodgers struggled to produce, the defense was a shell of its formerly dominant self and it cost both general manager Joe Douglas and coach Robert Saleh their jobs in the middle of the season.",
      "In what turned out to be his final appearance with New York, Rodgers threw a season-high four touchdown passes in a win over Miami on Jan. 5.",
      "It was a vintage performance \u2014 and a somewhat frustrating flash to fans of how things could have gone for Rodgers and the Jets.",

      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Dale Earnhardt Jr. blinked back tears as the moment socked him at Daytona International Speedway \u2014 a track bursting with triumph and tragedy for his family \u2014 that he was, with a country star and a NASCAR champ in tow, back in the Daytona 500.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t believe that we get to race on Sunday,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe it.\u201d",
      "Believe it, Junior.",
      "Long NASCAR's most popular driver as he built a Hall of Fame racing career in the intimidating shadow of his father, Earnhardt and his JR Motorsports team celebrated Thursday night at the track where he both won two Daytona 500s and suffered the loss of his father on the last lap in the 2001 race.",
      "\u201cDaddy loved Daytona,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cLoved winning here. Just loved to win any race here. He loved to add to that number whatever it was (34 total). Gosh, I loved coming here as a kid. Just a lot of great memories. So when he passed away, I had to make a decision, I had a career in front of me and I was coming back multiple times. I had to figure out a way to be OK with it.\"",
      "Earnhardt knew only joy and gratitude at the track as JR Motorsports and reigning Xfinity Series champion Justin Allgaier qualified for the season-opening \u201cGreat American Race\u201d and secured their Cup Series debut with their performance in a 150-mile qualifying race at Daytona.",
      "Earnhardt bearhugged and head-locked all his crewmembers, friends and family \u2014 that includes his race team partner, sister Kelley Earnhardt-Miller \u2014 as he climbed down the pit box and snaked his way to pit road. His lips quivering, hands shaking before the race, Earnhardt clutched Allgaier in pure bliss as the dream of moving up to the elite Cup Series level became a reality under the lights at Daytona.",
      "\u201cMan, we have kind of tried to downplay how badly we want to race in the Cup Series,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cAt least I have. It's one of those things where you're like, if it's meant to be, it's meant to be.\u201d",
      "Outside of two full seasons a decade ago, the 38-year-old Allgaier never made a serious run at a Cup career but found new life in NASCAR's second-tier series. He has 25 career wins and won his first Xfinity title last season. He finished second in 2020 and 2023 and blossomed into one of the most popular drivers during his 14 seasons on the Xfinity series.",

      "Normally a beer drinker (Budweiser Select 55 is his favorite), Earnhardt might have to do cheers to his good fortune with some \"Tennessee Whiskey.\"",
      "JR Motorsports made a run at Daytona in large part because of a partnership with Grammy Award-winning artist Chris Stapleton. Allgaier, who has two previous Daytona 500 starts, and his No. 40 Chevrolet are sponsored by Stapleton's whiskey label, and the singer was expected to attend the Daytona 500. There's more star power inside the car, with the Chevy powered by a Hendrick Motorsports engine.",
      "Earnhardt was crushed after the race team \u2014 one of nine open teams trying to fill the final four spots in the Daytona field \u2014 failed to lock in a spot the previous night in qualifying.",
      "\u201cI didn't really know exactly how badly I wanted to do this or wanted to be a part of something like this until we started going through it,\u201d he said. \u201cYesterday was just so tough to understand, something as simple as being eight-thousandths too slow was really hard to understand. It's hard to accept. I've just been sitting here all day thinking about how badly I wanted this for all of us.\u201d",
      "Earnhardt won two Daytona 500s, in 2004 and 2014, and 26 races overall. But he never won a Cup championship or came close to matching the achievements of his late Hall of Fame father, Dale, who won seven titles and was known as \u201cThe Intimidator.\u201d",
      "It might have been easy for Earnhardt's professional successes through the decades at Daytona to get swallowed by the grief following his father's death",
      "\u201cI probably need a psychiatrist to describe it,\u201d he said to laughter.",
      "Candid as ever, the 50-year-old Earnhardt insisted he's learned to accept his dad's death as part of the long arc of life rather than grounds to forever blame and hate the famed track.",
      "\u201cI knew that it wasn't the track that took him. I knew that wherever he was, he still felt the same about Daytona,\" Earnhardt said. \"So, I've embraced it. Him losing his life in this property brought this property closer to me. That doesn't work the same with other people and tragedy, but for me, knowing I had to keep coming here, I made some peace with it, embraced the track and loved it.\u201d",
      "Earnhardt loves Daytona, too.",
      "As the tears flowed, it was conceivable to think Earnhardt might not have ever loved it more.",
      "\u201cWe get to push a car on the grid Sunday for the first time ever,\u201d Earnhardt said. \u201cIn the biggest, most important race that I\u2019ve ever known. And I can\u2019t wait.\u201d",

      "Finishing fourth when medals are on the line can feel like cruel punishment",
      "SAALBACH-HINTERGLEMM, Austria -- Finishing fourth when medals are on the line can feel like cruel punishment.",
      "Paula Moltzan knows the feeling all too well.",
      "Already at this year's Alpine skiing world championships, she was on the U.S. squad that finished fourth in the mixed team parallel event. Then she couldn\u2019t hold on to the lead that partner Lauren Macuga had set up in the downhill portion of the new team combined event and ended up fourth with her slalom run.",
      "Also on the U.S. team that finished fourth in the team parallel at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, Moltzan\u2019s only major medal had been a victory with the U.S. team in the same event at the last worlds two years ago.",
      "Until Thursday, when Moltzan took the bronze medal in giant slalom for her first individual medal at this level, finishing a mere hundredth of a second ahead of Thea Louise Stjernesund of Norway \u2014 in a race won by Federica Brignone of Italy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s feeling pretty special right now,\u201d Moltzan said. \u201cSki racing big time comes down to the hundredths of a second. And so to be on the right side on a big stage feels pretty amazing. And to share it with my family and my husband and my whole team is unmatched.\u201d",
      "Moltzan was third in the opening run held in bright sunshine and then maintained her position in fading light during the second run. Knowing immediately that she had earned a medal, the Minnesota native pumped her arms up and down, threw her hands on top of her helmet in apparent disbelief and waved to her cheering squad in the stands decked out in USA hockey jerseys with Moltzan\u2019s name on the back.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s my mom and my dad and my mother-in-law, my father-in-law. And then our two really good friends from Vermont and then my agent,\u201d Moltzan said.",
      "Of course, there was one other special person enjoying the medal, too: Husband Ryan Mooney, who is Moltzan\u2019s ski technician and unofficial coach, eventually skied down from the start and took part in the post-race podium celebration.",
      "Long regarded as the U.S. women\u2019s team\u2019s second-best technical skier behind Mikaela Shiffrin, Moltzan\u2019s medal came in a race that Shiffrin sat out as defending champion while still recovering her giant slalom form and mental state following a crash in November.",
      "Moltzan also finished third in the final World Cup giant slalom before the worlds. She had a string of solid results entering the last worlds, too, only to break her hand again while helping the Americans win the team event \u2014 which led to a DNF (did not finish) in giant slalom and forced her to sit out the slalom, which has traditionally been her best event.",
      "Moltzan won gold in slalom at the junior worlds a decade ago but then lost her spot on the U.S. team a year later because of poor results.",
      "So she enrolled at the University of Vermont and won the NCAA slalom title a year later. While still at UVM in 2018, she finished 17th in the World Cup slalom down the road at Killington, giving her enough World Cup points to head back over to Europe and resume World Cup racing.",
      "Only she still wasn\u2019t part of the U.S. team, meaning that she and then-boyfriend Mooney had to raise $50,000 on their own to travel and compete across the Alps.",
      "\u201cI definitely have an unconventional story,\u201d Moltzan said. \u201cBut I\u2019m proud of every step of it and it feels good to add this to the list of accomplishments I have.\u201d",
      "Both of Moltzan\u2019s parents were ski instructors at Buck Hill in Minnesota and Moltzan moved into the elite program led there by Lindsey Vonn\u2019s former coach, Erich Sailer, when she was 12.",
      "Now she\u2019s established herself as a contender for a medal at next year\u2019s Milan-Cortina Olympics, with Vonn also planning to compete at the age of 41.",
      "Moltzan became the fourth American woman to earn a medal at this year's worlds, after Macuga\u2019s bronze in the super-G, Breezy Johnson\u2019s downhill victory and gold for Johnson and Shiffrin in team combined.",
      "\u201cThe women\u2019s U.S. Ski Team right now is extremely strong in both tech and speed, and it feels like everything is just kind of working off each other,\u201d Moltzan said. \u201cYou watch the speed girls compete and their passion and their speed and you just feel like, \u2019OK, well, I don\u2019t want to be the athlete or the team that doesn\u2019t medal today.' And obviously we\u2019re missing Mikaela Shiffrin here. But I think even without her, we are a very strong team in GS.\u201d",
      "Shiffrin will be back for Saturday\u2019s slalom \u2014 as will Moltzan \u2014 with both chasing their second medal of the championships.",

      "Fans in Montreal booed the U.S. national anthem prior to the Americans\u2019 first game of the 4 Nations Face-Off against Finland on Thursday night",
      "MONTREAL -- Fans in Montreal booed the U.S. national anthem prior to the Americans\u2019 first game of the 4 Nations Face-Off against Finland on Thursday night, and Stanley Cup-winning forward Matthew Tkachuk had a simple reaction.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t like it, and that\u2019s all I got,\" Tkachuk said after the U.S. beat Finland 6-1. Tkachuk and brother Brady each had two goals.",
      "The negative reaction to \"The Star-Spangled Banner\u201d came even after the public address announcer at Bell Centre made an announcement asking the crowd to show respect for the anthems and the players from either country.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to make sure that we create an environment and that hockey represents an opportunity to bring people together, and I think people understand that,\u201d Commissioner Gary Bettman said Wednesday at a news conference prior to the start of the tournament. \u201cIn this building, initially there was some booing a couple of games ago and the club made an announcement asking people to stop and show respect for two great countries, and it stopped. And that\u2019s what we expect.\u201d",
      "U.S. center J.T. Miller put a positive spin on the song getting booed.",
      "\u201cI think we like it, not politically, but maybe just at a sense of, we know where we\u2019re at in Canada and I think that fires us up more than anything,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s great.\u201d",
      "There was no such reaction for Finland\u2019s national anthem that followed. Fans across Canada have booed the U.S. anthem at NHL and NBA games after President Donald Trump threatened tariffs against the country, prompting backlash from a close neighbor and longtime ally.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, obviously, and we wish it wasn\u2019t the case, but from time to time things happen, and people have strong feelings about it,\u201d Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said Wednesday. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re aware of what\u2019s been happening here. I think the negativity has probably lessened over the last week. Hopefully it continues to lessen and that relations will be normal. But it\u2019s something obviously we\u2019re aware of.\u201d",
      "U.S. captain Auston Matthews was booed during a pregame ceremony before Canada vs. Sweden on Wednesday and then again when he was shown on video screens during warmups. Matthews said after his team's morning skate that he expected that reaction.",
      "\u201cThey might just be booing us because we\u2019re the U.S. team here, like Auston\u2019s getting booed a ton and whatnot,\" defenseman Zach Werenski said. \"Obviously, I\u2019m a proud American and I love playing for the USA and being an American. I don\u2019t want to get into the political side of it, but it is what it is. I like to just view it as they want us to lose because we\u2019re the U.S. team.\u201d",
      "Coach Mike Sullivan said his players are proud Americans but did not credit the anthem booing as any sort of motivation that contributed to the result.",
      "\u201cThe anthem, I'm not sure there\u2019s influence there,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cThat\u2019s really not something that we can control. We just want to play hockey. We want to compete. We want to represent our nation in the right way.\u201d",
      "The next U.S. game at the tournament is Saturday night against Canada before play shifts to Boston next week.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 09:14:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Aaron Rodgers&rsquo; tenure with the New York Jets began with lots of fanfare and Super Bowl aspirations",
    "story": [
      "Aaron Rodgers\u2019 tenure with the New York Jets began with lots of fanfare and Super Bowl aspirations",
      "Aaron Rodgers' tenure with the New York Jets began with lots of fanfare and Super Bowl aspirations.",
      "It ended less than two years later with a disappointing thud.",
      "The Jets slammed the door on the 41-year-old quarterback potentially returning to the team when new head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey issued a joint statement Thursday saying they told Rodgers last week \u201cthat our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback.\u201d",
      "Rodgers will likely be designated a post-June 1 cut for salary cap reasons, but would be able to be released after the NFL's new league year begins on March 12.",
      "The four-time MVP hasn't announced his playing plans, saying several times in recent weeks that he'll take some time to consider whether he wants to continue his career for a 21st season or retire.",
      "While he faces an offseason of uncertainty, one thing is clear: If Rodgers wants to get back in the huddle, it won't be with the Jets. But a few quarterback-needy teams could be potential landing spots.",
      "They have the No. 1 overall pick in the draft in April and the Titans could target a quarterback such as Colorado's Shedeur Sanders or Miami's Cam Ward. Bringing in Rodgers could allow them to focus on other positions in the draft. But with a new general manager in place in Mike Borgonzi and a young head coach in 40-year-old Brian Callahan, would they want to take on an aging QB in what is a likely rebuild?",
      "Deshaun Watson might miss the entire 2025 season after he ruptured his Achilles tendon for the second time in three months, and his status with the team moving forward was already shaky. The Browns have the second overall pick, so they\u2019ll certainly have a shot at Sanders or Ward. But even if they draft one of them, Rodgers could allow them to sit and learn for at least a season.",
      "Daniel Jones is already long gone and Tommy DeVito is the only quarterback on the Giants\u2019 roster under contract for next season. New York has the No. 3 pick, so Sanders or Ward could be in play. But coach Brian Daboll and GM Joe Schoen don\u2019t have a lot of time to turn things around. They were retained after the season, but co-owner John Mara made it clear he needs to see marked improvement. Bringing in Rodgers would be a last-ditch effort to stabilize things. Plus, Rodgers wouldn\u2019t have to move and he\u2019s already familiar with MetLife Stadium.",
      "Sure, Rodgers' buddy Davante Adams insisted on leaving Las Vegas and reuniting with his former Green Bay quarterback in New York. But this is a new regime with head coach Pete Carroll and GM John Spytek. Aidan O'Connell and Gardner Minshew are the possible starters next season, especially since having the No. 6 pick likely takes the Raiders out of play for one of the top quarterbacks. But Carroll and minority owner Tom Brady could be an attractive combo for Rodgers, who would provide the Raiders with a bridge to a young QB.",
      "The Steelers have made the playoffs the last two seasons and four of the past five under coach Mike Tomlin, but failed to get out of the wild-card round in any. Owner Art Rooney II said it's unlikely both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields will be back, with his preference the Steelers choose one to return. Rodgers' availability might change things as he could step into a playoff-ready team that's looking for its first postseason win since 2016.",
      "Rodgers grew up in the Bay Area rooting for the 49ers and idolizing Joe Montana, and it appeared he could live out his childhood dream when San Francisco had the No. 1 overall pick in 2005. But the 49ers instead went with Alex Smith and Rodgers fell to 24th when the Packers drafted him. Brock Purdy is eligible for a contract extension on his rookie deal and owner Jed York recently said he'd like to see him in San Francisco long-term. But the 49ers missed the playoffs this season after playing in the Super Bowl and Rodgers could be viewed as the missing piece to another long postseason run.",
      "Could Rodgers take the same path Brett Favre did when he left Green Bay, played for the Jets and then went to Minnesota? Well, Sam Darnold could be a free agent after having a career year while leading the Vikings to the playoffs \u2014 although he could get the franchise tag. Jones is still there after leaving the Giants and so is J.J. McCarthy, who missed his entire rookie season with a knee injury. But Rodgers could step into a high-powered offense that includes Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison, T.J. Hockenson and running back Aaron Jones, his former Packers teammate.",
      "New coach Kellen Moore was complimentary of Derek Carr in his introductory news conference Thursday, but stopped short of saying he\u2019d be New Orleans' starting quarterback next season. That certainly created some some speculation that perhaps the Saints could move on from Carr, who has two years left on his contract. Rodgers could step in for Carr, who was the Jets' backup plan when they pursued Rodgers in 2023.",

      "John Franklin III, Ronald Ollie, C.J. Reavis, Deandre Johnson, Tim Bonner and Isaiah Wright say they\u2019re seeking $30 million in damages after receiving no compensation for their contributions to the project. They say they\u2019re holding the defendants accountable \u201cfor the wrongful misappropriation of their likeness and to ensure fair compensation for their work.\u201d",
      "Franklin, Ollie and Reavis played for East Mississippi in 2015. Johnson and Bonner were there in 2016. Wright played in both 2015 and 2016.",
      "The list of defendants also includes Conde Nast Entertainment and Greg Whiteley, the director and executive producer of \u201cLast Chance U.\u201d Conde Nast was listed as a production partner of the series, which focused on the lives of junior college football players. The first two of the series\u2019 five seasons focused on East Mississippi.",
      "The plaintiffs say they weren\u2019t given an opportunity to consult an attorney or read their contracts in their entirety before agreeing to have their names and images included in the series. They said that at no point were they made aware the documentary would be marketed for commercial use while they were pressured into \u201cimpulsively signing agreements.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most coercive tactic defendants used upon the plaintiffs was telling them if they did not sign the contracts, they were not eligible to practice,\u201d John Pierce, the lawyer representing the players, said in a complaint filed last week at Los Angeles County superior court. \u201cIn turn, they would not be eligible to play games, and their football skills would deteriorate. Inability to practice meant closing the door on what they committed their whole life towards, eventually playing professional football. Plaintiffs had no real negotiation or any meaningful choice except signing what was presented to them without ever being instructed of the purpose of filming or being advised to read through the contract in its entirety.\u201d",
      "The complaint indicates East Mississippi sold merchandise involving the players portrayed in the series, but that the plaintiffs didn\u2019t receive any compensation. It also says Wright, Ollie and Franklin were portrayed in a false light, damaging their reputations.",

      "Drayton died unexpectedly on Monday in Toronto, according to Cardinal Funeral Homes. Runners World magazine said he died during knee surgery.",
      "Born in Germany with the name Peter Buniak, Drayton changed his name after immigrating to Canada in 1956. He won Detroit's Motor City Marathon in 1969 in a North American record time of 2 hours, 12 minutes, and shaved 47 seconds off the mark in winning the Fukuoka Marathon in Japan later that year.",
      "He won the 1973 Canadian championship before finishing third in Boston in 1974. Three years later \u2014 his fifth try in Boston \u2014 he pulled ahead when eventual four-time winner Bill Rodgers began to tire in the 77-degree heat and gave Canada its first victory in the race in three decades. Drayton finished second at the New York Marathon that fall.",

      "Drayton also set a world record on the track for the 10-mile run in 1970 in 46:37.6, and was the top Canadian in the men's marathon at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal.

      "It's a complicated rule that was written into the charter agreement that 13 teams signed last September and is similar to a \u201cpromoters provisional\u201d in that it gives NASCAR the ability to designate one driver as a guaranteed 41st entry.",

      "\u201cI think Jimmie Johnson is a world-class driver, but I guess other people don\u2019t,\u201d Alex Bowman said. \"It\u2019s an interesting rule for sure. There\u2019s a lot of hype and importance to the sport to have people like (Castroneves) that come in and, if they miss the race, it kind of hurts the whole thing.",
      "\"So I get it, but I also wish some of our past champions were respected in the same way in some sense.\u201d",
      "Castroneves will use the provisional only if he fails in traditional qualifying to claim one of the four open spots in what was supposed to be a 40-car field. If he uses it, the 41 cars will be the most in the Daytona 500 since 2015, when 43 cars was still standard.",
      "Trackhouse and Castroneves also won't receive any points or payouts if he's the 41st driver, and all drivers who finish behind him will be moved up one position in the standings.",
      "The rule has divided the field, even though it probably will come into play only at Daytona International Speedway, where nine drivers are vying for the four open spots. NASCAR's charter system guarantees entry to 36 cars every race.",
      "\u201cAside from the Daytona 500, we don\u2019t get in a spot very often where drivers of that caliber are going home,\" Tyler Reddick said. \"I don\u2019t know where to fall on this. On one hand, I would hate for a guy like Lewis Hamilton to come over here and attempt to start the 500... (and) something keeps him from running the race. We also don\u2019t just want to let them have a spot in the race \u2014 like, they have to earn it.\u201d",
      "Logically, if multiple drivers had requested the provisional, the most sense would have been for it to go to the highest qualifier.",
      "Nope.",
      "If NASCAR does receive multiple requests, NASCAR will decide who the designated \u201cworld-class driver\u201d is ahead of the event. The criteria listed in the charter for the rule states \"the \u201cOpen Exemption\u201d position is intended for a driver who will significantly impact the promotion of the event and grow the prominence of the sport.",
      "In a competition briefing held for media last month, a hypothetical scenario was posed about what NASCAR would do if seven-time Formula 1 champion Hamilton, four-time F1 champion Max Verstappen, six-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon and Johnson, who is also a NASCAR Hall of Famer, all put in a request for the same race.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d love to have that problem,\u201d said John Probst, NASCAR senior vice president of racing development.",
      "NASCAR could have that problem later this year when it goes to Mexico City, where several teams are exploring deals to enter Juan Pablo Montoya in the race, and who knows who could show up at a road course \u2014 Shane van Gisbergen was brought into the inaugural street race at Chicago, won it and by the end of the year had left his Australian V8 Supercars career behind for NASCAR.",
      "At Indianapolis in 2023, former F1 drivers Jenson Button and Kamui Kobayashi were both in the field, while Button was part of the same field as Kimi Raikkonen to make it two F1 world champions in the 2023 race at Circuit of the Americas.",
      "\u201cI can argue both sides of the fence. You\u2019d hate to have a Helio Castroneves, a Max Verstappen, a Lewis Hamilton or someone come in to run a race and then miss the show due to something silly,\u201d Chase Elliott said. \"So I can certainly see that aspect of it from a promoter. But I also think that with prestigious races, there should be some sort of integrity in making the show.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s part of what makes the race prestigious. You know, it\u2019s a hard event to make. I think you see that with the Indianapolis 500, or you see that at the Chili Bowl, right? It\u2019s a hard race to make. It\u2019s a big deal just to get into the show. I just don\u2019t want to ever degrade or hurt the long-term integrity of the sport and take the prestige out of events that should be some of our biggest days of the year.\u201d",

      "Winning multiple titles in that short a time period is far from rare in the NFL, with the league often dominated by transcendent coach-quarterback combinations.",
      "Doing so with different people in those key positions is extremely unusual. Only two other teams have ever won multiple Super Bowls in a span of eight seasons with a different coach and different quarterback in both wins.",
      "The Raiders broke through with their first title in the 1976 season when coach John Madden and quarterback Ken Stabler led Oakland to a 13-1 record and a Super Bowl win over Minnesota. The Raiders did it again four years later when Tom Flores and Jim Plunkett led them past the Eagles in Super Bowl 15.",
      "The 49ers did it as well as their dynasty extended long past Bill Walsh's retirement. Walsh and Joe Montana collaborated on three championships from the 1981-88 seasons before Walsh stepped down. George Seifert then won the Super Bowl in his first season in 1989 with Montana and again in 1994 with Steve Young at quarterback.",
      "The Raiders had 11 players appear in both Super Bowl wins, while the 49ers had six, including Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and four other players who started on offense in both Super Bowl 23 and 29.",
      "The Eagles had a bigger roster turnover with only right tackle Lane Johnson, defensive end Brandon Graham, kicker Jake Elliott and long snapper Jake Lovato appearing in both wins.",
      "The main constant between Philadelphia's two titles was general manager Howie Roseman, who has now built two championship teams.",
      "The Super Bowl featured firsts for college football powerhouses Alabama and Texas.",
      "Eagles receiver DeVonta Smith\u2019s 46-yard touchdown catch were the first points scored in the Super Bowl by a player who finished his college career at Alabama. NFL scoring rules give credit for points to the player who catches a touchdown \u2014 not who throws it \u2014 so Bart Starr and Stabler\u2019s TD passes didn\u2019t count.",
      "Players who finished their college careers at 144 other schools had scored in the Super Bowl before 12-time AP college football champion Alabama cracked the list.",

      "Hurts drew even with Mahomes in head-to-head Super Bowl matchups.",
      "This game was the fourth rematch between quarterbacks in a Super Bowl with Mahomes and the Chiefs having won in Super Bowl 57. Hurts is the only one to get revenge with the other three all ending in sweeps: Eli Manning over Tom Brady, Troy Aikman over Jim Kelly, and Terry Bradshaw over Roger Staubach.",
      "Hurts also became the fourth player who lost his first Super Bowl as a starting QB to go on to win one as a starter, joining Hall of Famers Len Dawson, Bob Griese and John Elway.",
      "In what was billed as the season of the running back, it was the quarterbacks who led both teams in rushing.",
      "Hurts ran for 72 yards to lead all ball carriers in the game and break his own record of 70 for most ever by a quarterback. The only other quarterback who led the Super Bowl in yards rushing was San Francisco's Steve Young with 49 yards in Super Bowl 29 against San Diego.",
      "Mahomes led the Chiefs with 25 yards rushing, marking the first time that the leading rusher for both teams was a quarterback.",
      "Kansas City got only 24 yards rushing from its running backs for the fourth lowest total ever.",
      "Even Eagles star Saquon Barkley struggled to get going with just 57 yards on 25 carries with his 2.28 yards per carry the worst for any player with at least 20 attempts in a Super Bowl.",
      "That doesn't take away from what Barkley accomplished this season with his 2,504 yards rushing in the regular season and playoffs breaking the record of 2,476 set by Terrell Davis in 1998.",

      "About a year ago at this time, Mac McClung thought his dunk-contest days were done",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- About a year ago at this time, Mac McClung thought his dunk contest days were done. He'd been in the contest at the NBA's All-Star weekend twice, won it both times with plenty of flair and figured there was nothing else to prove.",
      "Then a week later, he found himself practicing new dunks. And that's when he quickly realized that he has one \u2014 and he insists, only one \u2014 dunk contest left in him.",
      "\u201cI love the contest, man,\" McClung said. \u201cIt'd be an action in fear not to do it again. So, I'll do it \u2014 one last time.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-2 McClung \u2014 a standout guard in the G League who has appeared in only five NBA games \u2014 is headed back to All-Star weekend, looking to become the first person to win the league's dunk title in three consecutive years. Nate Robinson is the only three-time dunk champion, though his didn't come in back-to-back-to-back years.",
      "McClung breathed new life into the dunk contest and got rave reviews from some of the NBA's biggest names when he first won it in 2023, then went airborne over Shaquille O'Neal to win it again last year. Now he goes for three in a row in San Francisco on Saturday night, with San Antonio rookie Stephon Castle, Chicago rookie Matas Buzelis and Milwaukee second-year wing Andre Jackson Jr. providing the competition.",
      "\u201cI'm not going there to lose,\u201d Buzelis said.",
      "Added Jackson: \u201cI just want to be myself and put on a show.\u201d",
      "Castle is confident as well, though acknowledged he expects to feel some nerves on Saturday night.",
      "\u201cI get nervous for most games,\u201d Castle said. \u201cI think it's just going to be another event for me.\u201d",
      "When this weekend is over, they'll all head back to their NBA jobs. McClung, for now, continues to wait for a real opportunity.",
      "His five NBA games have come with four NBA teams \u2014 one with Chicago, one with the Los Angeles Lakers, two with Philadelphia and one with Orlando. He's scored 33 points in those games, 20 coming in one contest with the 76ers at Brooklyn on April 9, 2023.",
      "He hasn't scored an NBA point since that day.",
      "\u201cThe easy answer is opportunity,\" McClung said. \u201cIt's not just Mac McClung. There's a lot of G League guys that can play in the league. There\u2019s a lot of guys I\u2019ve seen in the G League and then they get an opportunity in the (NBA) and people are like, \u2018Man, he got so much better this last year.' And I'm like, \u2018No, he\u2019s been good.' I really have my faith in God, and believe I\u2019m always right where I\u2019m supposed to be.\u201d",
      "For now, that's with the Osceola Magic. He's on a two-way contract with Orlando, and McClung is averaging 24.5 points and 6.1 assists during this G League regular season. He's been rookie of the year, he's been a G League champion and this season he's the reigning G League MVP.",
      "\u201cI take pride in the G League,\u201d McClung said. \u201cEach year it's so hard because when you're on a two-way people are like \u2018Be ready, stay ready.\u2019 But I'm trying to win in the G League. That's important to me. Winning a championship is always the standard and hopefully we can do that this year in Osceola and apply even more pressure.\u201d",
      "Winning back-to-back dunk contests has brought a ton of notoriety. People recognize McClung more now, but he hasn't changed. He's comfortable in jeans and T-shirts, drives a Ford Bronco, has the same group of friends that will smack him back in line if he gets out of line. He's proud to be the small-town kid from Gate City, Virginia \u2014 who just happens to be able to jump higher than most people and has become one of the most famous dunkers in the world.",
      "He's been offered chances to play in Europe for bigger money than he's making in the G League, too. But the dream remains the NBA, and McClung isn't ready to give up on it. He's always been the underdog and typically has found a way to turn his hopes into reality.",
      "\u201cIt's funny. I don\u2019t even look at myself as a dunker,\" McClung said. \u201cThe people that know me best know I'm a competitor first. Obviously, I haven\u2019t made an impact in the league yet or anything like that, but that\u2019s who I want to be and where I want to be. That\u2019s truly where my heart is.\u201d",
      "He'll be back on the NBA stage on Saturday, with a shot at dunking his way into history.",

      "New Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Spencer Horwitz is expected to miss most of spring training after undergoing surgery on his right wrist",
      "BRADENTON, Fla. -- Newly acquired Pittsburgh Pirates first baseman Spencer Horwitz is expected to miss most of spring training after undergoing surgery on his right wrist.",
      "Horwitz, acquired in a trade with Cleveland in December, will be out at least 6-8 weeks, though Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said Tuesday the team is not putting an exact timetable on a possible return.",
      "The 27-year-old Horwitz hit .265 with 12 home runs and 40 RBIs in 97 games with Toronto last season. The Blue Jays shipped him to Cleveland in December and hours later the Guardians sent him to Pittsburgh in exchange for pitcher Luis Ortiz and two prospects.",
      "Horwitz had been dealing with what the Pirates called a \u201cchronic\u201d wrist problem. Cherington said the team was aware of the issue at the time of the trade but Horwitz began to experience \u201cnew symptoms\u201d in late January, which led to the decision to have surgery.",
      "The Pirates have multiple internal options to fill first base while Horwitz rehabs, including utility infielder Jared Triolo and Darick Hall, who split time between first base and designated hitter with the Philadelphia Phillies in 2022 and 2023. Hall hit 16 home runs in Triple-A last season.",
      "While outfielder Bryan Reynolds took ground balls at first base during practice late in the 2024 season, Cherington said the team is focused on keeping Reynolds in the outfield. Endy Rodriguez, who hasn't played in the majors since undergoing elbow surgery in the fall of 2023, is expected to remain at catcher for now.",

      "Some schools in the region, including city public schools, will close on Friday. City courts will also be closed.",
      "Eagles President Don Smolenski thanked the many diehard fans who \u201cbleed green\u201d for the team. They often take over opponents\u2019 stadiums and turn the contests into home crowd affairs, much as they did at the Superdome in New Orleans, he said.",

      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call",
      "Red Auerbach once got ejected from an All-Star Game for arguing a call. Rick Barry and Bob Cousy each fouled out of All-Star Games twice, the only players who can say that. Dwyane Wade was whistled for the first flagrant All-Star foul after breaking Kobe Bryant\u2019s nose.",
      "As the story goes, Wade called Bryant not long after that 2012 game and attempted to apologize. Turned out, there was no need. Wade\u2019s recollection of what Bryant said? \u201cBro, I love it,\u201d Wade said in a conversation with Kevin Garnett, a clip that has been a social media standard ever since.",
      "The NBA doesn't want coaches to get kicked out, anyone to get into foul trouble or anyone getting hurt. But they've asked, begged and pleaded for years with players in an effort that the All-Star Game get taken more seriously. And the latest solution is a radical one: a mini-tournament.",
      "Welcome to an All-Star format like none other: three games, no clock, first team to 40 points wins, eight-man rosters, and there's a reasonable chance that the team leaving San Francisco on Sunday as winners will have captured that title without having a single All-Star on its roster.",
      "\u201cWe went back to the drawing board,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said.",
      "Here's the big question going into Sunday: Will it work?",
      "To be fair, there were skeptics when Silver added a play-in tournament to determine the final two playoff spots in the Eastern and Western Conferences; by all accounts, the play-in has been a smashing success. There were skeptics when Silver added an in-season tournament now called the NBA Cup; some players say they still don't totally understand the format, but the first two Cup final four weekends in Las Vegas have been big hits as well.",
      "Now, this. The NBA thinks players don't want to go to a 48-minute All-Star Game and play hard for a full game. Perfectly understandable. The proposed solution: short games, where nobody will have to play for long and there's little room for error since only 40 points are needed to win.",
      "Kevin Durant's first response? \u201cI hate it. Absolutely hate it. Terrible,\u201d the Phoenix star and 15-time All-Star said when the league announced the plan in December, though he quickly noted that his initial reaction could have been worded differently.",
      "Perhaps he could have taken the route that perennial All-Star forward Anthony Davis, then of the Los Angeles Lakers and now of the Dallas Mavericks, took when he was asked in December what he thinks of the NBA's new plan.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really like it,\u201d Durant said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll see how it goes this year and see if they change it again or not.\u201d",
      "And it could change again, possibly as early as next year.",
      "Some players want the traditional East vs. West format, although the league went back to that last year and it was a 211-186 game \u2014 all dunks and 3-pointers, pretty much \u2014 that broke records and forced the NBA to break the mold on the format.",
      "The NBA tried a target score approach; no clock in the fourth quarter and have the teams chase a set total to ensure that the game ends on a made basket. Some years it worked, some years not so much. They tried having playing captains pick the teams; again, success was mixed.",
      "Next up, the tournament. There is a prize pool of $1.8 million for the All-Star tournament. Each player on the All-Star champion team gets $125,000, each player on the runner-up team will get $50,000 and the players on the teams eliminated in the semifinals will each get $25,000.",
      "\u201cI don't know if everyone understands how this is going to go,\u201d said Miami's Tyler Herro, who'll make his All-Star debut this weekend. \u201cBut everyone will want to win.\u201d",
      "There are four teams in the tournament: three teams picked by Shaquille O'Neal, Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley from the pool of 24 All-Stars, and the fourth will be the team that wins the Rising Stars event on Friday night. The Rising Stars players aren't All-Stars. Some aren't even in the NBA right now; there's a G League team in that event. And the Rising Stars winner could win the All-Star Game \u2014 meaning, yes, guys who aren't currently in the league could win the thing.",
      "Whichever way it shakes out, it will be a massive deviation from last year \u2014 when the East and West each scored at least 42 points in every quarter. Karl-Anthony Towns scored 50 points on his own last year; it'll take only 40 for a team to win a game this year.",
      "\u201cThem trying to shake things up is expected and makes sense,\u201d Oklahoma City All-Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"But at the end of the day, it\u2019s going to come down to whether the players wanting to go at it, and I would love to see that. Love to be a part of that for sure, and hopefully it happens.\u201d",
      "Heat forward Kevin Love \u2014 who proudly says he took part in All-Star Games where players were competitive and even strategized in the locker rooms before games and at halftimes \u2014 doesn't know when the All-Star Game changed.",
      "He thinks it became part of the evolution within the game; more 3-pointers are shot than ever before and that, combined with everyone just treating it like an exhibition and not Game 7 of the NBA Finals, led to the defense-optional approach the league doesn't want to see anymore.",
      "\u201cI'll tell you if this will work,\u201d Love said. \u201cI'll tell you on Sunday.\u201d",

      "Rizwan struck an unbeaten 122 off 128 balls and Salman notched his maiden ODI hundred with 134 off 103 balls as they cruised Pakistan to 355-4 in 49 overs for a six-wicket victory Wednesday to set up Friday\u2019s final against New Zealand.",
      "Pakistan's previous highest successful chase was 349 against Australia at Lahore in 2022.",
      "South Africa had earlier posted 352-5 \u2014 fourth-highest total at the newly upgraded National Bank Stadium \u2014 with Heinrich Klaasen (87), Matthew Breetzke (83) and captain Temba Bavuma (82) all missing out on centuries.",
      "It was the second time in three days that South Africa lost after posting over 300 runs as it failed to defend 304 against New Zealand on Monday.",
      "Rizwan and Salman decimated South Africa pace bowlers Lungi Ngidi (1-74), Corbin Bosch (1-70) and Wiaan Mulder (2-79) on a flat wicket and lightning outfield as they shared a Pakistan record of 260 runs in a match-winning fourth-wicket stand.",
      "With frontline pace bowlers Kagiso Rabada and Marco Jansen joining the South Africa squad for Champions Trophy over the weekend, the three pace bowlers couldn\u2019t pose threat to the pair of Rizwan and Salman in ideal batting conditions.",
      "Mulder had struck twice in his opening spell but Pakistan still managed to rack up over 90 runs in the first power play of 10 overs in an ODI for the first time in 20 years with Fakhar Zaman making a quickfire 41 off 28 balls.",
      "Babar Azam made 23 off 19 balls in the opening stand of 57 off 37 balls before Mulder pinned him leg before wicket and then found the outside of Fakhar\u2019s bat with Klaasen holding onto a sharp catch to his left.",
      "Rizwan and Salman took their time and watchfully played out spinners Tabraiz Shamsi (0-53) and Keshav Maharaj (0-54) in the middle overs before countercharging against the pace.",
      "Rizwan reached his hundred off 106 balls in style with a monstrous six over mid-wicket to Mulder, and three balls later Salman completed his first ODI hundred off 87 balls with a single.",
      "Ngidi got some consolation when Salman, who struck 16 fours and two sixes, edged the fast bowler with only two needed for victory before Tayyab Tahir sealed the game with the boundary off the first ball he faced.",
      "South Africa top-order batters also capitalized on a perfect batting wicket with only left-arm spinner Khushdil Shah (1-39) conceding less than run a ball.",
      "Bavuma and Breetzke batted with lot of aggression against pace and spin after Toni de Zorzi (22), one of the four changes South Africa made from the first match, was brilliantly snapped by Salman in the first slip of Shaheen Shah Afridi (2-66).",
      "Breetzke, who became the first batter to score 150 in his debut ODI on Monday, added 119 off 125 balls with Bavuma as Pakistan bowlers gave away too many lose deliveries.",
      "Bavuma, who hit 13 boundaries, got run-out in a mix-up with Breetzke in the 29th over, but South Africa continued to score at a brisk pace after Klaasen was promoted at No. 4 in his first outing in Pakistan.",
      "Breetzke, overlooked for the Champions Trophy, looked set for his second successive century but Salman took up another stunning catch at short cover in the 39th over to deny South African another record.",
      "Klaasen struck 11 fours and three sixes and played a key part in helping South Africa score 110 runs in the last 10 overs before he holed out in the deep in the penultimate over.",
      "Kyle Verreynne made an unbeaten 44 off 32 balls as South Africa middle-order batters charged against the pace of Afridi and Mohammad Hasnain, who conceded 72 runs for no wickets in his eight overs after being inducted into the playing XI in place of injured Haris Rauf.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:06:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her government is not ruling out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the &ldquo;Gulf of America.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her government is not ruling out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that her government wouldn't rule out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "The area, long named the Gulf of Mexico across the the world, has gained a geopolitical spotlight in recent weeks after President Donald Trump declared he would change the Gulf's name.",
      "Sheinbaum, in her morning press conference on Thursday, said the president's decree is restricted to the \u201ccontinental shelf of the United States\" because Mexico still controls much of the Gulf. \u201cWe have sovereignty over our continental shelf,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said that despite the fact that her government sent a letter to Google saying that the company was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cthe entire Gulf of Mexico cannot be called the Gulf of America,\" the company has insisted on maintaining the nomenclature.",
      "It was not immediately clear where such a suit would be filed.",
      "Google reported last month on its X account, formerly Twitter, that it maintains a \u201clong-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\u201d",
      "An Associated Press analysis shows that as of Thursday, the user's location and other data was dependent on how the Gulf appeared on Google Maps. If the user is in the United States, the body of water appeared as Gulf of America. If the user was physically in Mexico, it would appear as the Gulf of Mexico. In many other countries across the world it appears as \u201cGulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name Gulf of Mexico, saying its use dates to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "She has also mentioned that, according to the constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n, the antecedent to Mexico\u2019s first constitution, the North American territory was previously identified as \u201cMexican America\u201d. Sheinbaum has used the example to poke fun at Trump and underscore the international implications of changing the Gulf's name.",
      "In that sense, Sheinbaum said on Thursday that the Mexican government would ask Google to make \u201cMexican America\u201d pop up on the map when searched.",
      "This is not the first time Mexicans and Americans have disagreed on the names of key geographic areas, such as the border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas. Mexico calls it Rio Bravo and for the United States it is the Rio Grande.",
      "This week, the White House barred AP reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency's policy on the name. AP is using \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d but also acknowledging Trump's renaming of it as well, to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world."

    "summary": "Meteorologists warn that the coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy and prolonged exclamation point on America&rsquo;s winter of repeated polar vortex invasions starting this weekend",
    "story": [
      "Meteorologists warn that the coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy and prolonged exclamation point on America\u2019s winter of repeated polar vortex invasions starting this weekend",
      "The coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy exclamation point on America's winter of repeated polar vortex invasions, meteorologists warn. And it will stay frozen there all next week.",
      "Different weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole not just into the United States, but also Europe, several meteorologists tell The Associated Press.",
      "This will be the 10th time this winter that the polar vortex \u2014 which keeps the coldest of Arctic air penned in at the top of the world \u2014 stretches like a rubber band to send some of that big chill south, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. In a normal winter, it happens maybe two or three times.",
      "This winter, with record snow in New Orleans and drought and destructive wildfires in Southern California, has not been normal.",
      "The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains Saturday and then stick around all next week. The cold will likely concentrate east of the Rockies with only the far American west and central and southern Florida exempted, meteorologists said.",
      "On Tuesday, expect the Lower 48 states to have an average low of 16.6 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 Celsius), and then plunge to 14 degrees (minus 10 Celsius) on Wednesday, calculated private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Meteorologists expect strong winds to make the cold feel even worse. Every U.S. state but Hawaii, California and Florida have some or all parts forecast to have a good chance of windchills of 20 degrees or below sometime next week, the National Weather Service predicted.",
      "Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa will have \u201cprobably the most impressive\u201d cold, with temperatures as much as 35 degrees (19 degrees Celsius) below what's normal for this time of year, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center. NOAA weather models predict Wednesday lows below zero in Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.",
      "Some storms \u2014 with flooding, heavy snow or even a nor'easter \u2014 could hit during next week's prolonged cold outbreak, but details on those aren't certain yet, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cEverything, all the stars align, all the wind directions in the atmosphere are dragging the cold polar air out of the Canadian Arctic,\u201d Maue said. \u201cIt\u2019s the depths of winter. Everything signals extreme biting, winter cold. Obviously this isn\u2019t the first polar vortex episode of the winter, but it looks to be the most severe.\u201d",
      "A stretched polar vortex like this one happens lower in the atmosphere and is different than when the polar vortex has sudden warming, weakens and all the cold air escapes south and out of the poles, Cohen said. During stretching events, the polar vortex remains in place and strong, but it also just pulls and bends. Stretch outbreaks are usually slightly milder than the big polar escape events and often hit the United States, not Europe.",
      "Meteorologists are going to want to study why this stretching is happening so often this year, but it could just be natural randomness, said Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center who specializes in the polar vortex.",
      "\u201cWhat we're observing right now is interesting, but not unprecedented,\u201d said Martin Stendel, a scientist at the National Center for Climate Research in Denmark.",
      "Another factor adding to the polar vortex stretching is a big blob of high pressure in the upper atmosphere over Greenland. It's moving west and will push the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems such as storms \u2014 into a pattern that causes polar air to plunge and stay there, Cohen said.",
      "Human-caused climate change may be making the jet stream wavier and more likely to be stuck in that wavy pattern, one of the factors involved, Stendel said.",
      "There haven't been many winters like this in the past to help meteorologists forecast what will happen next and when the cold will finally go away, Maue said.",
      "Despite the unusually cold winter across the U.S., the world remains in an overall warming pattern. Earth's average overall temperature set yet another monthly heat record in January. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial times.",

      "A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration passive acoustic recorder located about 900 miles (1,448 kilometers) away from the implosion site picked up the sound, U.S. Coast Guard officials said in a statement. The recording became public on Feb. 7.",
      "The brief, staticky recording includes a loud noise that sounds somewhat like an underwater thunderclap. It then goes silent for its remaining few seconds.",

The Titan vanished on its way to the wreck of the Titanic in the North Atlantic Ocean, setting off a five-day search that ended with authorities telling the world that the vessel had been destroyed with no survivors.",

      "Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at Ukraine\u2019s rare earth industry and how a deal might come together:",
      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",
      "\u201cIt can be lithium. It can be titanium, uranium, many others,\u201d Yermak said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot.\u201d",
      "China, Trump\u2019s chief geopolitical adversary, is the world\u2019s largest producer of rare earth elements. Both the U.S and Europe have sought to reduce their dependence on Beijing.",
      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",

      "The summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to debate AI\u2019s impact on security, economics, and governance.",
      "The differences were openly displayed at the summit: Europe seeks to regulate and invest, China expands access through state-backed tech giants, and the U.S., under President Donald Trump, champions a hands-off approach.",
      "Among the high-profile attendees is Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, reflecting Beijing\u2019s interest in shaping global AI standards.",
      "Vance has been an outspoken critic of European content moderation policies. He has suggested the U.S. should reconsider its NATO commitments if European governments impose restrictions on Elon Musk\u2019s social media platform, X. His Paris visit is also expected to include candid discussions on Ukraine, AI\u2019s role in global power shifts, and U.S.-China tensions.",

      "\"I think one day we will have to find ways to control AI or else we will lose control of everything,\u201d said Admiral Pierre Vandier, NATO\u2019s commander who oversees the alliance\u2019s modernization efforts.",

      "Analysts see this as an opportunity to counterbalance the dominance of private companies in AI development. However, it remains unclear whether the U.S. will support such efforts.",

      "A group of investors led by Musk \u2014 who now heads Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 has made a $97.4 billion bid to acquire the nonprofit behind OpenAI. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, attending the Paris summit, swiftly rejected the offer on X.",

      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 The Italian government denied Wednesday that it had spied on journalists and migrant activists using spyware but said it would cooperate with an investigation into \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d after at least seven Italian cellphones were apparently hacked with military-grade surveillance technology.",
      "Meta\u2019s WhatsApp messaging service informed dozens of people across the European Union on Jan. 31 that they had been targeted in a spyware attack using technology from Israeli cyber firm Paragon Solutions.",
      "In a statement provided by Meta\u2019s Italy press office, WhatsApp said it had disrupted what it called \u201ca spyware campaign by Paragon that targeted several users, including journalists and members of civil society.\u201d",
      "After The Guardian newspaper reported the story, the Italian government confirmed on Feb. 5 that at least seven Italian cellphones were involved and that it had activated the National Cybersecurity Agency, which reports to the premier\u2019s office, to investigate.",
      "It said other targeted phones had numbers from Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.",
      "Speaking to parliament\u2019s lower chamber Wednesday, Cabinet Minister Luca Ciriani confirmed that the Italian government for many years has had a contract with Paragon Solutions to provide intelligence-gathering capabilities to fight terrorism and other threats to national security.",
      "But he insisted that the law was \u201crigorously respected\u201d and denied the government had used the technology to spy on journalists illegally. He threatened legal action against any claims to the contrary.",
      "\u201cRegardless, it\u2019s up to judicial authorities to ascertain the source of the vulnerabilities that have been claimed,\u201d he said, adding that Italian intelligence services \u201care ready to provide full support.\u201d",
      "The Guardian has reported that Paragon halted its contract with Italy after the spyware attack became public, but Ciriani said the contract with the intelligence services continues. That suggests that a second contract, perhaps with another law enforcement agency or police department, was canceled. Israel\u2019s Haaretz newspaper has said Paragon had two contracts with Italy for Graphite, a military-grade surveillance technology capable of hacking into encrypted smartphones.",
      "There was no immediate response to an email seeking comment sent to Paragon Solutions.",
      "Among the Italians targeted were Luca Casarini, the head of the migrant rescue group Mediterranea Saving Humans, and Francesco Cancellato, editor of the Fanpage new website, both of whose work has been critical of the government.",
      "Both confirmed in interviews Wednesday that they had been informed by WhatsApp on Jan. 31 that their phones had been infected with the spyware. The message they received from WhatsApp suggested they contact Citizen Lab, based out of the Munk School at the University of Toronto, which has for years played a leading role in exposing state-backed hackers.",
      "Cancellato said he believed he had been targeted by hackers who wanted to see what investigative stories Fanpage was developing. He declined to speculate on who it might have been. Fanpage has published undercover reports in which journalists infiltrated the youth branch of Premier Giorgia Meloni's party and exposed neofascist behavior.",
      "Casarini, for his part, heads an aid group that rescues migrants in the Mediterranean and has criticized the Italian government's support of Libya's patrols of its coasts to prevent smugglers\u2019 boats from leaving."

      "NEW YORK -- Google's online calendar has removed default references for a handful of holidays and cultural events \u2014 with users noticing that mentions of Pride and Black History Month, as well as other observances, no longer appear in their desktop and mobile applications.",
      "The omissions gained attention online over the last week, particularly around upcoming events that are no longer automatically listed. But Google says it made the change midway through last year.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\u201d for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\u201cMaintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn\u2019t scalable or sustainable,\u201d Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\u201d",
      "Google did not provide a full list of the cultural events it added prior to last year's change \u2014 and therefore no longer appear by default today.",
      "But social media users and product experts posting to online community boards have pointed to several holidays and cultural observances that they're not seeing anymore. In addition to the first days of Pride Month and Black History Month, that includes the start of Indigenous Peoples Month and Hispanic Heritage Month, as well as Holocaust Remembrance Day. The Verge first reported on some of these omissions last week.",
      "Norway-based Time and Date AS, which operates timeanddate.com, did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. The website shows numerous country-by-country lists of holidays and observances from around the world \u2014 some of which include cultural awareness events like Pride and Black History Month \u2014 but those specific to public holidays are more limited.",
      "Separate from this Calendar shift, Google has also gained attention over its more recent decision to change the names of the Gulf of Mexico and Denali on Google Maps \u2014 following orders from President Donald Trump to rename the body of water bordering the U.S., Mexico and Cuba the Gulf of America, as well as revert the title of America\u2019s highest mountain peak back to Mt. McKinley.",
      "\u201cWe have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources,\u201d Google said last month. The company added that its maps will reflect any updates to the Geographic Names Information System, a database of more than 1 million geographic features in the U.S.",
      "Google confirmed Monday that the Gulf of America name had gone into effect. Google Maps users in the U.S. now only see the Gulf of America name, whereas those in other countries see both names. Denali, however, still appears on both Google Maps and the GNIS.",
      "And the new names on Google Maps aren't the only change the company has made following recent actions from the Trump administration. Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Google's move notably came in the wake of an executive order aimed, in part, at pressuring government contractors to end DEI initiatives. As a federal contractor, Google said it was evaluating required changes.",
      "By Tuesday, both Apple and Microsoft\u2019s Bing made the switch from Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America on their maps."

      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman\u2019s push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company",
      "PARIS -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.",
      "\"We are not for sale,\u201d Altman said Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.",
      "Musk\u2019s bid, announced Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a nonprofit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.",
      "\u201cOpenAI has a mission,\u201d Altman told France\u2019s AI minister in an on-stage discussion Tuesday mobbed by tech industry workers and investors. \u201cWe are an unusual organization and we have this mission of making AGI benefit all humanity. And we are here to do that.\u201d",
      "Its stated aim since its founding in 2015 is to safely build futuristic, better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk, an early investor and board member, quit OpenAI in 2018 after an internal power struggle left Altman in charge.",
      "Their public feud has escalated over the past year as Musk sued OpenAI and is working to grow his own AI company called xAI, part of a business empire that includes Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X. Musk also now holds power as a top adviser to President Donald Trump in reshaping the U.S. government, and has publicly questioned OpenAI\u2019s Trump-backed private investment project for building AI data centers in the United States.",
      "The offer complicates OpenAI's plan to shift its structure away from its nonprofit roots to a company beholden to shareholders.",
      "OpenAI's nonprofit board will need to consider Musk's offer. It's not Altman alone who can accept or reject it, though the chair of the board, Bret Taylor, echoed Altman's approach and declared \u201cOpenAI is not for sale\u201d at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday in Palo Alto, California.",
      "Taylor said Musk's move was \u201clargely a distraction\u201d from the board's fiduciary duty to its mission.",
      "As a nonprofit board, said Taylor, \u201cour job is very simple, which is to basically evaluate every strategic decision of the organization through that one test, which is, \u2018Does this actually further the mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity?\u2019 And I have a hard time seeing how this would.\u201d",
      "The board will need to weigh not just the value of the company's assets but also the value of controlling the company developing this technology. Musk's offer also seems to set a floor for how much the nonprofit should be paid if it does relinquish control of its subsidiaries.",
      "Rose Chan Loui, executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law, said the board should consider the credibility of Musk's offer, including if he and his investors will pay in cash. And they should consider whether a new board under the control of Musk and other investors would be independent and what guarantees they can give about protecting its public mission.",
      "Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover in 2022 also started with an unsolicited offer and a legal fight with Twitter's board, which was also led by Taylor, a former Facebook and Salesforce executive. However, taking over OpenAI would be more complicated because of its charitable purpose.",
      "\u201cThere is a legally binding purpose,\u201d said Jill Horwitz, a professor at UCLA School of Law. \u201cIt is the promise that was made to the public when OpenAI, the nonprofit, was formed. That promise is legally enforceable.\u201d",
      "The sudden popularity of ChatGPT two years ago brought worldwide fame and new commercial possibilities to OpenAI and also heightened internal turmoil over the future of the organization and the advanced AI it was trying to develop. Its nonprofit board fired Altman in late 2023. He came back days later with a new board.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit purpose, as defined most recently in 2020, is \u201c(to) ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, including by conducting and/or funding artificial intelligence research.\u201d",
      "The question is, can it do that if it sells its assets and loses control of the company developing this technology?",
      "\u201cTo make the promise to the world that you are bound by a legal purpose and to build with that promise, including telling your investors not to expect any returns and to think of your investments as more akin to a donation than an investment,\" said Horwitz. \"And then to say once you\u2019ve gotten big enough, \u2019You know what? We\u2019d like to own this.' That seems like a real violation of the promise.\u201d",
      "Musk sued OpenAI last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab that would benefit the public good. A lawyer for Musk has said he invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018.",
      "Lawyers for OpenAI and Musk faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed Musk\u2019s request for a court order that would block OpenAI's for-profit conversion.",
      "The judge hasn\u2019t yet ruled on Musk\u2019s request but in the courtroom said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn\u2019t intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its planned transition. But she also suggested Musk had plausible enough arguments to take to a jury trial.",
      "Along with Musk and xAI, others backing the bid announced Monday include Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund, and firms run by Musk allies Ari Emanuel and Jon Lonsdale.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement that if Altman and OpenAI\u2019s current board \u201care intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time.\u201d",
      "Altman told employees this week that OpenAI's structure \u201censures that no individual can take control of OpenAI\u201d and he has sought to characterize Musk's tactics as those of a competitor trying to catch up.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s probably just trying to slow us down. He obviously is a competitor,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg TV at the Paris summit on Tuesday.",
      "Continuing their deeply personal feud, Altman said Musk is probably not a \u201chappy person.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying numerous investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles.",
      "Now, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish within weeks or months.",
      "On the potential chopping block: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.",
      "The consequences of such actions could prove dire, say safety advocates who credit the federal investigations and recalls with saving lives.",
      "\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d",
      "Within days of Trump taking office, the White House and Musk began waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.",
      "The actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.",
      "Investigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.",
      "As such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.",
      "Among Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.",
      "A host of Musk's other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.",
      "Musk\u2019s businesses are also intertwined with the federal government, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.",
      "Those donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.",
      "As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.",
      "Even before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump's election.",
      "\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.",
      "The action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.",
      "The transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.",
      "\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.",
      "Auto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Before the election, he posted a message on X, saying he had never asked Trump \u201cfor any favors, nor has he offered me any.\u201d",
      "Although most of the changes that Musk might seek for Tesla could unfold quickly, there is one long-term goal that could impact the autonomous vehicle industry for decades to come.",
      "Though nearly 30 states have rules that specifically govern self-driving cars, the federal government has yet to craft such regulations.",
      "During a late October call with Tesla investors, as Musk was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s campaign, he signaled support for having the federal government create these rules.",
      "\u201cThere should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cIf there\u2019s a department of government efficiency, I\u2019ll try to help make that happen.\u201d",
      "Musk leads that very organization.",
      "People whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.",
      "They say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon.",
      "The college student was on a date with her boyfriend, gazing at the stars on the side of a rural Florida road, when they were struck by an out-of-control Tesla driving on Autopilot \u2014 a system that allows Tesla cars to operate without driver input. The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.",
      "Benavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.",
      "\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon's family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d",
      "Tesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\" an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon's attorney disputes.",
      "The federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.",
      "NHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.",
      "The agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.",
      "Other federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:",
      "\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.",
      "\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.",
      "\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.",
      "\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.",
      "Experts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d",
      "Trump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.",
      "Tesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.",
      "The federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.",
      "\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d",
      "Musk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d",
      "Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.",
      "As with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.",
      "That threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d",
      "Among the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.",
      "An investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.",
      "Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.",
      "NHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.",
      "The agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.",
      "NHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.",
      "That recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.",
      "In a letter to Tesla in April, agency investigators noted that crashes involving Autopilot continue and that they could not observe a difference between warnings issued to drivers before or after the new software had been installed.",
      "Critics have said that Teslas don\u2019t have proper sensors to be fully self-driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions. Tesla, on the other hand, relies only on cameras to spot hazards.",
      "Musk has said that human drivers rely on their eyesight, so autonomous cars should be able to also get by with just cameras. He has called technology that relies on radar and light detection to discern objects a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "Bryant Walker Smith, a Stanford Law School scholar and a leading automated driving expert, said Musk\u2019s contention that the federal government is holding him back is not accurate. The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.",
      "\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d",
      "The collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.",
      "Attorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.",
      "However, Schreiber and other lawyers say if the federal government\u2019s investigative powers don\u2019t remain intact, Tesla may also not be held accountable in court.",
      "In the pending wrongful death lawsuit that Neima Benavides Leon filed against Tesla after her sister\u2019s death, her attorney told a Miami district judge the lawsuit would have likely been dropped if NHTSA hadn\u2019t investigated and found defects with the Autopilot system.",
      "\u201cAll along we were hoping that the NHTSA investigation would produce what it did, in fact, end up producing, which is a finding of product defect and a recall,\u201d attorney Doug Eaton said during a March court hearing. \u201cAnd we had told you very early on in the case if NHTSA had not found that, we may very well drop the case. But they did, in fact, find this.\u201d",

      "In addition to taking down scam networks, Meta says it is testing other tools to combat bad actors, including facial recognition technology that compares suspicious users' profile photos against a public figure's image. But, for now, that only works for celebrity impersonations.",

      "The unusual sighting, captured last year on a video camera set up by SAVE Wildlife Conservation Fund Poland project coordinator Joanna Toczyd\u0142owska, has prompted the organization to collect scat (droppings) in the forest in the hopes of learning more about the black wolves' genetics.",
      "\u201cIt's something new and unusual,\u201d Toczyd\u0142owska told The Associated Press.",
      "Toczyd\u0142owska initially placed the camera to study beavers. When she noticed she was recording wolves instead, she kept the camera there and collected the black wolf footage a few weeks ago.",

      "Most of the 2,5000 to 3,000 wolves in Poland are gray with red or black accents. Black fur comes from a genetic mutation that was likely in domesticated dogs thousands of years ago. The dark fur is rare in Europe due to a reduced genetic diversity, but at least half of the wolf population has black fur in Yellowstone National Park in the United States.",
      "Because wolves travel in families and both black wolves were around 30 kilograms (66 lbs) \u2014 roughly the size of a German shepherd \u2014 Toczyd\u0142owska said they were likely siblings and roughly a year old. At least one is male.",

The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",

      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:06:26 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t work&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t last very long",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don't last very long. Instead he wants the government to exclusively move to plastic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous situation. We\u2019re going back to plastic straws,\u201d Trump said as he signed an executive order to reverse federal purchasing policies that encourage paper straws and restrict plastic ones. The order directs federal agencies to stop buying paper straws \u201cand otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.\u201d",
      "The move by Trump \u2014 who has long railed against paper straws, and whose 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws for $15 per pack of 10 \u2014 targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.",
      "Trump declared President Joe Biden\u2019s policy \u201cDEAD!\u201d in a social media post over the weekend.",
      "While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said Monday that he thinks \"it's OK\u201d to continue using them. \u201cI don\u2019t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they\u2019re eating, as they\u2019re munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.",
      "Several U.S. states and cities have banned plastic straws, and some restaurants no longer automatically give them to customers. But plastic straws are only a small part of the problem. The environment is littered with single-use plastic food and beverage containers \u2014 water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, shopping bags and more.",
      "Around the world, the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic enters the ocean every minute from a range of sources, including plastic bags, toothbrushes, bottles, food packaging and more, experts say. As those materials break down in the environment, microplastics are turning up in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals, as well as in human blood and tissue.",
      "And plastic manufacturing releases planet-warming greenhouse gases and other dangerous pollutants. More than 90% of plastic products are derived from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and millions of tons of plastic waste enter the world\u2019s oceans every year. Many multinational companies have moved away from plastic straws and have made reducing plastic use across their operations central to their sustainability goals, making Trump's decision an outlier in the business world.",
      "Trump\u2019s order is \u201cmore about messaging than finding solutions,\u2033 said Christy Leavitt, plastics campaign director for the environmental group Oceana, noting that most U.S. voters support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic packaging and foodware.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is moving in the wrong direction on single-use plastics,'' Leavitt said. \u201cThe world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today.\u201d",
      "The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.",
      "\u201cStraws are just the beginning,\u201d Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Back to Plastic\u2019 is a movement we should all get behind.\u201d",
      "More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network. Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.",
      "\"To prevent another sea turtle from becoming a victim to plastic, we must make personal lifestyle alterations to fight for these species,'' the group said in a statement.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.",
      "Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea late last year but didn\u2019t reach an agreement. Talks resume this year as more than 100 countries pursue a pact that limits plastic production as well as tackles cleanup and recycling.",
      "The U.S., China and Germany are the biggest players in the global plastics trade. U.S. manufacturers have asked Trump to remain at the negotiating table, and to revert to Biden\u2019s previous position that focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse.",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who presented the executive order to Trump, told him the push for paper straws has cost the government and private industry \u201can absolute ton of money and left consumers all over the country wildly dissatisfied with their straws. It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives.\"",

      "Detroit high school teacher Rodney Fresh said he's seen students that might have been considered \"a throwaway child by society \u2026 become a productive member of society when they graduate\" because of the Michigan school's career and technical programs, which get federal funding.",
      "\"I've seen students where traditional schooling hasn't necessarily been beneficial, but we get them in supportive career tech programs that are supported by federal finances, and they excel. They find their niche,\" Fresh told ABC News.",
      "Established in 1980 by Congress, the department is intended to collect data and research on schooling and education, direct supportive funds to targeted communities, and investigate and enforce civil rights anti-discrimination law. It's the smallest Cabinet-level department, with less than 5,000 employees.",
      "The department does not dictate or implement policy on school curriculum.",
      "President Trump said he wants to eliminate the department and \"send all education work and needs back to the States,\" according to Trump's Agenda47 campaign.",
      "Trump's team hasn't clarified what it would mean to give the power back to the states, though he has cited the use of \"block grants\" by the federal government as a way to further expand school voucher programs.",
      "In the ongoing efforts to dismantle the Department of Education, lawmakers have recommended redirecting program enforcement and funds to other federal departments.",
      "\"The federal Department of Education has never educated a single student, and it's long past time to end this bureaucratic Department that causes more harm than good,\" U.S. Senator Mike Rounds said when introducing legislation to dismantle the department.",
      "A statement from his office continued, stating: \"Despite its inefficiencies, there are several important programs housed within the Department. Rounds' legislation would redirect these to Departments of Interior, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Labor and State.\"",
      "ABC News has reached out to the White House and the Department of Education for comment.",
      "\"Many of the concerns that people have with education and the direction of education this country, whether it be curriculum, instruction or even instructional materials, are not handled by the Department of Education,\" Rep. Jahana Hayes, a Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, said in an interview with ABC News.",
      "\"Those are already local decisions that are handled by local boards of education, state boards of education. So all of that is handled locally.\"",
      "Federal funding makes up 11% of school revenue nationwide, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.",
      "However, the weight this funding carries is heavier for some states than others; federal dollars make up roughly 20% of South Dakota school revenue and 19% of revenue in Mississippi and Montana. These are the biggest recipients of federal dollars in the country, the NCES noted.",
      "States like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are among the smallest recipients, with federal dollars making up just 5% of school revenue.",
      "Among the grants and funds delivered by the department are Title I funding and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding. These federal financial assistance programs are geared towards communities facing high levels of poverty or disabled populations. They can support services like additional reading and mathematics instruction and staffing, speech or behavioral therapy, after-school and summer programs.",
      "Across Ohio, the state's Coalition for the Education of Children with Disabilities reports that almost 16% of students have a disability of some kind.",
      "Stambaugh said she sees the role that federal funding plays for the disabled students in her classrooms each day. She noted the money subsidizes the salaries or pay for tutors, individual aids for highly disabled children and intervention specialists aimed at helping struggling readers and performers.",
      "Getting rid of federal funding, Stambaugh argued, \"gives our highest vulnerability students less one-on-one attention, less individualized education, and it puts them at greater risk to be even further behind the peers that they're already testing behind.\"",
      "In Detroit, where about 84% of kids are eligible for free and/or reduced-price lunch, schools have become more than a place for students to learn.",
      "For those who come to school hungry, need a place to wash and dry their clothes, or need additional help with literacy and math after class, federal funding helps schools run additional services for students in need, according to Fresh.",
      "\"For some students, I become a counselor, a social worker, a big brother, a dad, and so I don't think you ever really get to just turn off from being a teacher,\" said Fresh. \"I think it's a 24/7 job.\"",
      "Title I and IDEA were established through Congress, just as the Department of Education was, and it would take Congress to lead their undoing, some lawmakers told ABC News.",
      "Hayes told ABC News that she expects Trump and billionaire businessman and Trump confidant Elon Musk to \"strangle the funding\" of the department if it can't be dismantled.",
      "\"What we're seeing through some of the actions with other organizations is that we are dealing with an administration that is not following the rules as they've been established,\" Hayes said. \"The Department of Education was set up by an act of Congress, and can only be dismantled by an act of Congress.\"",
      "Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has already made sizable cuts to the Education Department \u2013 slashing 89 independent research contracts at the department's Institute of Education Sciences worth nearly $900 million, according to DOGE's post on X and confirmed by a department spokesperson on Feb. 11.",
      "But with the thin Republican majority in the House and Senate, it's unclear just how likely it would be for Congress to dismantle the department completely.",
      "Utah Republican Rep. Burgess Owens told ABC News it'll be a congressional numbers game to take down the Education Department, but noted that he has to \"see if executive order can really do that or not.\"",
      "\"All the things will be tested,\" he said.",
      "Owens, who supports dismantling the department, said that issuing block grants to states could serve as a replacement for the department's programs, adding that there would have to be some state accountability for funds.",
      "\"If this is not working, let's be innovative. Let's be creative, and we figure out something else,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Democratic senators want more details on the costs and impact of the border mission and migrant detentions at Guantanamo.",
    "story": [
      "The Pentagon has given no cost estimates for the border mission and Guantanamo.",
      "After senior U.S. military officials told Congress they do not know yet how much the surge of active-duty military forces to the southern border with Mexico and the buildup of infrastructure to house thousands of migrants at Guantanamo might end up costing, two Democratic senators on Friday requested more details from the Pentagon.",
      "Following a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Thursday with the commanders of U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Southern Command, Sens. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., sent a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth requesting specific details by Feb. 27 regarding the costs, impact on readiness and impact on morale that would result from the new missions along the border and at Guantanamo.",
      "\"We are concerned about the Department of Defense's (DoD) immigration-related operations at the southern border and at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay -- including the implications of these operations for the military's budget, readiness, and morale,\" the senators said in the lengthy letter requesting specific details from the Pentagon.",
      "\"DoD's support for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been expensive for American taxpayers, with some DoD expenses costing over three times more than when DHS performs the same function, while also posing \"an unacceptable risk\" to units' readiness,\" they wrote.",
      "\"In all, the Trump administration is militarizing the country's immigration enforcement system in an apparent attempt to signal toughness,\" they added. \" But this political stunt will come at a high cost; it risks diverting DoD's resources away from its vital mission in ways that compromise our national security.\"",
      "At Thursday's hearing, Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM, and Adm. Alvin Holsey, the commander of SOUTHCOM, were asked about the potential impact on training and readiness for the forces sent to the border and what the financial costs were for the surge as well as the construction of migrant housing at the naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba.",
      "Guillot told the committee that the number of active-duty forces now on the Southern border with Mexico had risen to 5,000 and said he expected the number to continue to rise.",
      "Included in the 5,000 are the additional troops deployed to join the 2,500 federalized National Guardsmen and reservists who had been serving as part of a border mission established by the Trump administration in 2018.",
      "Meanwhile, the most recent deployment to the border took place this week as 500 Army soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division from Fort Drum, New York, arrived at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, to establish a coordinating headquarters for the border mission. An additional 1,000 troops from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, are awaiting orders to deploy to the border in support of that unit, according to a U.S. official.",
      "Asked about potential costs for the operation on the border, Guillot explained that his command has \"not appropriated funds for the Southwest border, and we've never had reprogramming or pass through funding. This is all done through the Department Comptroller and the services.\"",
      "The NORTHCOM commander also told the committee that he did not believe that the cycling of troops to the southern border would impact any scheduled training exercises being held by his command though he noted there might be a reduction in the one day of weekly training provided to deployed forces conducting jobs outside of their normal specialized roles.",
      "\"I think that specifically in the helicopters and in our intel specialties that are conducting missions on the southern border, those are exactly in line with their trained specialty,\" said Guillot. \"However, there are, I certainly recognize there are areas where they are cross-trained and they are not getting immediate benefit to their primary specialty in about half of those roles.\"",
      "At the naval base at Guantanamo, 500 Marines have been deployed to erect tents and facilities that could potentially house as many as 30,000 migrants while they await processing to be returned to their home countries.",
      "Adm. Holsey described the new construction at Guantanamo as a \"phased\" approach currently targeting housing for up to 2,500 migrants and said the potential expansion to 30,000 migrants would depend on the Department of Homeland Security's flow of migrants to the base.",
      "\"We're going to build it up and as we understand how large we'll get, we'll have a better focus on the price,\" said Holey when asked how much those operations could end up costing.",
      "He added that the Department of Homeland Security is providing security for the detained migrants and noted that any current military costs in expanding facilities at the base are coming from the military services' existing budgets.",
      "According to Holsey, there are currently 93 deported migrants currently housed at Guantanamo, with 63 of them being housed at the main prison facility that used to house hundreds of enemy combatants seized during the War on Terror. The remainder are all being housed in the newly expanded housing that falls under the base's Migrant Operations Center.",

      "The layoffs are initially impacting probationary employees.",
      "A day after the Trump administration ended its deferred resignation offer to the nation's two million federal government employees, the administration on Thursday began mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies in a move that is expected to impact thousands of employees, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "The layoffs, part of Trump's campaign pledge to slash the federal government, initially impacted probationary employees -- recent hires who joined the federal workforce within the last one to two years, depending on the agency, and have fewer protections.",
      "Based on the most recent data available, as of March 2024, there were approximately 150,000 federal workers -- excluding Defense Department employees -- with one year of service or less.",
      "Among the agencies experiencing layoffs were the Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of Personnel Management, the Environmental Protective Agency, the General Services Administration and the Small Business Administration.",
      "Some additional agencies were also directed to begin their layoffs Thursday, sources said.",
      "At some agencies, workers received written notice via email that they had been let go.",
      "At OPM, workers joined a call with a prerecorded message from the acting director notifying them of their firing, according to someone familiar with the call. About 200 probationary workers were on the call, sources said.",
      "\"Good afternoon, thank you for taking the time to meet with me today. This is a difficult conversation, and I want to be direct, while also ensuring that you have all the information and support that you need,\" acting OPM Director Charles Ezell told probationary employees, according to an audio recording of the call, obtained by ABC News. He told the employees they were being laid off and instructed them to \"gather your personal belongings and exit the premises.\"",
      "Ezell closed the meeting by expressing hope that those fired would \"use this as an opportunity for your next step forward.\"",
      "Prior to the layoffs, agencies had been directed by OPM, which acts as the federal government's HR agency, to compile lists of probationary employees at their agencies, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News.",
      "Officials told ABC News that more than 73,000 federal accepted the administration's buyout offer, which offered full pay and benefits until September for any federal employee who accepted the deferred resignation.",

    "story": [
      "Musk has admitted he has made some errors in his claims.",
      "President Donald Trump said he would provide details Thursday of what he and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) claim are billions of dollars of wasteful and fraudulent government spending.",
      "\"I'm going to read to you some of the names that hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars have been given to,\" the president said in a news conference Wednesday.",
      "But the president had not produced his list as of Thursday evening.",
      "In the weeks since Trump's inauguration, he and Musk have made claims from the Oval Office and on social media about specific programs such as disaster relief for states, lodging for migrants in cities and that 150-year-olds are receiving Social Security payments. However, what few details were provided were vague, unsupported and sometimes false.",
      "In fact, Musk admitted Tuesday that some of its claims might be \"incorrect.\"",
      "During his first news conference since starting DOGE, Musk backtracked on a claim that $50 million was spent by the federal government to give condoms to Gaza and Hamas. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt first made that claim at a White House briefing last month and was spread wide by Trump, Musk and Republican lawmakers.",
      "In fact, the condoms were sent to a province in Mozambique named Gaza as part of an HIV prevention measure.",
      "\"Some of the things I say may be incorrect and should be corrected. Nobody's batting 1.000,\" Musk told reporters in the Oval Office. \"We all make mistakes, but we'll act to quickly correct any mistakes.\"",
      "Musk claimed that he and DOGE have been \"fully public\" with \"all of our actions,\" but much of DOGE's activity across numerous federal agencies has been learned through reporting, reaction from government employees affected by DOGE's actions, or when DOGE and agency heads shut down government offices and sent employees home.",
      "The updates that DOGE and Musk provide on his X social media platform are often vague and often don't contain documentation.",
      "On Thursday, the billionaire reposted to his 217.5 million followers on X a claim that Reuters was awarded $9 million by the Department of Defense for a \"social engineering\" program and called it a \"scam.\" Trump passed the claim along on his Truth Social platform, posting \"GIVE BACK THE MONEY NOW!\"",
      "However, public records show the contract was awarded in 2018, during Trump's first term, to Thompson Reuters Special Services division, not its news organization, following a request from the previous year from a Department of Defense agency for research on \"automated defense social engineering attacks.\"",
      "Washington Post tech reporter Drew Harwell was one of the first to point out the specifics of the Reuters contracts Thursday morning in Bluesky posts.",
      "Musk promised DOGE would use \"maximum transparency\" in its actions, even before Trump was elected in November. He said it would do weekly \"DOGE casts\" on X and update its Doge.gov website with its activity.",
      "At the time of Tuesday's Oval Office news conference when Musk was asked about transparency, the site showed only a logo and a slogan, but a day later, it was populated with posts from the DOGE X account, a regulations page that featured a bar graph of \"agency rules created by unelected bureaucrats\" and a \"workforce\" page that listed headcount for federal workers.",
      "The website cites its \"sources\" as largely publicly available OPM data.",
      "The bottom of the page features the following notice by DOGE acknowledging \"there are likely some errors or omissions. We will continue to strive for maximum accuracy over time.\"",
      "When asked Tuesday to talk about the specifics of the fraud he found, Musk alleged there were people receiving Social Security benefits who were 150 years old. Musk did not provide any more details or specifics on how he found these people's Social Security information.",
      "Despite Musk's companies SpaceX and Tesla being awarded at least $18 billion in federal contracts over the past decade and SpaceX winning more than $17 million worth of contracts since 2015, Musk did not squarely address his potential conflicts of interest with the government on Tuesday.",
      "On Wednesday, a procurement forecast document released by the State Department said Musk's Telsa is forecast to win a $400 million contract to provide \"armored Teslas\" to the State Department later this year.",
      "The contract, which was modified in December and scheduled to be awarded in September, is expected to last for five years, according to the procurement forecast document. However, the agency the next day updated its procurement forecast document, simply describing the procurement requirement as \"armored electric vehicles\" instead.",
      "Asked by ABC News' Rachel Scott if there were checks and balances in place to ensure that Musk's companies aren't benefitting from his access, he said that all of DOGE's actions are \"fully public.\"",
      "\"So, if you see anything you say like, 'Wait a second. Hey, you know what that does? That seems like maybe that's, you know, that there's a conflict there,'\" Musk said. \"It\u2019s not like people are going to be shy about saying that. They'll say it immediately.\"",
      "Musk did not elaborate on where such a complaint would be publicized or whether he would publicly acknowledge it.",
      "He said that DOGE's transparency will build trust.",
      "\"And then you can see, am I doing something that benefits one of my companies or not? It's totally obvious,\" he said.",

      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk met during Modi's visit to the U.S., where he spoke with Trump about trade and tariff concerns",
      "NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk during his visit to the U.S. to meet President Donald Trump. The exact nature of the meeting is unclear, although Modi said on X that the two men \u201cdiscussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology and innovation.\u201d",
      "Musk was recently chosen by Trump to head a new U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "Modi and Musk also met each other in New York in 2023. At that time Musk said he was \u201cconfident that Tesla will be in India ... as soon as humanly possible.\u201d",
      "Modi and Musk met each other on Thursday during the Indian prime minister\u2019s visit to the U.S. While Musk was accompanied by his three young children, Modi was notably flanked by his top advisers \u2014 including External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.",
      "Later, at a joint press conference with Modi at the White House, Trump said he wasn\u2019t sure why Musk met the Indian prime minister but he assumed Musk \"wants to do business in India.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would imagine he met, possibly, because you know he\u2019s running a company,\u201d Trump told reporters.",
      "India\u2019s foreign ministry in a statement said Modi and Musk \u201cdiscussed strengthening collaboration between Indian and U.S. entities in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence and sustainable development\u201d and on \u201centrepreneurship and good governance.\u201d",
      "Musk, who previously called himself a \u201cfan of Modi,\" has long wanted his Starlink satellite internet service to make an entry into the Indian market. Its launch, however, has been delayed due to regulatory challenges, security concerns and opposition from domestic telecom giants like Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio.",
      "Last November, India\u2019s telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink was yet to comply with security norms, and a license for satellite communications services will be issued only after the company meets all the requirements.",
      "Musk had earlier criticized India's policy of granting spectrum for satellite services through auctioning. The Indian government later changed the policy and said it will assign satellite spectrum and not auction it.",
      "India\u2019s satellite broadband service market is highly competitive. At least six companies control the market, led by Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio.",
      "Apart from regulatory roadblocks, Musk's Starlink has also faced resistance by Reliance Jio, which last year said granting spectrum for satellite services through auctioning is necessary to ensure fair competition.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink has at least 6,900 active satellites orbiting Earth that provide low-latency broadband to some 4.6 million people. But if Musk wants to enter the Indian market, Starlink's high pricing could be a concern.",
      "Mobile data in India is among the cheapest globally, and Ambani's Jio once gave data for free on its mobile plans. And yet, at least 40% of the country\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people still don\u2019t have access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous areas.",
      "Musk\u2019s Tesla has also been waiting to get into India, which is one of the world\u2019s largest automobile markets, but has faced hurdles due to high import duties on vehicles brought into the country.",
      "Also, India\u2019s electric vehicle market is still nascent and made up a little more than 2% of total car sales last year. But the government wants to change that and increase the electric vehicle share to 30% by 2030.",
      "India also recently unveiled a new policy that extends concessional tariffs on fully imported electric vehicles made by foreign carmakers who commit to starting local manufacturing.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:17:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite Donald Trump continuing to push for the forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, he is facing significant pushback from allies and states in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Arab states have openly rejected Trump's proposal to force out Palestinians.",
      "Despite President Donald Trump's push for the forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza -- a move that, if carried out, would be a violation of international law that some experts and U.S. allies have called ethnic cleansing -- he is facing significant pushback from allies and states in the region.",
      "There is \"zero possibility\" that Palestinians will be forcibly displaced from Gaza and into Jordan and Egypt, one expert told ABC News.",
      "\"I see no scenario where this happens,\" Brian Katulis, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Middle East Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told ABC News. \"This is their home. They've endured so much to stay in their home, even if their home -- literal homes, family homes -- have been destroyed.\"",
      "\"It's a model that just won't work in today's Middle East,\" Katulis said, referring to the forced displacement of Palestinians.",
      "\"The risk is that [this] comes at a very uncertain time with the ceasefire and hostage release deal on thin ice, and it actually serves to distract from the important work of trying to keep that process moving forward -- to get hostages released and much-needed aid into the people ... and to actually try to move forward to something that is realistic,\" Katulis said.",
      "Trump at one point threatened to withdraw aid to Egypt and Jordan if they didn't agree to take in Palestinians, though less than 24 hours later, he said, \"I don't\u00a0have to threaten\u00a0that, I don't\u00a0think. I think we're\u00a0above that.\"",
      "\"The point of this is to ostensibly force Egypt and Jordan to accept all of the Palestinians currently living in the Gaza Strip, so they can engage, so the U.S. can annex the territory. I think it's safe to say it's a non-starter for the Saudis,\" Daniel Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts University's Fletcher School, told ABC News.",
      "\"The Jordanians, in particular, need the money. They're not oil rich, and same with Egypt, but in some ways the expectation would be that if Trump actually threatened to cut them off, they would likely turn first to Saudi Arabia and the Emiratis,\" Drezner said.",
      "Arab nations quickly rejected Trump's proposal to forcibly displace Palestinians and relocate them in neighboring states, with several calling it a hard line.",
      "\"The Foreign Ministry affirms that Saudi Arabia's position on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering. HRH Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Crown Prince and Prime Minister clearly and unequivocally reaffirmed this stance,\" Saudi Arabia said last week, just hours after Trump called for the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza.",
      "As much as a bind Jordan is in, it is unlikely that it would accept anything along the lines of what Trump proposed, Drezner said, adding the proposal is worse than losing the $1.5 billion in annual aid that it receives from the U.S.",
      "\"The question is the extent to which the Saudis are willing to bankroll both the Jordanians and the Egyptians,\" Drezner said.",
      "\"Pay attention to how the Gulf states are reacting to all this, because they're the ones that are simultaneously most likely to be able to resist Trump's pressures, and also it will send a regional signal to Egypt and Jordan as to what their options are,\" Drezner said.",
      "After Trump's comments, Egypt expressed its support for the legitimate and inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, calling for the need for a two-state solution and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.",
      "As Trump continued to double down on forcing out the Palestinians, Egyptian President Abdelfatah El Sisi announced he will indefinitely postpone his plan to visit Trump at the White House. According to Saudi-owned Al Arabiya News, Sisi said he won't attend any White House talks if the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza is on the agenda.",
      "\"They're probably trying to figure out how do they reposition themselves in light of Trump's incendiary remarks, because they come directly at odds with Egypt's own positions on this issue and its national security interests. And I don't think they want to be put in any sort of position to actually directly challenge Trump right now until they assess,\" Katulis said.",
      "\"[Egypt]'s security aid from the U.S. is part of a package that came out of the Israel-Egypt peace treaty. And if Trump wants to play games with that, he's actually going to undercut a lot of America's long-standing traditional security relationships in the region,\" Katulis said.",
      "Egypt also announced it plans to host a meeting with Arab states in Cairo later this month where they will discuss a counterproposal.",
      "After meeting with Trump, King Abdullah of Jordan said in a statement he \"reiterated Jordan's steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. This is the unified Arab position. Rebuilding Gaza without displacing the Palestinians and addressing the dire humanitarian situation should be the priority for all.\"",
      "Trump appeared to walk back his threat of withdrawing aid after his meeting this week with King Abdullah resulted in the news that Jordan would take in 2,000 sick Palestinian children for treatment.",
      "\"This is a replay of what we've seen with regard to threatening Canada and Mexico [with tariffs] -- it's the shining orb strategy. It turns out if you offer Trump like a pretty gaudy but not terribly significant concession, he'll back down,\" Drezner said.",
      "\"Jordan can never agree to this -- to Trump's proposal -- that would be the end of the regime. And that's the fundamental thing that I assume someone must have told Donald Trump,\" Drezner said.",
      "In addition to opposing the forced displacement of Palestinians, Jordan and Egypt also have strains on their economies and taking in millions of refugees could potentially produce more economic and security challenges.",
      "For the last 20 years, Jordan has faced an influx of refugees from Iraq and Syria, which has strained their economy and their social fabric,\u00a0according to Katulis.",
      "Egypt's economy has also faced strains, with the Egyptian pound being depreciated several times in recent years. According to the World Food Programme, from January 2016 to January 2025, the Egyptian pound was devalued by 84.5% relative to the U.S. dollar -- a move that governments use to increase its competitiveness or trade balance. And the U.S. dollar\u00a0appreciated by\u00a0543.8%\u00a0relative to the\u00a0Egyptian pound during that same time period, based on the\u00a0official\u00a0exchange rate, according to the World Food Programme.",
      "Taking in all Palestinians living in Gaza could also pull other countries into a confrontation with Israel, Drezner noted.",
      "\"There is no scenario whereby the Palestinians that are displaced are not going to want to return. Essentially, you're introducing the possibility of violent non-state actors to operate within your territory,\" Drezner said.",
      "Other international powers",
      "While Egypt and Jordan are most likely to look to Gulf states for alternate sources of aid, other international actors could also fill a gap created by the U.S. if Trump follows through on his threats.",
      "\"I'm not sure Russia is really in all that strong a position, particularly in the Middle East, since they lost their last port [when the regime fell in Syria] and we just saw what happened to Bashar Al Assad. I'm not sure that [Vladimir Putin]'s necessarily a reliable benefactor,\" Drezner said.",
      "\"It would make much more sense to make a pivot towards China, in no small part because, among other things, China actually has reasons to want to be involved in the region, given their various energy demands,\" Drezner said.",
      "But, Jordan and Egypt rely on military supplies from the U.S. and the West.",
      "\"The longer-term issue is that you can argue that the militaries in both Jordan and Egypt are a little bit stuck in that they rely primarily on U.S. weaponry. So to engage in a radical pivot means that in some ways you're also weakening your own coercive apparatus at the same time,\" Drezner said.",
      "It would take time before the militaries would be prepared to use weaponry from a different source, and weapons from another source would likely also be incompatible with their existing military stock, according to Drezner.",
      "\"It would be hard to pivot to either Russia or China as your primary arms manufacturer,\" Drezner said.",

      "No longer in charge, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been speaking his mind",
      "WASHINGTON -- No longer in charge, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been speaking his mind, the long-serving GOP leader rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s more high-profile Cabinet nominees \u2014 alone at times, among the Republicans, casting his no votes.",
      "When it came to Pete Hegseth, now the defense secretary, who faced allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive behavior toward women, McConnell said the combat veteran had \u201cfailed, as yet, to demonstrate\u201d he was ready for the job.",
      "The \u201cdesire to be a change agent is not enough,\u201d McConnell said.",
      "On Tulsi Gabbard, who was sworn in this week as director of national intelligence, he said she has displayed \u201ca history of alarming lapses in judgment,\u201d citing in particular her views toward Russia, China and the security breach by former government contractor Edward Snowden.",
      "And as Senate Republicans confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, McConnell, a survivor of childhood polio  who used a wheelchair during the vote, opposed.",
      "\u201cA record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts,\u201d the Kentucky senator said.",
      "This is McConnell unplugged, three weeks into the Trump administration, and his new role as no longer the Senate GOP leader but one of 100 senators. It is testing the strength, but also the limits, of his influence on the institution, where he has been a monumental presence for nearly 40 years.",
      "McConnell is far from an anti-Trump Republican and hardly the face of the GOP opposition to the White House. He has voted to confirm Trump\u2019s other nominees and said he expects to support Trump's agenda.",
      "But his opposition to the trio of Trump's most controversial nominees stands out. Taken together, McConnell's votes against Hegseth, Gabbard and RFK Jr. provide a window into the type of leader he intends to be outside the stately leadership office. And it shows the shifts in his power, as few other Republicans joined him, leaving him often on his own, with Democrats, unable to stop Trump's choices.",
      "\u201cMcConnell\u2019s votes on the Trump nominees reflect, at least in part, the fact that he is more free to vote in accord with personal preferences than he was when he was responsible for serving as the leader and voice for Senate Republicans,\u201d said Frances Lee, a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton.",
      "Just two other Republicans, the independent-minded Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, also voted against Hegseth.",
      "\u201cNow that he is no longer in leadership, Sen. McConnell enjoys more freedom to simply exercise his own individual judgment and personal discretion,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Trump lashed out after the latest votes, calling McConnell \u201cbitter\u201d and \u201cnot equipped mentally\u201d during a lengthy rant in the Oval Office late Thursday, after Kennedy was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cI feel sorry for Mitch,\u201d the Republican president said.",
      "\u201cHe votes against almost everything now. He\u2019s a, you know, very bitter guy,\u201d Trump said of McConnell, who had been a crucial partner as the Senate majority leader during Trump's first term.",
      "Together, Trump and McConnell passed shared priorities, notably the 2017 GOP tax bill, but the two also clashed \u2014 the president calling the senator \u201cOld Crow,\u201d which McConnell turned into a badge of honor \u2014 and had a very public falling out after the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. McConnell called Trump \u201cmorally responsible\u201d for the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection by a mob of his supporters at the Capitol but ultimately endorsed Trump's reelection bid.",
      "Trump did not appear Thursday to understand that McConnell had polio as a child, a factor as he weighed Kennedy's nomination.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s lost his power,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things.\u201d",
      "When he announced he was stepping down as GOP leader, McConnell said he would finish his Senate term, which expires after the 2026 election. It\u2019s unclear if he will run again.",
      "To be sure, McConnell is far from marginalized. He commands prime positions as chairman of the influential Rules Committee as well as the chairman of the Appropriation Committee\u2019s subcommittee on defense, where he has signaled he intends to make his mark shoring up the nation\u2019s military assets and assuring U.S. leadership on the global stage.",
      "\u201cI expect to support most of what this administration is trying to accomplish,\u201d McConnell said during a recent interview on CBS' \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d",
      "The senator still faces polio\u2019s lingering effects, particularly in his left leg. McConnell fell twice recently, on the steps from the Senate chamber, where he was swiftly caught and steadied by two GOP colleagues, and a short time later in the private GOP lunchroom. He sometimes uses a wheelchair as he did this week as a precaution.",
      "Other senators are watching and weighing the turn of events.",
      "\u201cHe seems to be liberated, and I think he\u2019s voting his conscience,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat.",
      "Blumenthal said while other Republicans are \u201cin a state of trembling in fear\u201d over primary threats if they don\u2019t fall in line with Trump\u2019s agenda, particularly from billionaire Trump aide Elon Musk\u2019s political group, McConnell is not among them.",
      "\u201cWhatever his motivation, he is certainly demonstrating that courage and conscience still matter,\u201d he said.",
      "New Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, said, \u201cThe great part about being a senator is that you get to decide what\u2019s important to you, what your priorities are, and he should represent the people who elected him.\u201d",
      "McConnell\u2019s critics have also taken notice. Nate Morris, a businessman in Kentucky, said this week he is considering a Senate run in 2026.",
      "\u201cI think President Trump needs less of these weak, career politicians running for office and more outside businessmen who are going to fight for his America First agenda,\u201d Morris posted on social media this week.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 10:07:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Danielle Sassoon, the acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, submitted her resignation Thursday, according to letters obtained by ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "Danielle Sassoon accused the Justice Department of a quid pro quo.",
      "The stunning fallout over the Justice Department's move to drop the criminal corruption prosecution of New York Mayor Eric Adams continues to have ripple effects, resulting now in the resignations of at least six top department officials who have refused to sign onto the case's dismissal, sources told ABC News.",
      "The push to drop the case has led to at least three more top supervisory officials within the DOJ\u2019s Public Integrity Section to resign, sources said. The officials joined now-former acting US attorney for Manhattan Danielle Sassoon and two other career leaders of the department\u2019s Public Integrity Section -- which is tasked with prosecuting some of the most politically sensitive corruption cases pursued by the department.",
      "Sassoon submitted her resignation Thursday, just days after the Justice Department sought to end the federal bribery case against Adams.",
      "Prior to her resignation, Sassoon sent a letter on Wednesday to Attorney General Pam Bondi repeatedly urging Bondi to reverse course on dropping the criminal corruption case against Adams, as ordered in a letter earlier this week from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove.",
      "\"The reasons advanced by Mr. Bove for dismissing the indictment are not ones I can in good faith defend as in the public interest and as consistent with the principles of impartiality and fairness that guide my decision-making,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "In the letter, Sassoon repeatedly suggested DOJ leadership, including Bove, were explicitly aware of a quid pro quo suggested by Adams' attorneys, saying Adams' vocal support of Trump's immigration policies would be boosted by dismissing the indictment against him.",
      "\"Rather than be rewarded, Adams's advocacy should be called out for what it is: an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case,\" Sassoon writes. \"Although Mr. Bove disclaimed any intention to exchange leniency in this case for Adams's assistance in enforcing federal law, that is the nature of the bargain laid bare in Mr. Bove's memo.\"",
      "Sassoon was appointed by President Donald Trump in January to lead as acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York after Damian Williams stepped down from the role following Trump's election victory. Trump's permanent choice to lead the Southern District, Jay Clayton, has yet to be confirmed.",
      "Sassoon's resignation followed days of tension between the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan and leaders in the Justice Department over the bribery and campaign finance case against Adams.",
      "On Monday, Bove sent a memo that told Sassoon, \"You are directed, as authorized by the Attorney General, to dismiss the pending charges in United States v. Adams.\"",
      "To date, the office has not filed a motion to dismiss with the court.",
      "On Jan. 31, Sassoon was drawn into a conversation at DOJ headquarters in Washington about the future of the case.",
      "Sassoon's letter detailed the meeting with Bove and counsel for the mayor, where she says Adams' attorneys put forward \"what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" after which Bove \"admonished a member of my team who took notes during that meeting and directed the collection of those notes at the meeting's conclusion.\"",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with dismissal of a criminal indictment,\" Sassoon said. \"Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest.\"",
      "Adams' lawyer balked at that notion following Sassoon's resignation, \"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\"",
      "Sassoon's letter claimed that the U.S. Attorney's Office had already proposed seeking a superseding indictment against Adams under the new administration that would bolster the case with an additional obstruction conspiracy charge.",
      "\"We have proposed a superseding indictment that would add an obstruction conspiracy count based on evidence that Adams destroyed and instructed others to destroy evidence and provide false information to the FBI, and that would add further factual allegations regarding his participation in a fraudulent straw donor scheme,\" Sassoon said.",
      "She noted that Bove's contention that dismissing the indictment against Adams is warranted because it has interfered in his abilities to enforce federal immigration laws \"does not bear scrutiny.\"",
      "\"It does not grapple with the differential treatment Adams would receive compared to other elected officials, much less other criminal defendants,\" Sassoon said. \"And it is unclear why Adams would be better able to aid in immigration enforcement when the threat of future conviction is due to the possibility of reinstatement of the indictment followed by conviction at trial, rather than merely the possibility of conviction at trial.\"",
      "Sassoon closes the letter noting she remains \"baffled by the rushed and superficial process by which this decision was reached, in seeming collaboration with Adams's counsel and without my direct input on the ultimate stated rationales for dismissal.\"",
      "The failure to immediately heed the directive irked DOJ leadership, including Bove and Bondi.",
      "\"That case should be dropped. It was dead at the directive of Emil so that case should be dropped,\" Bondi told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "The Justice Department planned to remove the prosecutors handling the mayor's case and reassign it to the Public Integrity Section in Washington, D.C. However, as soon the Public Integrity Section was informed it would be taking over, John Keller, the acting head of the unit, and his boss, Kevin Driscoll, the senior most career official in the criminal division resigned, according to multiple sources.",
      "It is now unclear who will take over the Adams case and how soon it might be dropped, the sources said.",
      "The decision to drop Adams' case has led to an upheaval in the senior most ranks of an already embattled Justice Department.",
      "Bove admonished Sassoon over her repeated refusals to sign off on the dismissal in a letter responding to her resignation.",
      "\"You lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice by suggesting that you retain discretion to interpret the Constitution in a manner inconsistent with the policies of a democratically elected President and a Senate-confirmed Attorney General,\" Bove said in the letter obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"The Justice Department will not tolerate the insubordination and apparent misconduct reflected in the approach that you and your office have taken in this matter,\" Bove added.",
      "Bove claimed that Sassoon had suggested that Trump pardon the mayor instead of asking DOJ to drop the case. Bove said the proposal \"reveals that your office's insubordination is little more than a preference to avoid a duty that you regard as unpleasant and politically inconvenient.\"",
      "\"Your oath to uphold the Constitution does not permit you to substitute your policy judgment for that of the President or senior leadership of the Justice Department, and you are in no position to suggest that the President exercise his exclusive Article II authority to make your job easier,\" Bove said in his letter.",
      "He disputed what he calls \"strained\" suggestions by Sassoon that there was a \"quid pro quo\" involved in dropping the case against Adams.",
      "\"This is false, as you acknowledged previously in writing,\" Bove said. \"The Justice Department is charged with keeping people safe across the country. Your office's job is to help keep the City safe. But your actions have endangered it.\"",
      "According to Bove's letter, the assistant U.S. attorneys \"principally responsible for the case\" have been placed on off-duty administrative leave pending investigations of their conduct by the attorney general's office and DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility. He further noted their access to electronic devices has been revoked, and he ordered Sassoon and other trial attorneys to preserve any records they may have related to the case.",
      "Adams had pleaded not guilty to a five-count indictment that accused him of accepting years of luxury travel gifts in exchange for, among other things, persuading the fire department to approve the opening of the new Turkish consulate in Manhattan -- despite the lingering safety concerns of inspectors.",
      "Trump weighed in on the situation Thursday, claiming without any details or evidence that the acting U.S. attorney for SDNY was fired.",
      "\"I don't know if he or she resigned, but, that U.S. attorney was fired,\" the president told reporters during a news conference at the White House.",
      "Adams and Trump have become more close since the election, with the mayor meeting with Trump privately several times. At the last minute, Adams cancelled his appearances at Martin Luther King Jr. Day events in New York to attend the inauguration.",
      "The mayor has denied that he asked Trump to drop the charges or grant a pardon.",
      "When asked Thursday if he ordered the Justice Department to drop the case Trump replied, \"No, I didn't. I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a letter to the Southern District of New York on Monday, Bove questioned the timing of when the charges were brought, suggesting the case was part of the Biden administration's weaponization of the Justice Department, according to sources.",
      "Bove also said the case adversely affected Adams' ability to help the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, the sources added.",
      "In New York, Adams is facing increasing scrutiny and some calls to resign.",
      "Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado called Thursday night for New York City Mayor Eric Adams to resign, writing in a post on X, \"New York City deserves a Mayor accountable to the people, not beholden to the President. Mayor Adams should step down.\"",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, meanwhile, said she is still processing and thinking through the situation. Asked on Thursday night by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow about what she might do about theoretically removing Eric Adams from his position, Hochul called the Department of Justice's moves \"unbelievably unprecedented... This is not supposed to happen in our system of justice.\"",
      "But she said she did not want to commit to any specific action with Adams. \"The allegations are extremely concerning and serious. But I cannot, as the governor of this state, have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction, like a lot of other people are saying right now -- I have to do it smart. What's right? And I'm consulting with other leaders in government at this time.\"",
      "\"This just happened; I need some time to process this and figure out the right approach,\" she added later.",
      "Federal prosecutors were instructed to dismiss the case without prejudice, meaning it could come up again. However, Bove wrote nothing could happen until after this year's mayoral election.",
      "Despite that threat, Spiro expressed confidence Adams would not be prosecuted.",
      "\"There is no looming threat,\" Spiro said at a press conference Wednesday. \"This case is over.\"",
      "Any motion to dismiss the case would have to be formally filed in court and reviewed by the judge.",

      "Kennedy will set up a 'MAHA' commission to address chronic disease.",
      "Now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been sworn in as the nation's next health secretary Thursday, his first order of business will be to investigate America's problem with chronic illnesses.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News earlier that President Donald Trump would sign an executive order creating a \"Make America Health Again\" commission and direct Kennedy \"to investigate this chronic crisis plaguing our country and the minds and the bodies of the American people.\"",
      "What that will mean exactly remains to be seen. But here are three things to watch for as Kennedy takes the helm, based on what he and Trump have said in the past:",
      "More study on food dyes or other food additives?",
      "MAHA has easily emerged as a deeply popular slogan by Kennedy as much of America struggles with obesity and chronic diseases. The question though is how to do that in a way that won't weigh down the federal budget or trigger an avalanche of legal challenges from the food and drug industry.",
      "One possible avenue for Kennedy could be to call for additional safety studies of certain ingredients used by manufacturers, including food dyes.",
      "Last month, the Food and Drug Administration revoked its authorization of one type of red food dye. \"Red Dye No. 3\" is known to cause cancer in laboratory animals but was allowed to be used by manufacturers for years because scientists didn't believe it raised cancer risk in humans at the level typically consumed. The FDA, under President Joe Biden, acted after longtime pressure by consumer advocates.",
      "But a different type, Red Dye No. 40, remains on the market and hasn't been studied by the FDA in more than 20 years. FDA and health officials say there is no evidence though that it's harmful, and food manufacturers say they need to be able to rely on ingredients generally recognized as safe.",
      "Still, health advocates argue more can be done to look at the health impacts and or do the kind of post-market monitoring of food more common in Europe.",
      "All of those efforts though will take significant federal resources and rely on a workforce that Trump has promised to cut.",
      "Rewriting discrimination rules for hospitals, doctors and insurers to exclude transgender protections",
      "Kennedy hasn't personally focused much on the question of transgender rights. But eliminating federal rules at Health and Human Services that President Barack Obama and Joe Biden pushed to protect transgender Americans is a major priority for Trump and the conservative party.",
      "Federal law prohibits sexual discrimination, but it's up to the executive branch to spell out specific rules that schools, insurers and hospitals must follow if they want to retain access to federal aid.",
      "Obama triggered a fierce legal fight in his second term when he issued federal regulations aimed at protecting transgender people from discrimination in schools and medical settings. Under rules written by Obama's Health aand Human Services Department, doctors and hospitals were told couldn't decline care for a person because of their gender identity. Insurance companies also were specifically prohibited from offering different benefits to certain groups, including transgender individuals and people with HIV.",
      "Trump quickly dropped Obama's rules in his first term, writing new rules that granted exceptions for medical providers on discrimination rules if they cited religious objections.",
      "President Joe Biden tried to resurrect Obama's initial rules but was swiftly challenged in court by Republican states, tossing the issue back to Trump. It'll now be up to HHS under Kennedy, if he's confirmed, to decide what those federal rules should say.",
      "Making it easier for parents to send unvaccinated kids to public schools",
      "School vaccine requirements are up to the states, and currently all 50 states have laws requiring certain vaccines for students to attend public schools.",
      "But HHS sets the recommendations for childhood vaccines followed by schools, while the Education Department provides vital grant money to schools used to teach low-income or children with disabilities.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump threatened to revoke spending for schools that mandate vaccines currently recommended by public health experts and HHS.",
      "\"I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate,\" Trump declared last year.",
      "Such a move could have big implications for public health. According to the nonpartisan KFF, routine vaccination rates for kindergarten children is on the decline while exemptions are on the rise, including non-religious exemptions.",
      "While running for president before aligning with Trump, Kennedy rejected the numerous studies finding that childhood vaccines are safe, including several studies that debunked a myth that vaccines cause autism. During his Senate confirmation, Kennedy insisted he doesn't oppose vaccines but wants more study.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican doctor from Louisiana, said he was concerned by Kennedy's past in \"undermining confidence in vaccines with unfounded or misleading arguments.\" Facing a Republican primary next year, Cassidy decided to back Trump's pick after getting Kennedy to agree the two would work together closely.",
      "\"Ultimately, restoring trust in our public health institution is too important, and I think Mr. Kennedy can help get that done,\" Cassidy said.",

      "Zelenskyy warned against sidelining Ukraine on Thursday and that Trump should not meet with Putin before him. \u201cWe, as a sovereign country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,\u201d he told journalists in Ukraine on Thursday, adding that Europe must also be involved.",
      "\"If calls are just calls, I understand, but meetings are our priority. Ukraine, America, and only after those meetings, after working out a plan to stop Putin, would it be fair to talk with the Russians,\" he said.",
      "Some European leaders echoed this.",
      "German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said it was \"regrettable\" that \"the Trump administration has already made public concessions to Putin before negotiations have even begun.\"",
      "Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur concurred. \"We must not hand Russia any advantage before negotiations even begin,\" Pevkur said in a statement.",
      "It is not yet a disaster for Ukraine. Trump's position has been known for months, and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's announcements Wednesday did not fundamentally change it.",
      "Hegseth told foreign leaders and allies during a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting that a return to Ukraine's pre-war borders is an \"unrealistic objective\" in peace talks, as was NATO membership for Ukraine.",
      "\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Many in Ukraine already understood that NATO membership and reclaiming all its territory by force were not possible. What Ukrainian officials say is critical are security guarantees that prevent Russia from simply regrouping and attacking again.",
      "If Ukraine continues to receive enough weapons and support from the U.S. and Europe after a ceasefire, that could be sufficient. Its best guarantee will be its own strong military. Trump said Wednesday he would keep supporting Ukraine to stop Putin from \"saying he won.\"",
      "Zelensky on Thursday spoke again of what he has called \u201cPlan B\u201d, if Ukraine were to be barred from NATO. In that case, the country must \u201cbuild NATO\u201d on its territory, meaning its own military heavily armed with western weapons and backed by European peacekeeping troops.",
      "Hegseth suggested European and non-European troops could police a de-militarized zone in Ukraine, an idea that is being discussed by European leaders. But it would require a huge forced. Zelensky on Thursday said it would need 100,000 troops, something that would almost certainly be too much for European armies. Putin may also not accept it.",
      "The meetings at the Munich Security Conference starting Friday between Vice President JD Vance and Zelensky are now enormously high-stakes. Ukraine needs to be able to establish its minimum requirements.",
      "But what is clear is the call was a major diplomatic victory for Putin. Suddenly, the U.S. is much closer to his side.",

      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the United States President Donald Trump have spoken about easing tariffs and resolving trade concerns between the two countries, while also shoring up defense ties",
      "NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the U.S. President Donald Trump spoke about easing tariffs, resolving trade issues and shoring up defense ties in a meeting at the White House on Thursday.",
      "Even though Trump threatened to impose tariffs, the two leaders said they'd talk about trade, signaling that New Delhi and Washington could offer each other concessions.",
      "Trump called Modi a \u201cmuch better negotiator than me,\u201d while Modi played on Trump's \u201cMAGA,\u201d or \u201cMake America Great Again,\u201d catchphrase, saying he he was determined to \u201cMake India Great Again.\u201d",
      "Here are some key takeaways from the meeting:",
      "Trade and tariffs issues figured extensively in the meeting. Trump said New Delhi will not be spared and said the import levies imposed by India are \u201cvery unfair and strong.\u201d",
      "But he and Modi agreed to work on a deal to resolve trade concerns, which Modi said he expects to be completed later this year.",
      "Trump also said that his administration wants to bring down the trade deficit with India \u2014 which stands at $50 billion \u2014 by increasing U.S. energy exports to the country.",
      "Modi offered to double bilateral trade with Washington to $500 billion by 2030.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that Trump is trying to change the global trading order. India recognizes this and now is looking for a pragmatic way to resolve the differences,\u201d said Raja Mohan, an analyst at the Institute of South Asian Studies in Singapore.",
      "Trump said the U.S. will increase its military sales to India and eventually provide F-35 stealth fighter jets. He did not provide a timeline, but Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters that the process is \u201cat the stage of a proposal.\u201d",
      "Rahul Bedi, an India-based defense analyst, said such a deal could \u201ctake several years.\u201d",
      "Since 2008, India has contracted for over $20 billion worth of U.S.-origin defense equipment, and a recent deal will allow U.S.-based General Electric to partner with an Indian company to produce jet engines in India.",
      "Modi and Trump also agreed to deepen security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a thinly veiled reference to competition with growing China in the region.",
      "Trump said he\u2019d back extraditing one of the plotters of the 2008 Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed appearing to refer to Tahawwur Hussain Rana.",
      "Indian officials have accused Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agency of working with Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taibah to mastermind the attack, an allegation Islamabad has denied.",
      "If Rana is extradited to India, it will boost Modi's domestic standing. He's positioned himself as tough on archrival Pakistan.",
      "Modi and Trump also said they discussed immigration, with the Indian prime minister saying India will take back any of its citizens living illegally in the U.S.",
      "India recently accepted the return of 104 migrants brought back on a U.S. military plane.",

    "title": "Tesla shares have plunged while Musk takes on Washington. Is that the reason?",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 09:04:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Shares of Elon Musk's Tesla electric car company have fallen sharply, leading some investors to wonder if the drop is related to his cost-cutting work in Washington.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla's share price has fallen 30% since an all-time high in December.",
      "While Elon Musk has vaulted into a powerful role overhauling government agencies and upending Washington, the world's richest person has suffered a $106 billion drop in wealth due to steep decline in shares of his Tesla electric car company.",
      "Tesla's stock price has plummeted 30% from its all-time high in December, including a 21% selloff since Inauguration Day. The losses have sent Musk's net worth tumbling from a peak of $486 billion on Dec. 17 to its current level of about $380 billion, according to Bloomberg.",
      "The stock woes have divided current and former Tesla shareholders. Critics of Musk fault his new role and polarizing reputation, blaming recent reports showing lackluster sales in some regions on his foray into politics. They say Musk must step away from the Trump administration for the company to thrive.",
      "Supporters, on the other hand, say Musk's role in the White House has little to do with the selloff, noting that Tesla shares remain higher than where they stood on Election Day. Instead, some say, the company is suffering growing pains as it weathers stiff competition in electric vehicles and pursues new ventures like self-driving taxis.",
      "\"I don't have a problem if Elon wants to save a bunch of money for America. I say, 'Where's the good part in this for Tesla?'\" Ross Gerber, a prominent Tesla investor, told ABC News, referring to cost-cutting efforts undertaken by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Tesla representatives did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Despite disagreement over the effect of Musk's government role, both current and former Tesla shareholders who spoke to ABC News broadly acknowledged the company's recent business hiccups.",
      "Tesla sold fewer cars in 2024 than it did the year prior, marking the company's first year-over-year sales decline in more than a decade, earnings released in January showed.",
      "As rivals have challenged Tesla's dominance over the electric vehicle market, the company has promised a future revenue stream from autonomous taxis, also known as robotaxis.",
      "Musk announced in late January that the company would roll out its robotaxi test program in Austin, Texas, in June. But within days, China-based competitor BYD unveiled advances in self-driving technology, which the company said was set to be included in models costing as little as $9,600.",
      "Gary Black, managing partner of The Future Fund, which manages $100 million in assets, including Tesla shares, said the recent selloff of Tesla is primarily the result of investor jitters about whether the company can dominate self-driving technology the way it did electric vehicles.",
      "\"Over time, you will see Teslas and other cars self-drive. But Tesla is not going to be the only one,\" Black told ABC News' Elizabeth Schulze.",
      "The stock also faced downward pressure this week when a Musk-led group of investors offered to buy OpenAI for $97.4 billion, making possible a scenario in which Musk would sell some of his Tesla shares to finance the deal, Black said.",
      "Black said that, in his opinion, the downturn has nothing to do with Musk's government role.",
      "\"It's always good to know the president of the United States -- to be able to pick up your phone and say, you know, 'I need this favor, that favor,'\" Black said.",
      "A jump in Tesla shares after Trump's victory suggests many investors viewed the relationship that way. The stock price soared about 85% over a six-week period following Election Day.",
      "But some investors lay the blame for the downturn squarely at Musk's feet.",
      "Nell Minow, Vice Chair of ValueEdge Advisors and a longtime critic of Musk, said Musk has been \"absent\" from the company.",
      "\"I think that he is a huge drag on the stock right now,\" Minow told Schulze. \"No question, he's a problem.\"",
      "\"Elon Musk is to the Tesla brand what the Green Giant is to corn,\" Minow said. \"He has made himself the brand and that is always very risky.\"",
      "Minow, who said she donated nearly all of her Tesla shares to charity last year, also criticized the Tesla board for what she said was a failure to hold Musk to account, or update shareholders and the public about a leadership plan while Musk runs DOGE.",
      "\"We don't know what the board is thinking. They have not spoken out in any way,\" Minow said. \"They have not made a filing with the SEC about what the impact of this side hustle is, and the employees and the shareholders need some kind of certainty.\"",
      "New York City Comptroller Brad Lander echoed concerns about the board's ability to rein in Musk. Lander, who oversees $1.25 billion in Tesla stock through the city's five pension systems, said the lack of oversight was a \"long-standing problem.\"",
      "\"Independent governance is designed to provide a voice for shareholders at the table,\" Lander, who is running for New York City mayor and has publicly sparred with Musk, said in a statement to ABC News. \"When companies are controlled by a set of directors with either family or aligned interests, they lose this.\"",
      "For his part, Musk has looked to hype up Tesla's prospects, saying on an earnings call last month that he believes there is an opportunity for it to be \"the most valuable company in the world.\"",
      "During the call, AllianceBernstein Research analyst Daniel Roska questioned Musk on how Tesla plans to meet its ambitious projections given its high valuation.",
      "Musk emphasized Tesla's focus on real-world AI, claiming the company is making significant strides.",
      "\"We're working on perfecting real-world AI and making rapid progress week over week, if not month over month,\" Musk said. \"I go where the problem is, essentially ... I focus where the challenges are the greatest.\"",
      "Some Tesla shareholders remain bullish on the company despite its short-term drop. Angel investor Larry Goldberg, known as \"Tesla Larry,\" posted on X that he supports Musk's political efforts, even if they impact the company's stock price.",
      "\"If the Trump administration (and DOGE) does not fix the deficit, my Tesla shares -- and everyone's US stocks and bonds will be worthless,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Musk reposted Goldberg's comment, adding, \"Exactly.\"",

      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas man who murdered his strip club manager and another man, then later prompted a massive lockdown of the state prison system when he used a cellphone smuggled into death row to threaten a lawmaker, was scheduled to be executed Thursday.",
      "Richard Lee Tabler, 46, would be the second inmate executed in Texas in a little over a week, with two more scheduled by the end of April. He's set to receive a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.",
      "Tabler was condemned for the Thanksgiving 2004 shooting deaths of Mohammed-Amine Rahmouni, 28, and Haitham Zayed, 25, in a remote area near Killeen in Central Texas. Rahmouni was the manager of a strip club where Tabler worked until he was banned from the place. Zayed was a friend of Rahmouni, and police said both men were killed in a late-night meeting to buy some stolen stereo equipment that was actually a planned ambush.",
      "Tabler also confessed to killing two teenage girls who worked at the club, Tiffany Dotson, 18, and Amanda Benefield, 16. He was indicted but never tried in their killings.",
      "Tabler has repeatedly asked the courts that his appeals be dropped and that he be put to death. He also has changed his mind on that point several times, and his attorneys have questioned whether he is mentally competent to make that decision. Tabler\u2019s prison record includes at least two instances of attempted suicide, and he was previously granted a stay of execution in 2010.",
      "\u201cPetitioner has spent the last twenty years in the Courts, and see's no point in wasting this Courts time, nor anyone else's,\u201d Tabler wrote to the state Court of Criminal Appeals on Dec. 9, 2024, after his current execution date was set.",
      "Tabler's death row phone calls in 2008 to state Sen. John Whitmire, who is now the mayor of Houston, prompted an unprecedented lockdown of more than 150,000 inmates in the the nation's second-largest prison system. Some were confined to their cells for weeks while officers swept more than 100 prisons to seize hundreds of items of contraband, including cellphones.",
      "Whitmire led a Senate committee with oversight of state prisons, and said at the time that Tabler warned him that he knew the names of his children and where they lived. Whitmire, through a spokesperson at the mayor's office, declined to comment on Tabler's pending execution.",
      "The ACLU appealed Tabler\u2019s case to the U.S. Supreme Court last year, claiming he was denied adequate legal representation during his lower court appeals by attorneys who refused to participate in hearings at what they said was his request.",
      "The ACLU appeal argued that Tabler's attorneys ignored a psychological exam that determined he had a \u201cdeep and severe constellation of mental illnesses\u201d that had been ignored since childhood. The court refused to halt his execution.",
      "Tabler worked at a bar called TeaZers and investigators said he had a conflict with his boss, Rahmouni, who allegedly said he could have Tabler's family \u201cwiped out\u201d for $10.",
      "Tabler recruited a friend, a soldier at nearby Fort Cavazos, and lured Rahmouni and Zayed to a meeting. Tabler shot them both in their car, then pulled Rahmouni out and had the friend record a video of him shooting Rahmouni again.",
      "Tabler later confessed to the killings. During the sentencing phase of his trial, prosecutors introduced Tabler's written and videotaped statements that he also killed Dotson and Benefield days later because he was worried they would tell people he killed the men.",
      "Investigators said that before he was arrested, Tabler called the Bell County Sheriff's Office to taunt deputies about the murders, and threatened to kill more strip club employees and undercover law enforcement at the club.",

      "A New Hampshire town and a bakery owner are scheduled for trial in a First Amendment dispute about a painting of a sun and pastries",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- A First Amendment dispute over a bright painting that shows sunbeams shining down on a mountain range made of sprinkle-covered chocolate and strawberry doughnuts, a blueberry muffin, a cinnamon roll and other pastries is scheduled for trial Thursday.",
      "A federal judge in New Hampshire will consider whether a town is infringing on the free speech rights of the bakery owner who's displaying the mural over his business.",
      "\u201cI think the whole town is following this story,\u201d said Sean Young, the owner of Leavitt's Country Bakery in Conway, a community of more than 10,000 people near the White Mountains that draws skiers, nature lovers and shoppers. Some residents want regulations enforced as they worry about overdevelopment in the tourist town.",
      "The mural atop the bakery, which was founded over 45 years ago, is a creation of local high school art students. When it went up in June 2022, the painting attracted a lot of compliments and visitors, including one from a town zoning officer.",
      "The zoning board decided that the painting was not so much art as advertising. The board determined it was a sign, and so it could not remain as is because of its size. At about 90 square feet (8.6 square meters), it\u2019s four times bigger than the local sign code allows.",
      "If the painting didn't show what's sold inside \u2014 baked goods \u2014 it wouldn't be considered a sign and could stay, board members said.",
      "Lawyers for the town say that it has shown that \u201crestricting the size of signs serves the significant government interest of preserving the town\u2019s aesthetics, promoting safety, and ensuring equal enforcement,\u201d according to a court document.",
      "Young was told to modify or remove the painting. Faced with possible misdemeanor criminal charges and fines after his appeals were rejected, he sued the town in federal court in 2023, saying his freedom of speech rights were violated.",
      "\u201cGovernment officials don\u2019t get to tell people, including entrepreneurs and businesses, what they can and can\u2019t paint,\u201d the Virginia-based Institute for Justice, which is representing Young, said in a news release at the time. \"And no one can say with a straight face that Leavitt\u2019s mural would be any safer, healthier or more aesthetically pleasing if it portrayed flowers instead of pastries.\u201d",
      "Young is asking for $1 in damages. His lawyers say the town's definition of a sign is overly broad and that the town hasn't shown that anything bad will happen if the painting continues to stay up. It hasn't been removed.",
      "Part of Conway's sign code states that the town \"has no intention of restricting individual free speech, but the town does recognize its right to place reasonable restrictions upon commercial speech.\u201d",
      "The town has enforced its sign code against other businesses. In 2006, for example, it said an ice cream parlor's trash cans, which were shaped like ice cream cones, were signs. The business asked for and got permission from the town to use the cans. In another case, a sporting goods store agreed to remove window screens with photos of mountain bikes and skis after the town determined they were signs.",
      "Young's lawsuit was paused for a few months in 2023 as residents considered revising how the town defines signs, in a way that would have allowed the painting to stay up. But that measure was seen as too broad and complex, and it failed to pass.",
      "Last year, voters passed a new ordinance that requires applicants to meet criteria for art on public and commercial property but it has not applied to Young's case."

    "summary": "The Treasury Department&rsquo;s Office of Inspector General says it's launching an audit of the security controls for the federal government&rsquo;s payment system",
    "story": [
      "The Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General says it's launching an audit of the security controls for the federal government\u2019s payment system",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department's Office of Inspector General on Friday said it was launching an audit of the security controls for the federal government's payment system, after Democratic senators raised red flags about the access provided to Trump aide Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency team.",
      "The audit will also review the past two years of the system's transactions as it relates to Musk's assertion of \u201calleged fraudulent payments,\u201d according to a letter from Loren J. Sciurba, Treasury\u2019s deputy inspector general, that was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The audit marks part of the broader effort led by Democratic lawmakers and federal employee unions to provide transparency and accountability about DOGE's activities under President Donald Trump's Republican administration. The Musk team has pushed for access to the government's computer systems and sought to remove tens of thousands of federal workers.",
      "\u201cWe expect to begin our fieldwork immediately,\u201d Sciburba wrote. \u201cGiven the breadth of this effort, the audit will likely not be completed until August; however, we recognize the danger that improper access or inadequate controls can pose to the integrity of sensitive payment systems. As such, if critical issues come to light before that time, we will issue interim updates and reports.\u201d",
      "Tech billionaire Musk, who continues to control Tesla, X and SpaceX among other companies, claims to be finding waste, fraud and abuse while providing savings to taxpayers, many of his claims so far unsubstantiated. But there is a risk that his team's aggressive efforts could lead to the failure of government computer systems and enable Musk and his partners to profit off private information maintained by the government.",
      "Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ron Wyden of Oregon led the push for the inspector general office's inquiry.",
      "On Wednesday, Warren, Wyden and Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noting the inconsistencies in the accounts provided by his department about DOGE.",
      "\u201cYour lack of candor about these events is deeply troubling given the threats to the economy and the public from DOGE\u2019s meddling, and you need to provide a clear, complete, and public accounting of who accessed the systems, what they were doing, and why they were doing it,\u201d the Democratic lawmakers wrote in their letter.",
      "The Treasury Department provided conflicting information about DOGE's access to the payment system. Initially, it claimed the access was read only, only to then acknowledge that a DOGE team member briefly had the ability to edit code, and then to say in an employee sworn statement that the ability to edit was granted by accident.",
      "The 25-year-old employee granted the access, Marko Elez, resigned this month after racist posts were discovered on one of his social media accounts, only for Musk to call for his rehiring with the backing of Trump and Vice President JD Vance.",
      "Advocacy groups and labor unions have filed lawsuits over DOGE\u2019s potential unauthorized access to sensitive Treasury payment systems, and five former treasury secretaries have sounded the alarm on the risks associated with Musk\u2019s DOGE accessing sensitive Treasury Department payment systems and potentially stopping congressionally authorized payments.",
      "Earlier this week, the Treasury declined to brief a pair of the highest-ranking lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee, including Wyden, on the ongoing controversy related to DOGE's use of Treasury payment systems, citing ongoing litigation.",

      "NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. -- At Niagara Falls, the iconic honeymoon and tourist destination on the U.S.-Canadian border, visitors from both countries took in President Donald Trump\u2019s unsolicited suggestion that the U.S. annex its neighbor to the north with an air of detached amusement.",
      "Do they take the idea seriously? Generally speaking, no. But some citizens of both nations wonder why it\u2019s necessary to pick a fight with one of America\u2019s closest allies when there wasn\u2019t much friction there to begin with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re allies,\u201d said Shannon Robinson, of Milton, Ontario. \u201cWe love you guys. And we\u2019re proud of the amicable relationship we have. But we\u2019re also proud to be distinct.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s idea is bold, offensive and ignorant, but \u201che can say what he wants, and it's actually bringing Canadians together right now,\" said Robinson, standing on the Niagara Falls Observation Tower, which extends over the Niagara Gorge and affords an unobstructed view of all three falls and the Niagara River.",
      "In some instances, that togetherness involved booing. The response was slightly more muted on a recent day as bundled-up tourists from all over the world braved sub-freezing temperatures to catch a glimpse of the majestic falls.",
      "Jeremy Powers, of Panama City, Florida, said the Republican U.S. president's talk of annexing one of America's closest allies and trading partners is \u201cvery weird.\u201d",
      "\u201cHaving that as their own independent nation needs to be maintained, I feel,\u201d said Powers, who was in New York state on a work trip and decided to check out Niagara Falls.",
      "\u201cYou know, we don\u2019t need to try and manifest destiny and gather more land. We need to partner and work with other countries in a more friendly manner,\u201d Powers said before dropping down on one knee to open up a bag containing his camera equipment.",
      "Manifest destiny, the idea that the United States is exceptional among world nations and destined by God to expand its territory across North America, drove U.S. growth through the 19th century. Territorial expansion was not a prominent feature of foreign policy debates before Trump started talking about taking on Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal \u2014 and even colonizing Mars.",
      "\u201cThe United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons,\u201d Trump said in his inaugural address. \u201cAnd we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.\u201d",
      "Canadian energy minister Jonathan Wilkinson agreed that Trump is uniting Canadians, but he said they're done laughing about his talk of annexation.",
      "\u201cOn the 51st state, I think, you know, when that was said the first time, some people thought it was funny,\u201d Wilkinson said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI don\u2019t think Canadians find it funny anymore.\u201d",
      "Back at Niagara Falls, plumes of vapor rose off the frigid water. On Rainbow Bridge, an American flag and a Canadian flag stand feet apart, the representation of two neighboring countries overseeing the shared beauty of nature.",
      "Joseph Sullivan, a landscaper who made the trek from New Orleans to upstate New York, sees Trump\u2019s proposal as \u201charsh.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll he\u2019s doing,\" Sullivan said, \u201cis creating chaos and making other countries want to hate America.\u201d",

      "A lawsuit alleging a white nationalist hate group intimidated immigrant business owners in North Dakota has settled",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Two North Dakota nonprofits have settled their lawsuit against a white nationalist hate group that alleged it intimidated immigrant business owners, though the details are unclear.",
      "A court docket entry last week gave notice of the settlement following a conference in Fargo, and attorneys have not provided details.",
      "In 2023, the North Dakota Human Rights Coalition, the Immigrant Development Center and the center's executive director sued Patriot Front, two of its leaders and 10 unidentified others, alleging they violated the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871, among other claims. The plaintiffs sought unspecified damages to be determined at trial, along with other requested relief.",
      "Their complaint alleged members of Patriot Front vandalized businesses and public property in recent years, including spray-painting Patriot Front designs on the front of the International Market Plaza, an indoor marketplace for immigrant business owners in Fargo. The complaint also claims they defaced a mural depicting Black women wearing hijabs.",
      "Last year, a federal judge dismissed some of the claims against two Patriot Front leaders, Thomas Rousseau and Trevor Valescu.",
      "An assistant for the white nationalist group\u2019s attorney, Jason Lee Van Dyke, said this week that he was unavailable to comment on the settlement. A spokesperson for a legal group representing the plaintiffs said Thursday they could not immediately provide comment.",
      "Other lawsuits in recent years have cited the Ku Klux Klan Act, including one from multiple Democratic U.S. representatives against President Donald Trump in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Last month, a federal judge awarded a Black man more than $2.7 million in his lawsuit citing the same civil rights law against Patriot Front, Rousseau and unnamed others. He had accused group members of beating him in \u201ccoordinated, brutal, and racially motivated attack\" in 2022 in Boston.",
      "Patriot Front is a white nationalist hate group that broke off from Vanguard America, a group involved in the deadly \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, said Rachel Carroll Rivas, interim director at the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project. Patriot Front is \u201cvery theatrical\u201d with marches, public displays and racist propaganda, she said.",
      "The North Dakota lawsuit could impact the group's recruitment because of the accountability it brings, Carroll Rivas said.",
      "\u201cIf we have less people involved, that is a win,\u201d she said."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s newly installed attorney general, Pam Bondi, is going after New York leaders over the state\u2019s immigration policies",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's newly installed attorney general, Pam Bondi, went after New York leaders Wednesday over the state's immigration policies, announcing a lawsuit in the latest effort by the Republican administration to carry out the president's hardline immigration campaign pledges.",
      "In her first press conference since taking office last week, Bondi accused New York leaders of prioritizing \u201cillegal aliens over American citizens.\" Standing in front of federal agents who have been tasked with helping in Trump's immigration crackdown, she echoed the president's rhetoric as she vowed the Justice Department would take on communities that thwart federal immigration efforts.",
      "The lawsuit against New York Attorney General Letitia James and Gov. Kathy Hochul targets a state law that allows people who might not be in the U.S. legally to get driver\u2019s licenses. The so-called Green Light Law was enacted partly to improve public safety on the roads, as people without licenses sometimes drove without one, or without having passed a road test. The state also makes it easier for holders of such licenses to get auto insurance, thus cutting down on crashes involving uninsured drivers.",
      "The lawsuit describes the law as \u201ca frontal assault on the federal immigration laws, and the federal authorities that administer them.\" It highlights a provision that requires the state's Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner to inform people who are in the country illegally when a federal immigration agency has requested their information. The Justice Department is asking the court to strike down the law.",
      "\u201cThis is a new DOJ, and we are taking steps to protect Americans,\u201d said Bondi, with agents from the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Drug Enforcement Administration lined up behind her. \u201cMillions of illegal aliens with violent records have flooded into our communities, bringing violence and deadly drugs with them.\u201d",
      "Bondi\u2019s politically charged rhetoric, unusual for an institution that has historically been wary of aligning itself so directly with the White House, and the selection of legal targets raise fresh concerns that she could seek to use the agency\u2019s law enforcement powers to go after the president\u2019s adversaries. James, the New York attorney general, has drawn Trump\u2019s ire by suing him, leading to a civil fraud judgment that stands to cost Trump nearly $500 million.",
      "James said in a statement that she's prepared to defend the state's laws, which she said \u201cprotect the rights of all New Yorkers and keep our communities safe.\u201d",
      "Hochul said New York welcomes \u201claw-abiding individuals who want to work, pay taxes and contribute to our communities, while at the same time protecting the public safety of all New Yorkers by cracking down on violent criminals.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe expect Pam Bondi\u2019s worthless, publicity-driven lawsuit to be a total failure, just like all the others. Let me be clear: New York is not backing down,\u201d the governor said in a statement.",
      "Bondi appeared alongside Tammy Nobles, whose 20-year-old daughter Kayla was killed in Aberdeen, Maryland, in July 2022 by someone from El Salvador who entered the country illegally months earlier in Texas. The assailant, then 16, was released to a first cousin to pursue asylum, which is common practice under U.S. law and policy. He had been accused by authorities in El Salvador of affiliation with the violent MS-13 gang, according to a report by Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "To trumpet his immigration policies, Trump has often highlighted \u201cangel moms\u201d like Nobles, who lost their loved ones to violent crimes by people in the country illegally.",
      "\u201cTammy represents not only herself and her family but all of the great angel moms around this country who have suffered because of what the Biden administration did,\u201d Bondi said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s over.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes days after the Justice Department sued the city of Chicago, alleging that its \u201c sanctuary\u201d laws were thwarting federal efforts to enforce immigration laws.",
      "In 2020, the Trump administration sought to pressure New York into changing its law by barring anyone from the state from enrolling in trusted traveler programs, meaning they would spend longer amounts of time going through security lines at airports.",
      "New York\u2019s governor at the time, Andrew Cuomo, offered to restore federal access to driving records on a limited basis, but said he wouldn\u2019t let immigration agents see lists of people who had applied for the special licenses available to immigrants who couldn\u2019t prove legal residency in the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration ultimately restored New Yorkers\u2019 access to the trusted traveler program after a brief legal fight.",

      "No longer in charge, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been speaking his mind",
      "WASHINGTON -- No longer in charge, Sen. Mitch McConnell has been speaking his mind, the long-serving GOP leader rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s more high-profile Cabinet nominees \u2014 alone at times, among the Republicans, casting his no votes.",
      "When it came to Pete Hegseth, now the defense secretary, who faced allegations of excessive drinking and aggressive behavior toward women, McConnell said the combat veteran had \u201cfailed, as yet, to demonstrate\u201d he was ready for the job.",
      "The \u201cdesire to be a change agent is not enough,\u201d McConnell said.",
      "On Tulsi Gabbard, who was sworn in this week as director of national intelligence, he said she has displayed \u201ca history of alarming lapses in judgment,\u201d citing in particular her views toward Russia, China and the security breach by former government contractor Edward Snowden.",
      "And as Senate Republicans confirmed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, McConnell, a survivor of childhood polio  who used a wheelchair during the vote, opposed.",
      "\u201cA record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts,\u201d the Kentucky senator said.",
      "This is McConnell unplugged, three weeks into the Trump administration, and his new role as no longer the Senate GOP leader but one of 100 senators. It is testing the strength, but also the limits, of his influence on the institution, where he has been a monumental presence for nearly 40 years.",
      "McConnell is far from an anti-Trump Republican and hardly the face of the GOP opposition to the White House. He has voted to confirm Trump\u2019s other nominees and said he expects to support Trump's agenda.",
      "But his opposition to the trio of Trump's most controversial nominees stands out. Taken together, McConnell's votes against Hegseth, Gabbard and RFK Jr. provide a window into the type of leader he intends to be outside the stately leadership office. And it shows the shifts in his power, as few other Republicans joined him, leaving him often on his own, with Democrats, unable to stop Trump's choices.",
      "\u201cMcConnell\u2019s votes on the Trump nominees reflect, at least in part, the fact that he is more free to vote in accord with personal preferences than he was when he was responsible for serving as the leader and voice for Senate Republicans,\u201d said Frances Lee, a professor of politics and public affairs at Princeton.",
      "Just two other Republicans, the independent-minded Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, also voted against Hegseth.",
      "\u201cNow that he is no longer in leadership, Sen. McConnell enjoys more freedom to simply exercise his own individual judgment and personal discretion,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Trump lashed out after the latest votes, calling McConnell \u201cbitter\u201d and \u201cnot equipped mentally\u201d during a lengthy rant in the Oval Office late Thursday, after Kennedy was sworn into office.",
      "\u201cI feel sorry for Mitch,\u201d the Republican president said.",
      "\u201cHe votes against almost everything now. He\u2019s a, you know, very bitter guy,\u201d Trump said of McConnell, who had been a crucial partner as the Senate majority leader during Trump's first term.",
      "Together, Trump and McConnell passed shared priorities, notably the 2017 GOP tax bill, but the two also clashed \u2014 the president calling the senator \u201cOld Crow,\u201d which McConnell turned into a badge of honor \u2014 and had a very public falling out after the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden. McConnell called Trump \u201cmorally responsible\u201d for the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection by a mob of his supporters at the Capitol but ultimately endorsed Trump's reelection bid.",
      "Trump did not appear Thursday to understand that McConnell had polio as a child, a factor as he weighed Kennedy's nomination.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s lost his power,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things.\u201d",
      "When he announced he was stepping down as GOP leader, McConnell said he would finish his Senate term, which expires after the 2026 election. It\u2019s unclear if he will run again.",
      "To be sure, McConnell is far from marginalized. He commands prime positions as chairman of the influential Rules Committee as well as the chairman of the Appropriation Committee\u2019s subcommittee on defense, where he has signaled he intends to make his mark shoring up the nation\u2019s military assets and assuring U.S. leadership on the global stage.",
      "\u201cI expect to support most of what this administration is trying to accomplish,\u201d McConnell said during a recent interview on CBS' \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d",
      "The senator still faces polio\u2019s lingering effects, particularly in his left leg. McConnell fell twice recently, on the steps from the Senate chamber, where he was swiftly caught and steadied by two GOP colleagues, and a short time later in the private GOP lunchroom. He sometimes uses a wheelchair as he did this week as a precaution.",
      "Other senators are watching and weighing the turn of events.",
      "\u201cHe seems to be liberated, and I think he\u2019s voting his conscience,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat.",

    "story": [
      "When the Illinois Department of Corrections shut down the century-old Stateville Correctional Center in September, officials transferred 278 inmates convicted of murder and dozens more serving time for violent crimes to other lockups across the state",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Among the approximately 400 inmates transferred when Illinois' decrepit Stateville prison closed over the summer, 278 were convicted of murder and 100 more are serving time for other violent offenses.",
      "Yet, nearly four in five of the offenders formerly housed at the suburban Chicago lockup were not shipped to top-level maximum-security prisons, where the toughest criminals, troublemakers and escape risks are housed. Instead, they went to mid-level medium-security facilities, according to an Associated Press analysis of Illinois Department of Corrections data.",
      "Prison employees believe housing for the transferred inmates was based on which facilities had bed space and sufficient personnel who are adequately trained in a critically understaffed system.",
      "Corrections spokesperson Naomi Puzzello said all of the transfers from Stateville are appropriately housed and that none was reclassified to a lower security level to match that of the receiving prison. She acknowledged scores of maximum-security beds are vacant but said corrections' understaffing played no role in the transfers.",
      "However, the AP obtained minutes from a meeting at a separate facility nearly a year before Stateville's shutdown in which administrators discouraged staff from bumping troublemakers up to a higher risk level because \u201cmaximum security beds are in short supply.\u201d",
      "And the AP found that in more than half of the relocations, ex-Stateville inmates were transferred without regard to a corrections guideline that those serving sentences of 30 years or more be housed in max prisons.",
      "Opened in 1925, Stateville was targeted for closure in the spring when Gov. JB Pritzker set aside $900 million to replace it and Logan Correctional Center, the deteriorating women\u2019s facility in central Illinois. A federal judge, accelerating the plan by declaring Stateville uninhabitable and inaccessible, ordered it shuttered by Sept. 30.",
      "Prison staff shortages are a problem nationally. Wisconsin has seen a spate of inmate deaths while it struggles with vacant posts. \u201cGrossly inadequate\u201d staffing was among problems listed last fall in a searing Justice Department critique of violence, drugs and sexual abuse in Georgia prisons.",
      "Data compiled by the nonprofit Safer Prisons, Safer Communities shows that the number of state-employed corrections officers dropped from 237,000 in 2012 to 182,000 in 2023.",
      "Simply put, it's a tough job, said Wanda Bertram of the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research and advocacy group that espouses decarceration.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to witness violence, you might witness serious mental illness,\" Bertram said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be around a lot of drug use and these things have a measurable impact on corrections workers.\u201d",
      "The Illinois Department of Corrections is 396 frontline security officers short of what was budgeted, according to October department staffing numbers. Total current officers are more than 2,800 shy of the authorized headcount, or the number needed to operate without substantial overtime.",
      "Under the Illinois public records law, AP obtained a list of 406 inmates housed at Stateville as of August 2024 and matched each with the prison to which they\u2019d been transferred, noting its security level. Corrections denied a request for the accompanying pre-transfer security levels of each inmate.",
      "Statewide, there are 1,750 currently unoccupied beds in max prisons, Puzzello said. However, the majority are in cells designed for two inmates and most prisoners are in single-occupancy cells, so short staffing isn't to blame, she maintained. The agency continues to vigorously recruit security cadets.",
      "Employees are unconvinced and believe some inmates who qualify for max security have been diverted to less secure places, posing a risk to inmates as well as staff.",
      "Although not part of the latest transfers, an offender moved to Sheridan Correctional Center in north-central Illinois from Stateville in November 2023 viciously attacked a prison educator, who required facial reconstruction surgery, according to the employees' union, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 31.",
      "There have been at least two suspected homicides of inmates since mid-2024, but corrections denied the AP's public records request for information on them. The news agency is appealing that decision.",
      "High-security bed space appears to have been an issue months before Stateville's shutdown. In minutes obtained by the AP from a December 2023 management meeting at Dixon Correctional Center in northern Illinois, administrators advised staff to \u201cuse good judgment\u201d before upgrading a troublemaker's risk level to maximum, necessitating a transfer.",
      "\u201cMaximum security beds throughout the state are in short supply,\" the minutes say. \"If we try to transfer all the max security individuals, they will more than likely just end up at another medium security facility.\u201d",
      "Puzzello reiterated that none of the Stateville transfers had security downgrades. She said transfers are based not only on criminal background but on programming needs, medical and mental health treatment and staffing ratios at the receiving facility.",
      "\u201cThis ensures each individual\u2019s classification is appropriate and tailored to their specific risk factors, behaviors and needs, supporting a safe and secure correctional environment,\" Puzzello said.",
      "However, a general corrections guideline is that any offender serving a sentence of 30 or more years be housed in a maximum-security cell. Those with 10 to 30 years go to medium, according to the guideline.",
      "Of ex-Stateville inmates, 261 \u2014 or 64% \u2014 locked up for 30 or more years are now sitting in medium-security prisons, according to the AP review.",
      "AFSCME spokesperson Anders Lindall said prison counselors who evaluated each inmate for an appropriate transfer location believed management had already decided where each would go. Puzzello denied that happened.",
      "Lindall said the union received reports of \u201congoing instances of recommendations made at the facility level -- by employees whose job it is to evaluate, classify and place the offenders who they know best \u2014 being overruled by departmental management.\u201d"

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro on Thursday sued agencies under President Donald Trump, saying they are illegally and unconstitutionally withholding billions in federal aid from the state that had already been approved by Congress.",
      "Shapiro, a Democrat, filed the lawsuit despite the fact that federal courts have repeatedly rejected the Trump administration's sweeping pause on federal funding, and Shapiro's lawyers suggest that the Trump administration is continuing to ignore court orders to restore access to the suspended money.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Philadelphia, calls actions by the federal agencies \u201cflagrantly lawless\u201d and said the agencies have no legal authority to unilaterally refuse to spend congressionally appropriated money over a policy disagreement.",
      "Further, the agencies have provided no plausible explanation for the suspension, Shapiro's lawyers said.",
      "Shapiro, his agencies and members of Congress have tried to try to fully restore access to the money, the lawsuit said.",
      "\u201cDespite that work, and despite two temporary restraining orders requiring federal agencies to restore access to suspended funds, federal agencies continue to deny Pennsylvania agencies funding that they are entitled to receive,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "The federal agencies named as defendants \u2014 the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Energy, Interior and Transportation \u2014 did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. In the Department of Interior's case, it said its policy is not to comment on pending litigation.",
      "The Trump administration issued a memo in late January freezing federal grants and loans. Administration officials said the pause was necessary to review whether spending aligned with Trump\u2019s executive orders on issues such as climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "The freeze caused widespread chaos.",
      "The Trump administration rescinded the memo less than two days later, but money for things such as early childhood education, pollution reduction and HIV prevention research remained tied up, nearly two dozen Democratic states said in a federal lawsuit.",
      "A judge ordered the administration on Monday to \u201cimmediately take every step necessary\u201d to unfreeze all federal grants and loans, finding that the Trump administration hadn't fully followed his earlier order. The Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling and lost Tuesday.",
      "In Pennsylvania\u2019s case, the Shapiro administration said about $2.5 billion in grants or reimbursements committed to Pennsylvania is now suspended or under some sort of review that hasn\u2019t been approved by Congress or any funding agreement, and hasn\u2019t been explained to Shapiro\u2019s administration.",
      "The lawsuit said aid is being withheld from programs that distribute money to plug abandoned gas wells, improve energy efficiency in homes, upgrade rural electric service and reimburse industry for cutting their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is holding up money for wildfire mitigation projects funded through legislation championed by his Democratic predecessor",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- President Donald Trump's administration is holding up money for wildfire mitigation projects funded through legislation championed by his Democratic predecessor, threatening efforts to prevent catastrophic blazes like the ones that recently ripped through Southern California.",
      "The decision undermines Trump's repeated insistence that communities need to clear combustible materials like fallen branches and undergrowth \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s called management of the floor,\u201d he said while visiting Los Angeles last month \u2014 to guard against wildfires.",
      "Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the Interior Department, said via email that mitigation work is \u201ccurrently undergoing review to ensure consistency\u201d with Trump\u2019s executive orders.",
      "The scrutiny is being applied only to projects using money from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, two centerpieces of former President Joe Biden's administration. They included roughly $3 billion for wildfire mitigation efforts, often known as hazardous fuels reduction programs.",
      "Peace said those programs are continuing if funded by other congressional appropriations.",
      "Lomakatsi Restoration Project, a forest management nonprofit that develops and implements programs to reduce hazardous fuels and wildfire threat in Oregon, northern California and Idaho, has stopped work on projects funded by Biden's legislation, which provides 65% of its $17 million budget.",
      "Executive director Marko Bey said he laid off 15 full-time employees after being told by federal officials the funding was frozen pending review, with no information on when it would be released.",
      "\u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make good business sense to keep operating, not knowing if we\u2019re going to get paid or if at some point the administration is going to rescind some of this,\u201d Bey said. He called it a \u201creally challenging situation.\u201d",
      "Mitigation work, which includes removing small and dead trees with logging equipment or through controlled burns, can prevent forests from becoming tinderboxes. It often takes place in winter and spring in preparation for warmer months when fires can be more severe. Wildfire season traditionally starts in May and ends in November, though blazes can occur year-round because of warmer, drier conditions exacerbated by climate change.",
      "The latest example came last month in the Los Angeles area, where fires killed at least 29 people and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures in what is projected to be among the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.",
      "Trump has talked about forest management since his first term, when he visited California after the Camp Fire killed 85 people in 2018.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take care of the floors,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, the floors of the forest, very important.\u201d In Finland, he said, \u201cthey spend a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things.\u201d",
      "He issued an executive order intended to improve management of federal lands, and in 2020 he complained about California officials.",
      "\u201cI said, you gotta clean your floors, you gotta clean your forests,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are many, many years of leaves and broken trees, and they\u2019re like, like, so flammable, you touch them and it goes up.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe we\u2019re just going to have to make them pay for it,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t listen to us.\u201d",
      "Democratic lawmakers have called for federal funding to resume.",
      "\u201cHalting these payments is not only unlawful but also endangers our rural communities by removing a vital component of their economies and delaying critical work to mitigate the threat of wildfire,\u201d Sens. Martin Heinrich New Mexico, Patty Murray of Washington, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Tuesday in a letter to the administration.",
      "Harrison Fields, a deputy press secretary at the White House, defended the administration's approach.",
      "\u201cJust because there\u2019s a review doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a desire for this work to get done,\u201d he said. \u201cProper oversight of the dollars is just as important as ensuring that California gets restored.\u201d",
      "Fields also said that \"there has been no bigger advocate for restoring California to its natural beauty than President Trump, which is why he made it a point to visit the region in his first week in office and he\u2019s continuing to put tremendous pressure on state and local government to reduce the barriers in restoring the area.\u201d",
      "The review ordered by Trump is also disrupting a $1 billion grant program that helps local jurisdictions better prepare for fires through neighborhood risk assessments and community outreach programs.",
      "Kimiko Barrett of Headwaters Economics in Bozeman, Montana, who worked with counties in the state to secure Community Wildfire Defense Grants, said grant recipients were told Monday that payments had been paused for at least 10 days.",
      "\u201cComing out of Los Angeles, we have learned that this is a crisis involving very specific risk reduction efforts,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cWithout this program communities will not have the tools to continue the very important mitigation work that's needed.\u201d",
      "There are also concerns about how Trump's recent executive order on downsizing the federal workforce could affect seasonal wildland firefighters.",
      "McLaurine Pinover, a spokesperson for the Office of Personnel Management, said firefighters are exempt from the order as public safety workers.",
      "But confusion has caused delays. Ben McLane, a fire crew captain for the U.S. Forest Service in Washington state, said uncertainty over whether firefighters are exempt from the freeze stalled the hiring process for seasonal wildland firefighter positions.",
      "Applicants whom McLane has selected for his crew have received some of the information they need to complete \u2014 such as medical and drug tests and fingerprinting \u2014 in order to be officially hired. But the process has not been completed because human resources lacks agency permission to move forward, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very confused, and we\u2019re not being told anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whose job it is to say that firefighters are an essential aspect for public safety and are exempt from the hiring freeze. But whoever\u2019s job it is, they need to say it, because if they don\u2019t, then there will be situations where people call 911 and there aren\u2019t enough firefighters to go around.\u201d",
      "The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law allowed for some small increases to the 18,700 federal firefighters in 2022, but issues with workforce understaffing and retention remain. The attrition rate for firefighters at the U.S. Forest Service has been 45% over the past four years, a group of Democratic senators said in a second letter to the administration this week.",
      "\u201cWe therefore need to focus on recruitment and retention of this critically important workforce, rather than place more uncertainty within it through an arbitrary freeze,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.",

      "Democrats have been gearing up to grill McMahon on her willingness to execute Trump\u2019s plan, which opponents say would undermine public education. Trump hasn\u2019t said whether he would preserve the core work of the agency, which sends billions of dollars a year to schools, manages a $1.6 trillion student loan portfolio and enforces civil rights in education.",
      "In a letter to McMahon this week, Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Andy Kim said she\u2019ll be asked if she supports Trump\u2019s plan, and what action she will take to carry it out. It asks McMahon for commitments to preserve the department\u2019s student loan operations and civil rights office, among other programs highlighted by the Democrats.",

McMahon has given millions to Trump\u2019s campaigns, and during his first term, he picked her to lead the Small Business Administration.",

      "About a third of state lawmakers are women, garnering 49 out of 140 seats. And of those female legislators, about two dozen have kids under 18, ranging from newborns to teens. But while LeVere Bolling juggled committee meetings, the delegate went into labor. Clerk G. Paul Nardo confirmed she is the first lawmaker granted permission to vote remotely because of childbirth.",
      "\u201cBeing a woman, you feel pressured to just always show up,\u201d she said before giving birth. \u201cI feel compelled because of the issues \u2014 I feel compelled because of the lives that we\u2019re all leading and the tumultuous political climate that we\u2019re living in to be here. I almost feel this guilt or shame for being pregnant during this time, and I shouldn\u2019t, right?\u201d",

      "A Florida man convicted of murdering a husband and wife while the couple's toddler looked on is set to be executed Thursday evening",
      "STARKE, Fla. -- A Florida man convicted of murdering a husband and wife during a fishing trip at a remote farm while the couple's toddler looked on is scheduled to receive a lethal injection Thursday in the state's first execution this year.",
      "The execution of 64-year-old James Dennis Ford is set for 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison under a death warrant signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis in January. It is the first execution scheduled in Florida this year after one execution in the state in 2024 and six in 2023.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court denied Ford's final appeal Wednesday without comment.",
      "Ford was convicted by a jury of murdering Gregory Malnory, 25, and 26-year-old Kimberly Malnory during a fishing outing in 1997 at a remote sod farm in southwest Florida. Ford and Gregory Malnory were coworkers at the Charlotte County farm, court records show.",
      "The couple's 22-month-old daughter witnessed the killings while strapped in a seat in the family's open pickup truck. She survived an 18-hour ordeal before the crime scene was discovered by workers. Investigators said she was found covered in her mother's blood and suffering from numerous mosquito and other insect bites.",
      "Court documents say Ford attacked Gregory Malnory after the group arrived to go fishing, shooting him in the head with a .22-caliber rifle, beating him with an axe-like blunt instrument and finally slitting his throat. Kimberly Malnory was beaten, raped and then shot with the same rifle, authorities say.",
      "Ford initially told investigators that the Malnorys were alive when he left them to go hunting, suggesting someone else killed them. Prosecutors said in a court filing that there was \u201coverwhelming proof that Ford was responsible for the murders and the rape.\u201d",
      "The rifle was found later in a ditch near where Ford's truck had run out of gas and prosecutors presented DNA evidence at his trial connecting him to both slayings. The jury voted 11-1 to recommend the death penalty in the killings, to which the trial judge agreed.",
      "Ford's lawyers have filed numerous appeals since his sentence was imposed, none successful. Most recently the Florida Supreme Court rejected claims that his IQ of about 65 at the time of the murders put him in an intellectually disabled category with a mental age then of about 14 \u2014 therefore ineligible for execution, court documents show.",
      "The court noted that only defendants whose chronological age was under 18 at the time of a crime can be ineligible for the death penalty \u201cand because Ford was 36 at the time of the murders, it is impossible for him to demonstrate that he falls within the ages of exemption.\u201d",
      "It's not clear from court records why these killings happened. Part of Ford's defense was that he suffered from abuse as a child and became an alcoholic like his father, drinking about a case of beer a day along with liquor. He also suffered from untreated diabetes, sometimes leading to blackouts and erratic behavior.",
      "Besides the death penalty, Ford was also convicted of sexual battery with a firearm and child abuse.",
      "If carried out as scheduled, Ford\u2019s execution would be the first in Florida in 2025. One person was put to death in 2024, down from six in 2023, when DeSantis was campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination. During the previous three years, the governor didn\u2019t sign off on any executions.",
      "The Death Penalty Information Center said Florida uses a three-drug cocktail for its lethal injection: a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart.",

      "The storm hitting the region began to ease Thursday night, but dangerous slides can strike even after rain stops, particularly in scorched areas where vegetation that helps keep soil anchored has burned away.",
      "One member of the Los Angeles Fire Department was in the vehicle when it went into the water in Malibu and was able to exit with minor injuries, department spokesperson Erik Scott said on the social platform X.",
      "In Pacific Palisades on Thursday, one intersection of the highway was submerged in at least 3 feet (91 centimeters) of sludge, with some drivers trying to force their way through and police officers pushing one vehicle through the muck. Bulldozers worked to clear the roads not far from where just weeks ago they moved abandoned cars after people fleeing last month's wildfires got stuck in traffic and fled on foot.",
      "In north Altadena, a road near the Eaton Fire burn scar was also covered in several feet of mud, vegetation and trees as a flood of water overcame concrete blocks put in place to prevent such debris flows. The area was mostly deserted.",

      "The West Coast storms are just the latest in a week of bad weather across the U.S. that cut power to tens of thousands.",
      "As the downpour intensified Thursday, the National Weather Service issued flash flood and severe thunderstorm warnings for a swath of eastern Los Angeles County. The rain caused a rockslide and pushed mud onto the road in Malibu Canyon, and a large debris flow left about 8 inches (about 20 centimeters) of mud across a road in the Hollywood Hills.",
      "Southern California reported 1 to 2 inches (about 2.5 to 5 centimeters) of rain in coastal areas and valleys and 3 to 6 inches (about 7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) across the coastal slopes on Thursday, according to the National Weather Service.",

      "Evacuation orders and warnings were issued in areas where hillsides were scarred by the Palisades Fire, the most destructive in LA history. In addition to burning the vegetation that keeps soil in place, the fires also added loose debris to the landscape, including ash, soil and rocks.",
      "Ahead of the storm, officials distributed sandbags, positioned rescue swimmers and told residents to have go-bags ready. Sandbags and temporary concrete barriers were in place across Altadena, where the Eaton Fire destroyed thousands of homes.",

Daoudian said he was grateful that city workers arranged sandbags and concrete barriers in his neighborhood over the past few weeks. \u201cI did not leave the cars on the street because with the mudslide, (they) might go down,\u201d he said.",
      "Near the burn scar for the Airport Fire in Orange County, Trabuco Canyon Road was overtaken by mud and debris, Orange County Public Works posted on social media.",
      "In the San Francisco Bay Area, there were blackouts, small landslides and inundated roadways. Authorities urged people to evacuate Felton Grove, a small community along the central coast, as the San Lorenzo River threatened to top its banks.",
      "In neighboring Nevada, the weather service said it recorded a measurable amount of rain in Las Vegas, ending a streak of 214 days without precipitation.",
      "And in northern Utah, rain and snow created dangerous conditions on mountain roads leading to ski resorts. The state Department of Transportation issued a road safety alert warning of a mix of heavy snow and rain through Friday.",
      "First responders searched every vehicle in a pileup Thursday near Multnomah Falls, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Portland, Oregon, the Multnomah County Sheriff\u2019s Office said. The office initially said more than 100 cars were involved, but the state transportation department later said the number was 20 to 30 vehicles. Oregon State Police said four people were taken to hospitals with minor injuries.",
      "The pileup happened during near-whiteout conditions in the westbound lanes of Interstate 84, authorities said. An SUV caught fire, but its occupants escaped.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has announced legal action against New York officials over a 2019 state law allowing immigrants to obtain state-issued driver\u2019s license regardless of legal status",
      "While U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced legal action Wednesday against New York officials over a 2019 state law allowing immigrants to obtain state-issued driver's licenses regardless of legal status, the Empire State isn't alone in having such a mandate on the books.",
      "At least 19 states and the District of Columbia have enacted similar laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. They're often called \u201cGreen Light\u201d or \u201cDrive Only License\u201d laws and some have been in effect for decades.",
      "The details of these laws can differ by state, including whether a driver's information can be shared with federal authorities - a key sticking point for Bondi, who called New York's law a \u201cgreen light to illegal immigration.\u201d",
      "Here's what you need to know about these special licenses:",
      "As part of President Donald Trump's hardline immigration campaign promises, Bondi announced at her first news conference the federal government planned to sue New York Attorney General Letitia James and Gov. Kathy Hochul over the state's Green Light Law. While the legislation was enacted in part to help improve public safety on the roads and make it easier for the immigrant drivers to get insurance, there's a provision Bondi said requires the state's motor vehicles commissioner to inform license-holders when a federal immigration agency has requested their information.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tipping off an illegal alien and it\u2019s unconstitutional.\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we filed this lawsuit.\u201d",
      "Besides New York, other states with drive-only laws include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, which has the oldest one. It dates back to 1993 and allows people without Social Security numbers to provide alternative documentation to show proof of residence, such as a utility bill or a tax identification number.",
      "Minnesota has one of the most recent laws. In 2023, requirements for applicants to show a legal presence were removed, affecting an estimated 81,000 people. While they're not asked for proof of U.S. citizenship or permanent residence status, applicants must provide identifying documents such as an unexpired foreign passport or a certified birth certificate issued by a foreign jurisdiction.",
      "Under the state law, Minnesota Department of Public Safety officials do not submit the names or personal information of applicants to any immigration law enforcement.",
      "No. While the drive-only license-holders are typically tested on whether they understand the rules of the road, their license can't be used for federal and sometimes state identification purposes, or to vote. In Connecticut, for example, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles makes it clear on its website the license are only to be used for driving purposes and registering a motor vehicle.",
      "Some conservatives have argued that drive-only licenses will encourage illegal immigration while others question whether they could lead to voter fraud in some states.",
      "Former Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, vetoed a bill in 2022 that allowed immigrants without legal status to obtain a state driver's license \u201cbecause it requires the Registry of Motor Vehicles to issue state credentials to people without the ability to verify their identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cConsequently, a standard Massachusetts driver\u2019s license will no longer confirm that a person is who they say they are,\u201d he added in a letter to lawmakers.",
      "The legislature overrode Baker's veto. Later that year, in a midterm election, voters agreed to uphold the measure in a statewide ballot measure."

      "Republicans say the laws put Florida \u2014 long a haven for immigrants \u2014 on the leading edge of conservative-controlled states working to leverage state and local resources for federal immigration enforcement.",
      "As Trump supporters in state capitols across the country race to deliver on the president\u2019s signature issue \u2014 despite concerns from immigrant advocates \u2014 lawmakers in Florida are teeing up a potential fight with the courts as they advance a provision that critics argue is unconstitutional.",
      "Florida\u2019s new legislation mandates the death penalty for immigrants in the U.S. without legal authorization who commit capital offenses such as first degree murder or child rape. It's a provision that goes above and beyond Trump\u2019s executive orders.",
      "DeSantis approved the bills after legislative leaders brokered a compromise that settled a weekslong standoff among the state\u2019s top Republicans over how best to support Trump\u2019s sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "\u201cToday, the Florida Legislature has passed the strongest legislation to combat illegal immigration of any state in the entire country,\u201d DeSantis said before signing the bills and handing a sharpie to each of the legislative leaders standing behind him. \"We are ahead of the curve on ending the illegal immigration crisis.\u201d",
      "But the tensions pitting allies of the president against DeSantis \u2014 who dared to challenge Trump for the nomination \u2014 may not evaporate, as the term-limited governor is widely expected to have presidential aspirations in 2028.",
      "\u201cUltimately this is a win for Donald Trump. Because that\u2019s what this is all about,\u201d said Republican Sen. Joe Gruters, a sponsor of the bills and a key Trump ally.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s still hurt feelings,\u201d Gruters said, \u201con all sides.\u201d",
      "The $298 million would be allocated to hire more than 50 new law enforcement officers focused on immigration, plus grants to equip and train local agencies, bonuses for officers who assist in federal operations, and reimbursement for leasing detention facilities.",
      "The proposal also mandates the death penalty for immigrants who commit capital offenses while in the country illegally. Democrats and civil rights advocates say that provision is unconstitutional, citing previous Supreme Court precedent.",
      "The laws would increase penalties for all crimes committed by immigrants in the country without authorization, and would create a new crime of entering the state after coming to the U.S. illegally.",
      "As part of the compromise, lawmakers did away with a previous proposal to strip the governor of much of his emergency powers on immigration.",
      "A provision that drew bipartisan criticism repeals a law that allows Florida students who are in the country without legal authorization to qualify for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities.",

      "Christianity is by far the largest faith in America, and Christian conservatives have a strong grip on the levers of government",
      "Christianity is by far the largest faith in America, and Christian conservatives have a strong grip on the levers of government. That dominance is leaving many to question why President Donald Trump\u2019s new task force on eradicating anti-Christian bias is needed.",
      "Critics see the task force initiative as unnecessary and pandering to Trump\u2019s base. But some Christian supporters said it is overdue, claiming the Biden administration had discriminated against them through actions and inactions.",
      "The two-year task force, chaired by Attorney General Pam Bondi and composed of Cabinet and other government representatives, is assigned to review and \u201cidentify any unlawful anti-Christian\u201d actions under the Biden administration, change any objectionable policies and recommend steps to rectify any past failures.",
      "Bruce Ledewitz, a law professor at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, criticized the mindset behind the executive order as that of a powerful group claiming victimhood.",
      "The Christian conservative movement \u2014 a core Republican constituency \u2014 now has significant sway on the Supreme Court and in numerous states, Congress and the presidency, Ledewitz said. And still, they declare, \u201cWe are victims,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a struggle for the soul of America,\u201d said Ledewitz, who studies the relationship between constitutional law and religion. \u201cWe call this a culture war, but it\u2019s very deep,\u201d animated by the charge \u201cthat you people, the Democrats, you are not religious, and we are.\u201d",
      "Trump said exactly that at a National Prayer Breakfast gathering on Feb. 6.",
      "\u201cThe opposing side, they oppose religion, they oppose God,\u201d Trump claimed, accusing the previous administration of engaging in \u201cpersecution.\" President Joe Biden, a regular Mass-attending Catholic, often spoke of drawing on the values of his faith and had warm relations with Pope Francis.",
      "But Ryan Bangert, a senior vice president at the conservative legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom, said the task force is overdue.",
      "He said the Biden administration was \u201cdeliberately targeting Christian beliefs through discriminatory policies\u201d on issues such as abortion and gender. These are \u201cnot fringe beliefs\u201d and are shared by other religious groups besides Christians, he said.",
      "Critics said Trump is claiming to see persecution in distorted case descriptions, a calendar coincidence and other situations that, while raising concerns, don\u2019t add up to a pattern.",
      "For example, Trump spoke at the prayer breakfast about how he pardoned a set of abortion protesters. He mischaracterized the case of one woman, who was sentenced to prison at age 75, as being \u201cput in jail because she was praying.\u201d She and co-defendants were sentenced for blockading an abortion clinic in violation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, enacted in the 1990s after violent attacks on abortion providers.",
      "But Bangert said the Biden administration \u201cseverely weaponized\u201d the FACE Act, being far more aggressive against anti-abortion protesters than those who vandalized or threatened other institutions protected by the same act, including churches and pregnancy centers that counsel women not to have abortions. Those incurred a spate of attacks after the Supreme Court, in 2022, overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had made abortion legal nationwide.",
      "A Biden-era Justice Department document lists one case of a conviction of three activists who supported abortion rights and vandalized pregnancy centers. That list otherwise documents numerous prosecutions against anti-abortion protesters who blockaded, threatened or disrupted clinic activities.",
      "The act was \u201csimply deployed to prosecute pro-life advocates who, had they been advocating for any other set of beliefs, would never have been prosecuted by the government,\u201d Bangert said. \u201cYet the Biden administration refused to enforce the FACE Act in cases where pro-life pregnancy centers or churches or synagogues were targeted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops welcomed the creation of the task force.",
      "\u201cWe are hopeful in hearing the news that the Administration is seeking to address anti-Christian bias and incidents, and we stand ready to offer our own insights into how we might ensure that all people are able to fully exercise their religious freedom,\u201d said conference spokesperson Chieko Noguchi.",
      "The conference keeps a running list of reports of vandalism and attacks on churches, reporting at least 366 cases of arson, damaged religious statues and other incidents since 2020. The conference\u2019s religious liberty committee released a report in 2024 citing a bipartisan list of concerns ranging from mandates from the Biden administration regarding gender and abortion to a crackdown by Texas\u2019 Republican attorney general on Catholic organizations serving immigrants.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive order claims that Biden-era equal-employment officials sought to \u201cforce Christians to affirm radical transgender ideology against their faith\u201d and that another department \u201csought to drive Christians out of the foster-care system.\u201d",
      "Trump claimed the FBI in 2023 \u201casserted that traditional Catholics were domestic-terrorism threats and suggested infiltrating Catholic churches as \u2019threat mitigation.\u2019\u201d",
      "The claim emerged from the case of a man of who pleaded guilty to a federal weapons charge and who had spoken of intending to kill Jews and other minorities. He had been attending a church espousing traditionalist Catholic beliefs -- though not in communion with the pope \u2013 where he reportedly sought to recruit others, according to a Justice Department review.",
      "A leaked FBI report cited a purported link between \u201cRacially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists\u201d and \u201cRadical Traditionalist Catholic\u201d adherents.",
      "A Justice Department inspector general subsequently found \u201cthere was no evidence of malicious intent\u201d but that the memo showed a failure to \u201cadhere to analytic tradecraft standards.\u201d",
      "Trump also cited a calendar mashup.",
      "Biden had issued a declaration proclaiming March 31, 2024, as \u201cTransgender Day of Visibility,\u201d which occurs annually on that date. In 2024, that date also happened to be Easter Sunday. While churches have a range of views on LGBTQ+ issues, the proclamation\u2019s timing led to indignant responses from conservative Christian leaders that do not affirm transgender identity.",
      "A White House action focused on a specific religion is not unprecedented. The Biden administration, for example, issued strategy plans to combat antisemitism and Islamophobia.",
      "The secular advocacy group Freedom From Religion Foundation questioned the new task force on the social media platform X, saying \u201cgovernment\u2019s job is to protect everyone\u2019s rights, not give special treatment to one religion.\u201d It questioned whether the task force would \u201cjust push a Christian nationalist agenda.\u201d",
      "Ledewitz said the task force doesn\u2019t violate the constitutional prohibition on the state establishment of a religion \u2014 in theory.",
      "\u201cIf, in practice, it\u2019s going to have government promote Christianity, that violates the Establishment clause,\u201d he said.",
      "Ledewitz cited the Supreme Court's 2017 ruling in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, saying that his state\u2019s Civil Rights Commission showed \u201chostility\u201d to his religious beliefs.",
      "\u201cGovernment is not allowed to be hostile to religion,\u201d Ledewitz said.",
      "However, Ledewitz said there is no case to be made for U.S. Christians suffering systemic persecution.",
      "Though the numbers of people without religion have grown to about 3 in 10 American adults, Christians still make up nearly two-thirds of the population.",
      "Matthew Taylor, Protestant scholar at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and Jewish Studies in Baltimore, said the task force raises concerns. Taylor\u2019s 2024 book, \u201cThe Violent Take It By Force: The Christian Movement That Is Threatening Our Democracy,\u201d recounts the role of charismatic leaders who have been among Trump\u2019s most fervent supporters.",
      "In a majority Christian country, \u201cit\u2019s a bit absurd to claim that there is widespread anti-Christian bias,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhen a majority begins to claim persecution, that is often a license for attacks on minorities.\u201d",

    "summary": "The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.",
      "Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.",
      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",
      "The use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.",
      "Trump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs",
      "UK not planning to hit back at US on steel tariffs",
      "UK signals it will seek US steel tariff exemption",
      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",
      "But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".",
      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",
      "Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".",
      "Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",
      "\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\""

      "Mr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".",
      "\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"",

      "A spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers.

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:23:07 GMT",
    "summary": "They say the US should re-evaluate its cyber-security partnership with the UK unless the \"dangerous\" request is withdrawn.",
    "story": [
      "Two US lawmakers have strongly condemned what they call the UK's \"dangerous\"  and \"shortsighted\" request to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.",
      "Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Andy Biggs have written to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard saying the demand threatens the privacy and security of the US.",
      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the UK government for comment.",
      "\"While the UK has been a trusted ally, the US government must not permit what is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means\", the US politicians wrote.",
      "If the UK does not back down Ms Gabbard should \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing\", they suggest.",
      "What is the UK seeking?",
      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

    "title": "Scientists work on 'superhuman' vision systems for robots",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

    "summary": "Help to fix unsuitable insulation under government schemes only applies to work done since 2022.",
    "story": [
      "Homeowners who say their houses are being destroyed by unsuitable insulation are missing out on measures to fix it as the work was carried out too long ago.",
      "The government has found a \"serious systemic\" issue in homes fitted with insulation under two of its own schemes since 2022 \u2013 and ordered installers to put it right.",
      "But that won't include 93-year-old Margaret Chappell whose work was done in 2021 and now her house is consumed by damp, black mould and crumbling plaster.",
      "The government said it would keep other schemes under review but Mrs Chappell said she and other residents were being ''ignored\".",
      "\"It's as if we don't exist. It's appalling,\" added Mrs Chappell, who has lived in her home in County Durham for 60 years.",
      "She and 153 of her neighbours in the town of Chilton had solid wall insulation fitted after Durham County Council advised them to take advantage of a free government scheme.",
      "They were told the work would help make their homes warmer and lower their energy bills. But Mrs Chappell, who suffers from chronic asthma, said that since then, damp has consumed her living room.",
      "Her wallpaper has peeled off and the plaster behind it is saturated and crumbling.",
      "\"I don't want to be sitting here, breathing in this dust,\" she said.",
      "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DSENZ) said homeowners affected should contact the installer or the installer's scheme provider using the TrustMark complaints process.",
      "More than three million homes in the UK have had insulation fitted under government schemes including 260,000 properties which have had solid wall insulation.",
      "In October, the BBC told the story of 84-year-old Tormuja Khatun from Luton whose house with unsuitable solid wall insulation had mushrooms growing on the walls and dry rot feeding off the floor joists.",
      "Since then the house became so dangerous to live in she had to move out. Her family has been warned it will cost more than \u00a3100,000 to fix.",
      "Mrs Khatun's insulation was fitted in 2022 so in theory should be covered by the government's promise of help - but they still don't know when the work will start and who will pick up the bill.",
      "Not long after this BBC report, the government ordered an audit by the independent organisation Trustmark of more than 1,000 properties that have had solid wall insulation. It found that in half of the homes audited the work had not been done to the required standard.",
      "The Minister for Energy Consumers, Miatta Fahnbulleh MP, told Parliament last month that the audit had found ''serious systemic'' problems. She said installers would be required to fix and pay for any problems.",
      "The energy regulator Ofgem is now trying to establish how widespread the problems are and has written to 65,000 households that have had solid wall insulation since 2022 under the government's ECO4 and GBIS schemes.",
      "But because the homes in Chilton were done under a different government programme, called the Local Authority Delivery Scheme, there is currently no plan to contact residents.",
      "The government said it was ''currently confident the quality of works under the Local Authority Delivery scheme was high'' but it would keep the situation under review.",
      "'Catastrophic scheme'",
      "Building surveyor, David Walter, has been inspecting insulated properties for 25 years. He assessed the damage at several of the homes in Chilton and said ''poor design and poor workmanship'' had led to rain penetration which was causing the damp and mould.",
      "In Mr Walter's view the properties were unsuitable for solid wall insulation and said it would have to be removed from all of the properties. He warned this could cost tens of thousands of pounds per home to fix.",
      "He said the cost \"could actually exceed the market value'' of each house and added ''it just demonstrates what a catastrophic scheme it's been.''",
      "'Somebody needs to act'",
      "Susan Haslam said she has been fighting to get the damage repaired to her late parents', Bob and Maureen's Chilton home ever since they died three years ago.",
      "She said her father worried about the damp as he cared for her mother, who had dementia.",
      "She said the stress had prevented her family from being able to grieve properly for their parents, who saw the house \"as part of their legacy,\" after working for decades.",
      "\"We don't want to let them down, we want it to be sorted for them and for us,\" she said. \"Somebody is responsible and they need to act.\"",
      "The company hired by Durham County Council to do the work on Mrs Chappell's house, Tolent, went bust before the installations were completed.",
      "Tolent sub-contracted the work to another firm, Westdale North Ltd, which says it is \"still on site, and working on issues that have arisen.\"",
      "It added that it was doing the work \"as a goodwill gesture although it may not legally be required to do so\" adding \"the care and consideration we have for residents is a core part of our service.\"",
      "The company said the work had been signed off by the Council and Tolent before it went bust, adding: \"Some issues that were raised with Tolent were not communicated to us, due to them no longer being in business.\"",
      "Durham County Council's head of planning and housing, Michael Kelleher said it had been \"a complex situation, with the collapse of Tolent causing delays outside of our control and we understand residents' frustrations.\"",
      "Mr Kelleher said the council has set up an email address for concerned residents, arranged for inspections to take place at affected properties and provided Westdale North with a list of issues raised by residents.",
      "\"Westdale North has carried out extensive work to resolve the issues and we will continue to liaise with them to ensure any outstanding problems are rectified,\" he added.",
      "DSENZ said it was planning to overhaul the current system.",
      "\"The government has inherited a situation where there are several organisations with different roles and responsibilities, producing a fragmented and confusing system of protections for people wanting to make their homes more energy efficient,\" it added."

    "summary": "The US president ordered his staff to develop a response to countries with trade policies he says are unfair.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.",
      "In outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.",
      "While big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days.",
      "Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April.",
      "Trump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.",
      "\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".",
      "\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"",
      "As well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports.",
      "Trump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.",
      "Still, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"",
      "In recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.",
      "Ahead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".",
      "\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good.",
      "Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "Historically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium.",
      "The US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.",
      "In setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US.",
      "The White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.",
      "But officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax.",
      "Those kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK.",
      "Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus.",
      "\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said.",
      "What impact could tariffs have on the economy?",
      "Thursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.",
      "He also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March.",
      "Shares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced.",
      "John Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".",
      "But he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy.",
      "\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.",
      "However, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves.",
      "He does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation.",
      "\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said.",
      "He noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.",
      "\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.",
      "Trump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.",
      "\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"",
      "But surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households.",
      "A recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats.",
      "\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 06:03:08 GMT",
    "summary": "Businesses want a review of the regulations that govern what Heathrow Airport can charge.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines and hoteliers say Heathrow's funding model should be reformed before any investment is made in the proposed third runway.",
      "Businesses want a fundamental review of the regulations set by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) that govern what Heathrow can charge. They say the current model makes Heathrow the most expensive airport in the world.",
      "If changes are not made, businesses say the third runway will not happen as it will be too expensive.",
      "The CAA said it would \"carefully consider\" conducting a review of Heathrow's economic regulatory model.",
      "A Heathrow source said that the airport management had already told airlines and the government that it would propose to look at a different, longer-term regulatory model for a third runway.",
      "But, as with other goods that consumers buy, those who use a service or product have to pay for the cost of providing or producing it as is the case today.",
      "Surinder Arora is the chair of Arora group which owns 16 hotels and lots of land around the airport. He is pro-expansion but he has his doubts it will happen.",
      "He told BBC London that Heathrow is overcharging for many items.",
      "For example, he says he pays 2.62p a unit for a unit of water at the Renaissance Hotel which is outside the Heathrow Airport boundary.",
      "At his Hilton hotel next to Terminal 2, within the boundary, he pays Heathrow Airport a lot more - 23.27p a unit. That high price is passed on to his customers.",
      "He gives other examples including three oak trees being chopped down and the airlines being charged \u00a376,000.",
      "A smoking shelter which he says would cost normally \u00a320-30,000, he says cost Heathrow \u00a31.1m.",
      "Sources at Heathrow dispute those figures.",
      "But he says the regulatory model allows Heathrow to charge what they want for many services, such as water, parking or construction, as they are a monopoly.",
      "\"The current monopoly at Heathrow doesn't only vastly overcharge passengers on aviation fees but also on their parking and a variety of other services as it continues to stand out as the most expensive airport in the world by a long way,\" says Mr Arora.",
      "\"We are delighted to be working with the airlines to ask the CAA to look more carefully at the regulatory issues which lead to such high prices and seize the opportunity for competition to improve Heathrow's offer to passengers.\"",
      "Most expensive for airport charges",
      "He told me without change the third runway would not happen.",
      "\"If it stays the same then it won't happen,\" he says.",
      "\"If you look at the last two decades they have never delivered a project on time and on budget.",
      "\"What they're looking at spending is \u00a362bn plus. And the current value of the airport is \u00a320bn.",
      "\"So what they're saying is we will increase the passenger numbers by 50% but we want you to pay three times than what the value is today. How can any business survive that?",
      "\"If they just carry on the same model, everyone else will end up paying for it.\"",
      "Nigel Wicking, chief executive of Heathrow Airline Operators Committee, says all of the costs are passed on to travellers.",
      "\"Heathrow is rapidly falling behind other major airports around the globe both in facilities and service to airline customers, while having the unenviable accolade of being the most expensive for airport charges. This cannot continue,\" he says.",
      "\"The airline community want to offer travellers, to and from the UK, a great experience through Heathrow and we want growth, also avoiding the disproportionate costs we too often see by Heathrow Airport Limited.\"",
      "Heathrow expects third runway take offs in 10 years",
      "What's the plan for a third runway at Heathrow Airport?",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "The government has said it will back a third runway if it can be expanded within noise, pollution and carbon limits.",
      "This week, Heathrow Airport said it would be applying for planning permission by the summer.",
      "The Heathrow source said it made little sense to suggest that passengers would have new runways and terminal buildings for free as they would require investments over and above current regular investment levels.",
      "Heathrow is keen to run a transparent process and work in partnership with airlines, the regulator and ministers to put in place a model that delivers the benefits of expansion for the UK as quickly as possible - including the lower airfares that consumers can expect as a result of new capacity being unlocked.",
      "It also pointed out as part of the settlement airlines must agree to approve of all spending and the regulator makes sure it is value for money.",
      "Selina Chadha, group director for consumers and markets at the UK CAA, said: \"We have received a submission asking us to conduct a review of Heathrow's economic regulatory model, and we will carefully consider it as part of our commitment to effective regulation.",
      "\"We will always focus on delivering in the interests of consumers, while supporting growth, investment, and efficiency.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 04:18:52 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump and Modi, who share warm personal ties, met in the shadow of trade tensions complicating US-India relations.",
    "story": [
      "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas.",
      "Modi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.",
      "While both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\".",
      "The Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US.",
      "At a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.",
      "\"Maga plus Miga...[is a] Mega partnership for prosperity\".",
      "Trump also added that India would be \"purchasing a lot of our oil and gas\" in an effort to close the trade deficit between both countries.",
      "\"They need it. And we have it,\" Trump said.",
      "With India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC.",
      "\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said.",
      "However, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said.",
      "\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit.",
      "Trump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets.",
      "The two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".",
      "Modi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US.",
      "Last week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday.",
      "Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.",
      "Shortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.",
      "He acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".",
      "Trump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.",
      "\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"",
      "The White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.",
      "The document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.",
      "\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said.",
      "\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"",
      "Trump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic.",
      "He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days.",
      "Earlier this week, he removed exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminium tariffs."

    "story": [
      "The UK government has given its strongest signal yet that it will seek exemptions from tariffs being threatened on British steel entering the US.",
      "US President Donald Trump has announced 25% taxes on steel entering the country, meaning American businesses face having to pay more to import the metal.",
      "But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC that the UK had a strong case to avoid the border taxes, given the amounts Britain exported to the US were small in comparison to other countries and because the steel was used in areas such as defence.",
      "Trump has previously said the tariffs will be enforced on 12 March \"without exceptions or exemptions\".",
      "The government has said it would not retaliate immediately to new measures announced this week, despite many in the steel industry calling on Britain to join the European Union and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Reynolds acknowledged there was a global oversupply of steel and aluminium but said he would argue to the Trump administration that the UK was not the problem.",
      "His comments also suggested that the UK would be reluctant to join potential retaliation by the EU to any further tariffs imposed by the US, adding that \"the UK national interest was best served by free trade\".",
      "Tariffs are paid by companies importing goods from overseas, not by the foreign companies selling the products.",
      "There are concerns that the measures could lead to a rise in inflation if the company buying the goods passes on the cost of the tariff by charging their customers more.",
      "In some cases, the company could decide to absorb the costs themselves, or simply to reduce imports, which would hit foreign exporters - and in the UK's case, British steelmakers exporting to the US.",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson declined to say whether Trump was wrong to impose the tariffs.",
      "The threat of trade tariffs has been noted to have created uncertainty for UK businesses, which are set to be hit by higher taxes from April.",
      "Reynolds conceded that tax rises on businesses announced in Budget had been \"challenging\" for firms of whom the government was \"asking a lot\".",
      "Appearing before a gathering of business leaders near Kings Cross, Reynolds announced new guidance for the competition watchdog to be more agile, speedy, and less risk averse.",
      "The meeting came after the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority [CMA] was recently forced out by ministers over concerns it had not been sufficiently focused on economic growth.",
      "The business secretary hinted the government could take further action to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses.",
      "\"I think we have to genuinely ask ourselves, have we got the right number of regulators?\" Reynolds said."

    "story": [
      "Questions have been raised about the accuracy of the chancellor's online CV, and the use of expenses while working at a bank, in the wake of a BBC News investigation.",
      "Rachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.",
      "It was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter.",
      "The initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "BBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP",
      "In a brief interview with a reporter, Sir Keir was asked about Rachel Reeves's CV.",
      "The prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".",
      "He said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "Rachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.",
      "The chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.",
      "However, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.",
      "They said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.",
      "Speaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Reeves's profile was updated on Thursday morning just before the BBC broke the news, to reflect that the chancellor left the Bank of England in March 2006",
      "The rest of the profile was subsequently edited to clarify the dates she worked at HBOS.",
      "A photo taken in March 2006 shows her with other HBOS staff at the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual lunch.",
      "A former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.",
      "In a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"",
      "In a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\"",
      "She said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.",
      "The claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".",
      "As she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "Last year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.",
      "Reeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.",
      "She stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.",
      "The chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.",
      "In fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".",
      "The bank was undergoing restructuring at the time of Reeves's departure and a spokesman for the chancellor said she had taken voluntary redundancy.",
      "A compromise agreement, now known as a settlement agreement, is a legal document between an employer and employee which HBOS used when senior managers were made redundant.",
      "Reeves was allowed to continue using a company car for six months, according to her spokesman.",
      "She then spent a year campaigning ahead of the May 2010 general election without seeking further employment.",
      "The MP for Leeds West and Pudsey has previously faced accusations that she has embellished her online CV.",
      "Her LinkedIn profile was changed last year to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",
      "It had previously claimed she worked as an economist at the bank but she instead held a management role in the bank's Customer Relations department, which dealt with complaints.",
      "In November, several MPs raised the row in the House of Commons while putting questions to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.",
      "The prime minister's spokeswoman also faced questions at that time, with journalists asking if Sir Keir expected members of his Cabinet to tell the truth on their CV.",
      "The spokeswoman said the row related to \"the chancellor's time before she was the chancellor\".",
      "\"The prime minister is very clear that what is most important is having a chancellor who is able to balance the books and who is able to be straight with the public and restore the public finances,\" she added.",

      "Two major lenders launched mortgage deals on Thursday with interest rates of less than 4%, as competition picks up in the sector.",
      "The prospect of further cuts in the base rate by the Bank of England has given mortgage providers confidence to reduce their own rates.",
      "But the attention-grabbing sub-4% deals by Santander and Barclays will not be available to all borrowers, particularly first-time buyers, and may come with a hefty fee.",
      "The return of such deals might prompt other lenders to follow suit after a period of tepid competition.",

      "The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "That means a higher monthly bill for many homeowners on their next renewal, but there are signs that the rate they could pay is on its way down.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said the interest-rate setting committee expected to be able to cut rates further \"but we will have to judge meeting by meeting, how far and how fast\".",

      "Eligible borrowers for the sub-4% rates will need a 40% deposit, which will shut off these deals to many borrowers, especially some first-time buyers.",
      "They may also have a relatively large fee, so borrowers will need to check whether the overall value works for them.",
      "More demand for homes from buyers could be generated if mortgage rates fall for a prolonged period.",

      "The UK economy unexpectedly grew in the final three months of last year following a boost to the construction and services sectors.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",
      "'People don't have the money'",
      "Sushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.",
      "\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"",
      "She said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.",
      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",
      "\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"",
      "Following the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.",
      "\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".",
      "She also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK.",
      "\"Working people and businesses are already paying for her choices with ever rocketing taxes, hundreds of thousands of job cuts and business confidence plummeting,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said the chancellor's Budget was to blame for \"pitiful economic growth\".",
      "\"Her complete pig's ear of a jobs tax will hammer small businesses, the backbone of our economy.\"",

      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",

      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",

      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",
      "TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",

      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",

    "summary": "The bank ditches a policy that stopped it acting on flotations for firms with an all male, all white board.",
    "story": [
      "Goldman Sachs' vice chair has said the bank ditched an internal diversity rule that barred it from advising all male, all white boards on company flotations because it was no longer needed.",
      "The investment bank had pledged that it would only help a business sell its shares on a stock exchange if it had two board members that satisfied diversity requirements, one of whom had to be a woman.",
      "But Richard Gnodde told the BBC: \"That policy was put in place to try and drive a change in behaviour and I think that's happened.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging interview, he also said the UK government needed to get on and start infrastructure projects now.",
      "Goldman Sachs introduced its diversity policy on boards in 2020, initially mandating that companies who wanted to float had to have one diverse member, before increasing it to two people.",
      "Mr Gnodde said: \"I think what is important is that you have a diversity of views on that board and if you look at these companies they've all embraced diversity, it's moved along.",
      "\"I think it has served its purpose.\"",
      "According to think tank The Conference Board, although US boards are \"more diverse than ever\", there was a \"marked slowdown\" in racial diversity hiring on boards between 2022 and 2024.",
      "Among the 500 largest US firms, the share of non-white directors was 26% and the share of women directors was 34% in 2024, according to the think tank.",
      "In December last year, a US federal appeals court ruled that Nasdaq, the stock market index, did not have the authority to impose rules requiring companies to have women and minorities or LGBTQ+ people on their boards or explain why they did not.",

      "A number of companies have since rowed back on diverse hiring programs, including Google and Meta, the firm that owns Instagram and Facebook.",
      "Asked whether firms were stepping back from policies around diversity because of the Trump White House, Mr Gnodde said: \"I can only speak for ourselves, I don't think that's the case.",
      "\"Our ambitions are to continue to take things forward and frankly to go much further than we have been.\"",
      "'Animal spirits'",
      "However, he conceded that uncertainty caused by Trump's policy on trade tariffs was weighing on companies' \"animal spirits\" and their appetite for investment.",
      "\"I think right now, the mood is on the margin [is] a little tempered, because people are uncertain about exactly what the policy outcome will be and exactly what the impacts will be,\" said Mr Gnodde.",
      "Trump initially said he would impose 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. However, he then paused them against Canada and Mexico for 30 days.",
      "Since then, the president has subsequently announced he would impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium entering the US, provoking furious responses from the likes of Canada and the European Union.",
      "Start building",
      "Looking at the UK, Mr Gnodde urged the government to get going on infrastructure  projects sooner rather than later.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves recently announced her backing for a third runway at Heathrow as well as expanding Luton and Gatwick airports, and building a \"growth corridor\" between Oxford and Cambridge.",
      "However, these projects are not expected to be completed for a number of years.",
      "The government has made growing the economy a key policy but UK growth has slowed, according to official figures.",
      "Mr Gnodde said: \"The long range projects are very interesting. We need to put them in place but they're going to take a long time.\"",
      "He added: \"Let's find some infrastructure builds that we need to do, whether it's in the energy sector, whether it's in transportation, improving the road network, something on energy transition.",
      "\"These plans all sit on the Treasury's desk. Why don't we put them out to tender, get the private sector to bid on terms that will be attractive to the private sector, and you will see competition.\"",
      "In a report into boosting small businesses in Britain, released on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said: \"If there are two things we know from the first six months of a new administration in the UK, it is that growth is the pressing national mission and unlocking it is perhaps the greatest challenge that consecutive governments have faced.\"",
      "Mr Gnodde said Labour had \"sent a strong message on the competition front\" after it recently ousted the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority.",

      "A spokesperson added a Next stylist and product image manager met the model in person and \"did not have any concerns about her health\".",
      "In its ruling, the ASA acknowledged the model's face \"did not appear to be gaunt and her arms, while slim, did not display any protruding bones\".",
      "But it said: \"Because the pose, camera angle and styling in the ad investigated strongly emphasised the slimness of the model's legs, we considered that the ad gave the impression that the model was unhealthily thin.\"",

      "Heathrow Airport has confirmed a multi-billion pound investment plan to expand two of its terminals ahead of submitting proposals for a third runway to the government this summer.",
      "Heathrow Airport chief executive Thomas Woldbye said he wants planes to take off from its new third runway before the end of the next parliament, which could be ten years or fewer.",
      "The plans, which will be paid for with private cash, come after Chancellor Rachel Reeves backed a third runway at the UK's largest airport last month as part of efforts to grow the UK economy.",
      "Reeves' decision to back Heathrow's expansion has angered campaigners and members of her party who oppose it on environmental grounds.",
      "During his speech at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, Mr Woldbye signed a pact to use UK steel to build new infrastructure.",
      "He also revealed funding to increase capacity at terminals two and five, and plans to reconfigure the airfield and improve bus connections.",
      "The commitment to use UK-made steel comes amid concern in the industry over the impact of tariffs being placed on imports of the metal to the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "The US import taxes could lead to excess steel being offloaded to the UK at cheaper prices, with the potential to undercut domestic businesses.",
      "While the detailed plans for a third runway at the UK's largest airport, are yet to be finalised, the construction of terminal five, which opened in 2008, required some 80,000 tonnes of steel.",
      "The expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial and faces opposition from environmental groups, many politicians, as well as nearby local authorities and residents.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "\"A third runway at Heathrow can not be a choice between economic growth and the environment,\" Mr Woldbye said.",
      "He added that it was a \"collective mission\" to grow Heathrow \"responsibly within environmental boundaries.\"",
      "The aviation industry is a source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and it's already under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr Woldbye outlined the expansion plan ahead of the new runway, which will see upgrades to terminal buildings to \"enhance passenger experience and improve resilience and sustainability\".",
      "\"This privately funded programme will upgrade existing infrastructure while laying the groundwork for a third runway, boosting UK investment and economic growth, with tangible benefits felt this year,\" he said.",
      "The chancellor has said expansion at Heathrow is \"badly needed\" and could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "Zengwei An, chief executive of British Steel - which has the only facility in the country to make primary steel - said its workers in Scunthorpe and Teeside had a \"distinguished history of supplying world-class products into projects like Heathrow's expansion\".",
      "Gareth Stace, director-general of the steel industry body UK Steel, added that Heathrow committing to using domestically-made steel was a \"major vote of confidence in UK steelmaking and British businesses full stop\".",
      "Heathrow's third runway can be built in 10 years, Reeves says",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "Some have argued that it will take much longer than a decade for a third runway to become reality.",
      "A formal planning process has to take place, which could take between 18 months and two years. Any judicial review of the plan could take another year and a half, while actually building it could take about seven years.",
      "Reeves has said she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" before 2029 and planes to start using the runway by 2035, but Mr Woldbye has previously warned the project would take years and need \"Churchillian resolve\" to deliver.",
      "In his speech, the Heathrow boss said the airport's expansion plans will be carried out with \"strict environmental safeguards\"",
      "\"This project can only go ahead if we meet the rules on noise, air quality and carbon... it's as simple as that,\" he added.",
      "\"I want to assure you that we are committed to listening and working with our local communities to provide them with the certainty they deserve, ending years of doubt.\"",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and provides a key avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",

      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit. A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000."

      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",

      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "story": [
      "Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.",
      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",
      "Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.",
      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",
      "\"I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story\u2026 and often the people who have the least give the most,\" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers.",
      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",
      "She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as \"in need\". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.",
      "She argues the participant is being \"lured\" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.",
      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him \"feel weird\".",
      "Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.",

    "title": "Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump has proposed a sweeping set of tariffs. Does this mark the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",

      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

    "title": "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",
      "The Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has been outspoken in underlining the need for immigrants, describing their contribution to the economy as \"fundamental\".",
      "The European Commission has forecast that Spain will continue to lead growth among the bloc's big economies this year and remain ahead of the EU average. However, challenges are looming on the horizon.",
      "The heavy reliance on tourism - and a growing backlash against the industry by local people - is one concern.",
      "Another is Spain's vast public debt, which is higher than the country's annual economic output.",
      "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros warns that this is \"an imbalance that we need to correct, not just because the EU's new fiscal norms demand it, but because it could cause financial instability\".",
      "In addition, a housing crisis has erupted across the country, leaving millions of Spaniards struggling to find affordable accommodation.",
      "With an uncertain and deeply polarised political landscape, it is difficult for S\u00e1nchez's minority government to tackle such problems. But, while it attempts to resolve these conundrums, Spain is enjoying its status as the motor of European growth.",

    "summary": "What happens next has implications for the expiry of almost 600 similar PFI deals across England.",
    "story": [
      "Schools across Stoke-on-Trent are caught up in an increasingly bitter row over repairs, with some telling the BBC they've had to fight to get work done while paying \"astronomical\" charges over 25 years.",
      "The city's schools are all locked into a multi-million-pound Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract, meaning they pay a company to keep their buildings in good condition.",
      "The agreement is due to end in October, when schools fear the private firm will walk away, leaving behind a huge repair bill for work not completed.",
      "BBC News has been investigating the row for more than a year, visiting multiple schools in the city, using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and analysing documents.",
      "We can exclusively reveal 42 of the 88 schools involved are now withholding payments to the contract. The investigation also found:",
      "35 of those schools received a letter from Stoke-on-Trent City Council threatening them with legal action in JanuarySchools were also told at the end of January that there was not enough money left to complete all the repairs required before the contract endsNone of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",
      "35 of those schools received a letter from Stoke-on-Trent City Council threatening them with legal action in January",
      "Schools were also told at the end of January that there was not enough money left to complete all the repairs required before the contract ends",
      "None of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",
      "The contract was signed in 2000 between Stoke-on-Trent City Council and a firm called Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited (TSSL). It uses multinational company Equans to maintain the facilities.",
      "The contract is the largest of its kind in England and will be among the first PFI deals in the country to expire. After the deal ends, the private company will have no further liability.",
      "What happens next has implications for the expiry of almost 600 similar deals covering schools and hospitals across England.",
      "Stoke City Council said its priority was to get the schools handed over \"safe, warm and dry\", while the main contractor engaged under the PFI contract, Equans, said the buildings had been well maintained.",
      "At Our Lady and St Benedict primary, more than half the children are from families on the very lowest incomes. When the BBC visited the school last month, part of one classroom was cordoned off with hazard tape because plaster was falling off the walls. There was a hole in the ceiling and the wall was damp to touch.",
      "The BBC has seen evidence the school has spent years chasing this and other repairs, which under the terms of the maintenance contract have to be done through Equans.",
      "Head teacher Sarah Clowes says the school's floors and windows are among almost 300 issues staff have identified - but the heating is her biggest headache.",
      "A new boiler, fitted under the contract last summer, broke down when the first cold snap arrived, and the youngest children had to be sent home for three days because the building was so cold. Pupils in Year 6 remained at school, but had to wear their coats during lessons. When the heating broke down again in January, the school was unable to open and all the pupils had to stay at home.",
      "Since the BBC approached Equans for comment last week, the damp plaster has been removed and repairs have begun. The school told us despite further repairs the heating is still not working in every classroom.",
      "A few miles away, at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy, the exterior render on the building is stained green with damp and is coming away in places. Inside, there is a huge stain where water comes through from the roof to the ground floor.",
      "The BBC has also seen evidence of months of delays to fix three pumps that supply the school with water. Only one is working - and if it breaks the school says it will have to close because there would be no clean water for taps and toilets.",
      "BBC News contacted Equans about the issue and the school has since been assured the pumps will be replaced during a school holiday.",
      "Ian Beardmore, chief executive of Newman Catholic Collegiate - a group of six primaries and one secondary in the Stoke PFI contract - describes the charges his schools have been paying for the past 25 years as \"astronomical\".",
      "He says the annual maintenance fee for a plug socket installed in one primary school staff room was \u00a3400, and when he asked for the socket to be removed the school was charged \u00a3500.",
      "Mr Beardmore says there are \u00a31.8m of repairs that need to be carried out across his seven schools, which have been identified in expiry surveys carried out to assess their condition as the maintenance contract nears its end. Some work has already been classed as too expensive or not essential, he says.",
      "\"There's no money, there's no will to do it, and there's no time in order to put these things into place,\" he says. \"It's going to leave us severely out of pocket - and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.\"",
      "The BBC has seen a letter, sent by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to all 88 schools in the Stoke contract, saying it \"remains concerned\" the PFI company \"may not have sufficient funding available to them to complete all of the handback works\".",
      "It will need to \"reprioritise\" work not already agreed, the letter continues, and target repairs which will leave all schools \"in a safe, warm and dry condition\" by the end of the contract.",
      "Schools have told the BBC it is not clear how these priorities will be agreed or by whom. The council subsequently said schools would be consulted.",
      "Contract makes school pay thousands to cut grass",
      "Cold and leaky school 'causing pupils stress'",
      "Investors make \u00a3140m from PFI deals",
      "When something isn't fixed quickly, or part of a school is out of use, these maintenance contracts allow for money to be held back from the private contractor. In this contract, Stoke-on-Trent City Council is responsible for making sure that happens.",
      "However, the BBC investigation suggests little money has been held back, despite concerns from the schools.",
      "The BBC analysed 25 years of published financial accounts for the PFI company TSSL and found \u00a3416,000 had been declared as deductions from the contract since 2014. In most years this was less than 1% of the fees.",
      "Using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, BBC News also found that no money has been passed on to schools for contract failures over the last 25 years.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council told us it was still working through these payments, and they would be paid to schools before October.",
      "The BBC shared its data with Ian Dennison, whose consultancy firm Inscyte is advising the schools fighting to get repairs done in Stoke. His company has worked on PFI school contracts across England.",
      "Mr Dennison told the BBC the level of deductions in Stoke were \"shockingly low\" compared with similar contracts for PFI schools across England.",
      "Time is running out for repairs to be carried out in Stoke's PFI schools and Mr Dennison is not confident the buildings will be handed back in a satisfactory condition.",
      "\"We believe that there's a really serious problem about to emerge around what works can be completed in time,\" Mr Dennison says.",
      "Putting buildings right at the end of contract is part of what the high yearly payments in PFI are intended to ensure.",
      "Inscyte says the expiry surveys carried out for Stoke City Council and TSSL show the total repairs would cost millions.",
      "The use of PFI deals increased significantly under Tony Blair's Labour government as a way of investing in public buildings without the government borrowing money up front. Under the deals, long-term agreements between the private and public sector were made.",
      "In Stoke, the contract mainly covered maintaining existing school buildings, with a bit of new build. Elsewhere, completely new schools were built under PFI.",
      "In 2018, the Conservative government scrapped the controversial PFI model after growing concerns it did not provide value for public money. But around 570 PFI contracts, including many to maintain and update school and hospital buildings, remained in place. Many are now nearing their end.",
      "Five years ago the National Audit Office (NAO) - which scrutinises value for public money - warned of a risk of schools and hospitals being handed back in a poor condition if the final stage of these maintenance contracts wasn't properly managed.",
      "As contracts begin to wind down, the NAO said there is a disincentive for the private companies to spend money before they hand over responsibility for maintaining the buildings to public bodies.",
      "In order to avoid this happening the government says \"expiry health checks\" should be carried out on buildings.",
      "In response to an FOI request, the Cabinet Office confirmed expiry health checks were carried out on Stoke's PFI schools in March 2021 and March 2024.",
      "Their condition was given the second worst rating, \"amber/red\", which means \"major additional work\" was needed.",
      "The BBC asked the council, Equans and TSSL to comment on its findings.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council said there had been a \"large amount of investment to maintain and improve these schools over the last 25 years\", which it claims means they are in a better condition than many schools elsewhere.",
      "The council said recent high inflation had made repairs more expensive, but it would not agree to responsibility for buildings being handed back unless standards set out in the contract were met.",
      "The council said more than half the work by value had been completed, and it was drawing up plans in case not all the work can be finished.",
      "Equans said it has been \"committed to ensuring Stoke's schools have been well-maintained throughout the 25 years of the contract\". It said an average of 28,000 jobs have been completed across the schools every year, with 93% of planned and preventative tasks being completed on time and, for the rest of this year, \"a busy schedule of work for the school holidays was planned\".",
      "Some work on the damaged render at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy is now due to be carried out over Easter, the BBC understands.",
      "Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited said the schools had been maintained \"in accordance with the contract\", adding that many of the school buildings were relatively old when it took over responsibility.",
      "It said \"all parties are working together to deliver the maintenance works by the contract expiry date\", adding that the schools were involved in the sign-off process and it was unaware of any dispute between the council and the schools and \"unaware of widespread issues with quality\".",

    "story": [
      "A visually-impaired student has written to MPs to highlight what she describes as the poor delivery of Disabiled Students' Allowance (DSA) at her university.",
      "Tilly Gerra, who was born with under-developed eyes, is studying multimedia journalism at the University of Northampton and requires support, including orienteering assistance, a braille printer and note-takers, to help her navigate the campus.",
      "Despite being awarded DSA in September, the 20-year-old from Milton Keynes said she had encountered significant issues including being assigned a guide unfamiliar with the campus layout, uncertainty over the provision of other support services, and being overcharged for her laptop.",
      "The Student Loans Company (SLC,) said it apologised to Ms Gerra for the issues she had experienced in receiving her DSA support.",
      "\"I am in a state of constant stress and have been struggling to access my course material because of the immense difficulties I have faced accessing the equipment and support services the government's Disabiled Students' Allowance entitles me to,\" said Ms Gerra.",
      "DSA is intended to help students with disabilities, long-term health conditions, or mental health issues by covering study-related costs.",
      "This includes funding for specialist equipment, non-medical helpers, and additional travel expenses.",
      "Ms Gerra only started receiving the support she was entitled to on 27 January - four months after her course began.",
      "She said she had been phoning Student Finance England several times a week to try to resolve the delays, describing the process as \"stressful\" and \"exhausting\".",
      "She also expressed frustration with the private companies responsible for providing DSA support, saying they were slow to respond, dismissive of her concerns, and lacked adequate training.",

      "\"My assessor didn't know a lot about visual impairment,\" she said.",
      "\"They should liaise with universities to begin with to find out a rough estimate of how many hours of support a student needs because different courses require different aspects of support.",

    "title": "Should teacher numbers drop as school rolls fall?",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 12:10:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Pupil numbers are set to fall by 90,000 by 2040, but ministers want to maintain school staffing.",
    "story": [
      "Long-term plans need to be drawn up for Scotland's schools to reflect falling pupil numbers, a think tank has said.",
      "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there could be 90,000 fewer pupils in the country's classrooms by 2040 - and suggested that teacher numbers could be cut as a result.",
      "The group said this could eventually free up \u00a3500m per year, but the government has flatly rejected the idea.",
      "Teaching unions have hit out too, with the EIS saying cutting teacher numbers \"lacks any educational rationale\" and the NASUWT calling it a \"false economy\" that would damage life chances and Scotland's future prosperity.",
      "But when you consider the falling birth rate and demographic changes alongside the need to get the maximum benefit out of every pound spent on services, is it time to talk about teacher numbers?",
      "School staffing is a frequent topic of dispute between politicians - usually in terms of demands for more of them, not fewer.",
      "The SNP pledged in its 2021 manifesto to increase teacher numbers by 3,500.",
      "So when it was revealed in December that the figure had actually fallen, opposition leaders were quick to give the first minister a hard time about it.",
      "John Swinney pledged to get teacher numbers back to 2023 levels, and keeping them there is the government's new goal.",
      "But pupil numbers are already starting to plateau, and are projected to drop sharply over the coming decades.",
      "That's why the Institute for Fiscal Studies argues that perhaps it would be OK to allow teacher numbers to go down in line with that, rather than holding them at 2023 levels.",
      "The government has flatly rejected the report's conclusions.",
      "But much of the picture it paints is actually pretty positive.",
      "The IFS underlines that class sizes in Scotland are smaller than those elsewhere in the UK - averaging about 13 pupils per teacher, compared with 17 to 19 pupils per teacher down south.",
      "Spending per pupil is also rising, and is the highest in the UK - 20% higher than it is in England.",
      "But on both counts that can be explained in part by the number of pupils rising far more sharply south of the border. Scotland is set to have the opposite problem.",
      "The stickiest issue for the government is that these smaller class sizes and higher spending hasn't necessarily led to notably better outcomes.",
      "Scotland's struggle in international comparisons of school performance has been well documented. There has been a long-term decline in reading, maths and science, and Covid has hardly helped.",
      "The gap in attainment between pupils from more and less affluent backgrounds also remains stubbornly unclosed, almost a decade on from it being made the government's \"number one priority\".",
      "The IFS argument is that continuing to plough money into school staffing against a backdrop of falling school rolls isn't the most cost-effective way to improve things.",
      "Pupil numbers are projected to fall by 90,000 by 2040. If teacher numbers hold steady at 2023 levels, then the pupil-teacher ratio will fall closer to 12 - the lowest ever.",
      "But IFS research economist Darcey Snape says smaller class sizes \"only tend to have modest effects on pupil attainment\".",
      "Her analysis suggests that letting teacher numbers fall could free up funds - up to \u00a3500m per year by 2040 - either for other areas of schooling, or indeed for other badly-stretched budgets such as social care.",
      "Ms Snape accepts there would inevitably be \"practical difficulties\", like amalgamating classes and schools as rolls fall - but says local councils are arguably best placed to make these decisions, \"rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach across Scotland\".",
      "The latter point is already the subject of some dispute between schools and councils.",
      "Ultimately councils are the employers, and control the overall numbers - the government can only enforce its policy by holding carrots and sticks over them.",
      "Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth has clashed with council leaders by threatening to withdraw funding which was offered on the basis of keeping numbers at 2023 levels.",
      "A deal has just been struck with Glasgow City Council, which was planning on cutting 450 posts over a three-year period - which in turn had led to strike threats from unions.",
      "Groups representing teachers are predictably negative about the IFS's report, calling it a \"false economy\" and a \"race to the bottom\".",
      "The EIS and NASUWT say things aren't as straightforward in schools as the report might make out.",
      "Both make the point that the number of pupils with additional support needs has risen to record levels. They need more support, not less, and cutting teacher numbers would \"further entrench existing inequalities\" in their prospects.",
      "They also point to the fact teachers already have \"excessive workloads and working hours\", and face issues with anti-social behaviour and even violence in classrooms.",
      "It is absolutely fair to argue that long-term planning needs to be done, to take account of shifting demographics.",
      "The ever-increasing strain on care services provides a prime example of why we need to be ready for the ways in which society will change.",
      "Perhaps we do need to have a grown-up debate about the best and most cost-effective way to improve outcomes in schools.",
      "But when the headline is getting rid of teachers, it's always going to be difficult to sell the idea to politicians who face an election in just over a year.",
      "The Scottish government has already flatly rejected the idea, saying teachers play a central role in driving improvements in schools.",
      "And as noted above, opposition parties are chiefly interested in holding ministers to account on their promised increases. Nobody is going to put cutting teacher numbers on a leaflet.",
      "And it's particularly tough to get MSPs to stick their necks out when we're talking about something which will be an issue in 2040, which feels pretty distant.",
      "But a year is famously a long time in politics, and 15 of them is an eternity. Look back 15 years and Gordon Brown was prime minister and the SNP were being propped up by the Conservatives at Holyrood.",
      "If one thing is guaranteed, it's change; it's incredibly unlikely that we will reach 2040 with the current policy structure intact.",
      "Unless something also shifts in terms of Scotland's birth rate and the pace of demographic change, decisions are going to be needed sooner or later."

      "For Cardiff University final-year languages student Darcie James, 23, the headlines hit close to home after her university last month announced plans to cut 400 jobs and close some courses.",
      "Her faculty, which she says \"feels like a little family\", is now at risk of closure. Nursing and music courses are also under threat.",
      "The University and College Union (UCU) branch says it will have a no-confidence vote in the leadership team at the university over the plans.",
      "Branch president Joey Whitfield, senior lecturer in Hispanic studies, says there is \"a lot of anger and uncertainty\", and that some students have reported staff crying to them during lectures.",
      "The university's vice-chancellor, Prof Wendy Larner, says the university's final plans \"will be shaped by our community\" in a 90-day consultation.",
      "\"The scale of the challenge will remain, but the way that we address it will certainly be refined and developed over the next 90 days,\" she says.",
      "Student Darcie says she was \"really shocked\" by the announcements, and that, as someone who has lived with anxiety, her course - in particular her year abroad in France and Spain - has \"made her as a person\".",
      "She says it is \"so important others have that available too\".",
      "'It feels like you're running into a wall'",
      "In January, the University of Kent said more jobs would be cut in a bid to save nearly \u00a320m.",
      "Last February, the university announced proposals to cut 58 jobs and \"phase out\" six subjects - art history, anthropology, health and social care, music and audio technology, journalism, and philosophy and religious studies - in response to its \"financial challenges\".",
      "Third-year journalism student Brendan Papp, 21, is being \"taught out\" - meaning students currently on the cancelled course are seeing it through until completion.",
      "When he applied, he says the course ranked in the top five in the country. Now, he says, it's fallen to \"dead last\".",
      "An international student from Virginia in the US, Brendan came to the UK to chase his dream of becoming a sports reporter. Now, he's keen to complete his course so he can move to Madrid to do sports management instead.",
      "He says the class lost \"two really good teachers because of the cuts\".",
      "Now he says \"it feels like you're running into a wall\" and, with engagement in the course dipping, he's struggling to see the results from his hard work.",
      "Brendan says the staff have been \"excellent\", though, trying to provide an experience that's \"as good as possible\".",
      "One staff member from a different department, who asked not to be named, says they believe the previous cuts have had a knock-on effect on student recruitment, leading to further cost-saving measures and damaging staff morale.",
      "A university spokesperson says that sentiment is not reflected in its staff surveys.",
      "They say \"sector finances are under severe pressure and, like many other institutions, we have been making wide-ranging changes\" in order to \"reflect what students and government are looking for from universities\".",

      "Nathan Wyatt, 23, the student union's welfare officer and a former politics student, says he led the charge against previous cuts in 2023.",
      "He says there is a feeling of \"fatigue\" about facing more cuts.",
      "\"The consensus on campus is that people are feeling drained, and they don't have the energy to go out and say 'no cuts' as loudly as they did before.\"",
      "Nadine Zubair, a digital humanities manager and co-chair of the university's UCU branch, says students and staff are affected by the cuts \"in every aspect of their experience here: their morale, their workloads - everything is taking a hit\".",
      "\"We are a world-leading sector, but the world is watching us crumble under our own managerial panic or desperation.\"",
      "A university spokesperson says UEA is still committed to \"high-quality student education and experience, and we will work hard to limit any impact on students\".",
      "They say \"compulsory redundancies will always be a last resort\".",
      "'It's making me reconsider a Masters'",
      "Durham University says it wants to save \u00a310m in staff costs by cutting about 200 professional services roles this year.",
      "Further savings could include cuts to academic staff next year, it says.",
      "Professional services staff support the running of the university, while academics are responsible for research and teaching.",
      "\"Strenuous efforts\" will be made to ensure these are voluntary redundancies, says Durham, adding that it \"remains a world-leading university\".",
      "Student Lily Gershon, 22, co-editor-in-chief of the student newspaper, says the cuts are making her reconsider whether she wants to go on to do a postgraduate course at Durham.",
      "She says the professional services staff who are facing cuts this year make up the \"backbone\" of the university.",
      "Lily, from Hong Kong, says her mum \"sacrifices\" to pay for her to go to university as she is not entitled to a student loan and lives on about \u00a350 per week.",
      "But she says being the cohort whose exams were cancelled due to Covid means \"we're quite a resilient bunch, so we know we can adapt\".",
      "Katie Muth, assistant professor in digital humanities and modern literature - and a member of Durham's UCU Committee - says colleagues are \"pretty worried across the board\" by the university's announcements.",
      "She says \"there's a lot of anxiety\" and colleagues are concerned about their workloads increasing as people leave.",
      "\"People are already working at or above capacity,\" she says.",
      "She believes \"band-aid\" solutions are not going to fix a higher education sector in need of systemic changes.",
      "A university spokesperson says all departments are being asked to find savings, and the university is engaging with staff \"in an open and transparent way\".",
      "They say any voluntary staff departure \"would be considered in relation to the likely workload impact and opportunities to reduce workload\".",
      "How did we get here?",
      "After the freeze on fees, universities say finances have been getting tighter for years.",
      "Then there was the shock of new visa restrictions on international postgraduates coming to the UK bringing their partners and children.",
      "International students pay higher fees, but the introduction of those restrictions in January 2024 has led to a drop of around 16% in applications.",
      "That, in turn, has led to more competition between universities to secure places for UK students.",
      "The body which regulates higher education in England, the Office for Students (OfS), has warned that without change on a scale not seen before, 72% of universities could slide into financial deficit - where a university spends more than it is bringing in - by 2026.",
      "\"We have called for universities and colleges to take bold, transformative steps to address the challenges, and we know that many are taking action already,\" an OfS spokesperson said.",
      "It is also nearly impossible to tell if a university will go bust.",
      "That is because universities borrow money from banks based on the value of the assets they own, like buildings and land. If they get into financial trouble, they will renegotiate the terms of their loan with the bank - and no bank wants to see a university which owes them money failing financially.",
      "The Department for Education says the government inherited a \"dire economic situation\" and has taken \"tough decisions to bolster universities' financial sustainability\".",
      "\"The Office for Students is rightly refocusing its efforts on monitoring financial sustainability, to help create a secure future for our world-leading sector,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "\"Whilst institutions are autonomous, we are committed to fixing the foundations of higher education to deliver change for students.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ticket sales for Beyonc\u00e9's highly-anticipated Cowboy Carter tour seem to have gone without a hitch, with many fans expressing surprise at how easy the process was.",
      "In contrast to the chaos surrounding Oasis and Taylor Swift's tours, online queues were kept to a minimum, and most people found the tickets they were looking for.",
      "\"I was in straight away, only 600 in front of me,\" wrote one fan on Reddit. \"I was able to find floor tickets for London even 30 min[utes] after general sale opened,\" added Shivam Arora on X. \"Not bad, to be honest.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's six UK dates at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London in June will be her first shows since 2023's record-breaking Renaissance Tour.",
      "Ticketmaster said prices ranged from \u00a371 to \u00a3950, but cheaper tickets were also available direct from the stadium's own website.",
      "The BBC was able to access Ticketmaster's page shortly after tickets went on sale at 12:00 GMT on Friday; and found tickets available in almost every section.",
      "The stadium map slowly greyed out as seats were snapped up - but prices remained static, suggesting that \"dynamic pricing\" was not in place.",
      "None of the dates were completely sold out at the time of writing, although in some cases only single seats remained.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's tour launched on a massive day for concertgoers - with tickets also becoming available for Ozzy Osbourne's final gig with Black Sabbath plus Kendrick Lamar & SZA, Patti Smith, Beck, Morrissey, Mumford & Sons, Razorlight and Smashing Pumpkins.",
      "One fan told the BBC they were willing to pay up to \u00a32,000 to attend Black Sabbath's charity concert in Birmingham, which will also feature performances from Metallica, Pantera, Anthrax, Gojira and members of Guns N' Roses.",
      "\"This really is Ozzy's final show with Sabbath,\" said Alex Woodford.",
      "\"I know it sounds crazy but I would be willing to pay silly money for it because it's going to be a once-in-a-lifetime show.\"",
      "British Beyonc\u00e9 fan Ben Archer, who has attended all of her concerts since 2014's Mrs Carter World Tour, was among those who secured tickets. \"She is the one artist I'm determined to see every time she tours,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Eleven years ago, he paid \u00a360 for a standing ticket. This year, he paid almost four times that.",
      "\"If tickets had always been this expensive I wouldn't have been able to see her as often as I have,\" he said.",
      "\"I wonder if the increase in price leads to only the diehard fans (myself included!) attending at the expense of 'recruiting' potentially new/casual fans who may be willing to take a punt if it was cheaper.\"",
      "Going to major gigs is an increasingly expensive pursuit.",
      "Before the pandemic, the cost of getting into a concert was increasing by 3% to 4% a year, according to Billboard Boxscore, which tracks ticket prices.",
      "That number more than doubled when touring resumed, with prices increasing by an average of 9.9% annually.",
      "The last time Beyonc\u00e9 played in London, the cheapest ticket cost \u00a356.25, while \u00a32,400 VIP packages bought you a seat on the stage itself. An average ticket cost \u00a3139, according to figures from Pollstar.",
      "For this summer's shows, Ticketmaster says \"tickets have been priced in advance for the tour, ranging from \u00a371.60 to \u00a3950 (including fees)\", but that doesn't include VIP packages.",
      "In this week's pre-sales, regular standing tickets were offered  at \u00a3224.85 - but standing places in small areas closest to the stage were \u00a3858.10.",
      "For some tours, including Beyonc\u00e9's last one, prices go up as they are adjusted, based on demand, due to Ticketmaster's \"dynamic pricing\" scheme.",
      "That means fans logging on to claim a seat often don\u2019t know what they\u2019ll be charged.",
      "Fans fight back",
      "One person trying to combat the uncertainty is Fredrica Fekkai, a Beyonc\u00e9 fan from Washington, DC, who has been crowd-sourcing data on prices for the star's new tour.",
      "She said some people who had accessed a fan pre-sale in the US had paid well over the odds - sometimes by hundreds of dollars - but most seats in the UK were within the advertised ranges.",
      "Fekkai decided to collate the data after buying her own tickets for the Cowboy Carter tour. In her city, the ticket seller didn't have to advertise the base price or mark-ups, and she found the process overwhelming.",
      "\"I was on the page for hours, wondering what was a good deal,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"I saw online [that] there was a lot of discussion on who was paying what, but of course, nothing was organised. I've worked in business consulting for years, so I'm used to finding the takeaways in messy information.\"",
      "After putting out a call on Reddit and TikTok, she received more than 1,000 responses from fans - and plotted the results on a graph to show the variance in price.",
      "She noticed that US fans who accessed a pre-sale through Beyonc\u00e9's \"Beyhive\" fan club often ended up paying more than those who went through pre-sales for sponsors like Mastercard and Verizon.",
      "\"The Beyhive sale had a lot of panic buying and/or increased dynamic prices from Ticketmaster/SeatGeek - I think both,\" she says.",
      "\"They see someone is willing to buy a $100 (\u00a380) ticket for $1,000 (\u00a3800), so they offer up that price again and again, and it gets snatched up,\" she theorises.",
      "Fekkai hopes fans will use her data to keep track of prices when the general sale begins, and avoid paying too much in the rush to secure tickets.",
      "But why are concerts suddenly so pricey?",
      "Ticketing expert Tim Chambers says the expense of touring has exploded over the past couple of years.",
      "As Beyonc\u00e9 sings on her latest album, it takes 16 Carriages to ferry her show around the world - and the cost of fuel, accommodation and work visas have all rocketed.",
      "The star also employed 304 people on her last tour, all of whom had to be paid a living wage, even on days she wasn't performing.",
      "But that's not all.",
      "\"There's also a certain amount of recuperation from the lost years of Covid,\" Chambers says.",
      "\"Artists were forced to take a couple of years out, because no-one could tour, but they still had living expenses and lifestyle expenses. So apart from the increase in costs, you're looking to capture what you can from the live experience.\"",

      "Ticketmaster UK boss tells MPs prices are very fair",

      "But most artists, he says, are \"lazy\".",
      "\"I mean this in the nicest way, but they want to do as little as possible and get as paid as much as possible.\"",
      "Increased costs are also exerting a downward pressure on the rest of the concert industry.",
      "\"Every time a major artist announces tickets at \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, the consumer doesn't necessarily have that additional amount in their wallet, so they look to cut back in where they can,\" says Chambers.",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.",
      "Cheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.",
      "Now, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.",
      "\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.",
      "\"That's what we want.\"",
      "Mr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.",

      "Why Hollywood's big boom has gone bust",
      "Productions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.",
      "The loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.",
      "Before the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.",
      "\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"",

      "Power lines, hikers, arson: What might have sparked LA's devastating fires?",
      "Mel Gibson, Jeff Bridges and other LA celebrities lose homes to wildfires",
      "'I have nothing to go back to' - LA fires heartbreak",
      "Hollywood's studios and streaming services have donated more than $70m (\u00a356m) to fire relief efforts and have turned the glitzy awards season parties and red carpets typical this time of year into major fundraisers.",
      "Many say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA.",
      "But studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.",
      "Studios are, however, very responsive to A-list actors.",

      "Nearly 20,000 people \u2013 including actors Keanu Reeves, Zooey Deschanel and Kevin Bacon \u2013 have signed a \"Stay in LA\" petition urging the state's leaders to temporarily remove caps on production tax incentives for LA County.",
      "It's part of a grassroots campaign started by director Sarah Adina Smith and other filmmakers who want California to use its emergency powers to boost tax incentives for the next three years to make filming in LA more affordable and help heal Los Angeles. They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.",
      "\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.",
      "Before the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.",
      "He says the incentives are good for the economy and that California's programme has generated more than $26bn in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.",
      "If passed, the subsidy would be the most generous offered by any US state except Georgia, which doesn't have a cap on the amount it gives to productions per year. Stay in LA wants the cap lifted now.",
      "President Donald Trump has also said he plans to make Hollywood great again with the help of actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, who have been tapped to be \"special ambassadors\" for \"troubled Hollywood\".",
      "It's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.",
      "On a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated. They marvelled that a cactus was regrowing next to where their SUV had melted.",
      "\"If only we'd had this rain in January,\" says Ms Elliott.",
      "Although he is critical that the tax breaks amount to \"corporate welfare\" for behemoth companies, Mr Worthington says they are a necessary evil if LA wants to compete - both Australia and the UK now have more lucrative tax breaks than California.",
      "Ms Smith, the co-founder of Stay in LA, likens the decline of Hollywood productions to the fall of Detroit, whose once formidable automotive industry collapsed, leaving much of the city desolate and impoverished.",
      "\"Once you ruin that infrastructure and that legacy, it's not so easy to build it back again,\" she says. \"If we let Hollywood die, it could be for good.\"",
      "Others think it's na\u00efve to think that any incentives will usher in a new Golden Age of Hollywood.",
      "Pointing out the melted remains of what used to be his piano and his drum set in the music studio of his incinerated Topanga Canyon home, composer Matthew Ferraro wipes away tears for what he and his wife have lost.",
      "His once spectacular hilltop home is now rubble and ash and Ferraro says he's still in shock, consumed with thoughts of where he will sleep on Tuesday, rather than his future in LA.",
      "\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.",
      "About a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.",
      "She laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.",
      "\"Whether they're performers or studio execs - people love this city,\" says Ms Morse, who now sleeps at friends' homes or in her car with her dog between comedy gigs or classes with her improv troupe, The Groundlings.",
      "Ms Morse wishes she'd taken more sentimental things when she evacuated with her dog, like a Toronto Blue Jays T-shirt which reminded her of her grandfather and her native Canada. But she's astonished that some of her notebooks and journals survived with some of her comedy writing intact.",
      "\"Where an entire stone table is, is in pieces, is like, absolutely decimated, melted,\" she said. \"But pieces of paper survived\u2026 It's truly unbelievable.\"",
      "Does she think it's fate? A sign that she is meant to make it in Hollywood?",
      "\"I'm choosing to believe that this is a sign,\" she says, adding that there will be \"beautiful, creative things to come out of this very, very crappy time.\""

    "summary": "Senior Netflix boss says it is a shame historic offensive tweets by film's star have distracted from it.",
    "story": [
      "A senior Netflix executive has said the discovery of historic offensive tweets by the star of Emilia P\u00e9rez \"really is a bummer\" for those connected to the film.",
      "Tweets posted by Oscar nominee Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, mostly between 2019 and 2024, have caused significant fallout and left the film's awards campaign in disarray.",
      "The Spanish actress has \"sincerely apologised to everyone who has been hurt\" and stepped back from the film's awards campaign.",
      "In a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"",
      "Speaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that.",
      "\"It really has kind of taken the conversation in a different way [from] this incredible movie that Jacques Audiard - who is an incredible director - has made.",
      "\"It really is a bummer for a lot of the people, like [co-stars] Zoe [Salda\u00f1a] and Selena [Gomez]. And in our awards team did an incredible campaign for that movie.\"",
      "The original tweets saw Gasc\u00f3n make comments about Islam, George Floyd, and the high level of diversity at the Oscars.",
      "After they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context.",
      "Asked if Netflix would change its social media vetting process for actors on its projects in the future, Bajaria replied: \"It's not really common practice for people to vet social tweets that way.",
      "\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"",
      "She highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence?",
      "\"It raises a lot of questions about what that should look like.\"",
      "Bajaria added that, despite the tweets, Netflix did not regret its decision to pick up the film.",
      "\"If you ask me today, everything I know, we would still buy the movie today,\" she said. \"That movie is incredible and it's creative and it's bold - that's what you want, and it resonated with a lot of people this year.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n pulled out of appearing at several awards season events after the tweets came to light, and is not scheduled to appear at the Baftas on Sunday. It is not yet clear whether she will still attend the Oscars on 2 March.",
      "In an Instagram post last week, the best actress nominee said she wanted to step back and \"let the work talk for itself\".",
      "She added she hoped her silence would \"allow the film to be appreciated for what it is, a beautiful ode to love and difference\".",
      "Her statement followed an interview the film's director Jacques Audiard gave to Deadline, in which he condemned Gasc\u00f3n's tweets and said he was no longer in contact with her.",
      "Netflix had not publicly commented before Bajaria's interview, but the streamer had altered the film's awards campaign following the controversy.",
      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Later, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "After his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"",
      "She also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 01:36:34 GMT",
    "summary": "Jurors had been questioned about whether Rihanna's connection to the case could sway the verdict",
    "story": [
      "Rapper A$AP Rocky's assault trial is in full swing as his attorneys this week are mounting their defence against the charges that could derail his career.",
      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna has sat out of view of cameras in the courtroom.",
      "A$AP Rocky's trial begins with prosecutors showing video of shooting",

    "title": "Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl show was one big tease",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 04:41:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The star hinted that he might not play his smash hit Not Like Us, but gave viewers plenty to absorb.",
    "story": [
      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",
      "\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"",
      "It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience.",
      "\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.",
      "\u201cThe revolution about to be televised,\u201d he intoned at the top of his set.",
      "\u201cThe picked the right time but the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.",
      "Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.",
      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",
      "Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake.",
      "On-stage protest",
      "Nonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.",
      "The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.",
      "The NFL later said in a statement that the protester was part of the 400-member cast who took part in the show.",

      "The pair duetted on a remix of her single Bad Blood in 2015 - and fans hoped they might perform it live for the first time at the Super Bowl.",
      "In the end, Swift opted just to watch the show, along with other celebrity attendees including Paul McCartney, Stormzy, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, Ice Spice, Doechii, Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper and Winnie Harlow.",
      "Maybe it was for the best: Some reports suggested that Swift had been booed at the stadium, where almost 80% of fans supported the Philadelphia Eagles, rather than her boyfriend Travis Kelce's team.",
      "Lady Gaga's surprise performance",
      "Before kick-off, Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance on Bourbon Street, in the middle of New Orleans' historic French Quarter.",
      "The star, who played her own Super Bowl half-time show in 2017, played a touching rendition of her song Hold My Hand, honouring the victims of the New Year's Day terror attack that claimed the lives of 14 people in the city.",
      "Gaga was surrounded by first responders as she played a black baby grand piano in the middle of the road.",
      "\"Here on Bourbon Street, always the heart and soul of New Orleans, this year began with a terror attack that tried to shatter its spirit,\" said former American footballer Michael Strahan during the pre-filmed segment.",
      "\"But the resilience of New Orleans is matched by the resolve of our country.\"",
      "Musical performances before the game also included R&B artist Ledisi, who performed Lift Every Voice and Sing, often referred to as the Black National anthem, joined by 125 youth choir members.",
      "Musician Troy Andrews, popularly known as Trombone Shorty, and Christian singer-songwriter Lauren Daigle played America the Beautiful - giving the track a feel-good New Orleans vibe.",
      "And just before the game began, New Orleans native Jon Batiste sang the American National Anthem, adding a few jazz flourishes from his multi-coloured grand piano."

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 22:14:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The first K-pop boy band with North Korean members aims to debut in the US later this year.",
    "story": [
      "Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia.",
      "Besides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice.",
      "This was just \"part of everyday life\" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams.",
      "But dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band.",
      "1Verse (pronounced \"universe\") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.",
      "From scraps to rap",
      "Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four.",
      "Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.",
      "Hyuk says his family was \"not extremely poor\" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.",
      "Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea.",
      "It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk.",
      "Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea\u2019s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.",
      "Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says.",
      "He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t openly share what I\u2019d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.\u201d",
      "At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn\u2019t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap.",
      "Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as \u201cthe loneliest of the loners\u201d - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project.",
      "Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself.",
      "But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle.",
      "\"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,\" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South.",
      "But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was \"investing way too much time and money\" for it to be anything but genuine.",
      "'I thought North Koreans might be scary'",
      "Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.",
      "Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.",
      "Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.",
      "Both boys were described by Ms Cho as \"blank canvases\", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.",
      "Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.",
      "\u201cThey had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,\" she said.",
      "But their ability to \u201cendure physical challenges\u201d astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were \u201coverdoing it\u201d.",
      "Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,\u201d says Ms Cho. \u201cAt first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, \u2018Because you said so last time'.\u201d",
      "But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says.",
      "\"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,\" says Ms Cho chuckling.",
      "But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates?",
      "\u201cI was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,\u201d says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.",
      "Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.",
      "\"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]\", he said. \"I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective.\"",
      "Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group.",
      "They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans.",
      "Playing one day - in North Korea?",
      "Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.",
      "So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs.",
      "With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.",
      "To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as \u201cthe upper side\u201d in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.",
      "A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.",
      "One academic says it would cause a \"stir\" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit.",
      "\"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,\" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.",
      "But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success.",
      "\u201cMany defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,\" said Hyuk.",
      "\u201cSo if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That\u2019s why I am trying my hardest.\u201d"

    "summary": "Conclave stars Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, and is leading the nominations in the BAFTAs on Sunday.",
    "story": [
      "As a young boy, film editor Nick Emerson's fascination with 1970s American political thrillers, and watching the unfolding peace talks in Northern Ireland, set him on a path that would lead to him working on one of the most acclaimed films of last year.",
      "Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, is leading this year's Bafta nominations, receiving nods in 12 categories, including Best Editing.",
      "The film is also thought to be a strong contender for the best picture award at next month's Oscars, and several of its stars, and Emerson, could also be in contention for individual prizes.",
      "Growing up in Lisburn, County Antrim, Emerson told BBC News NI that the talks which brought about the Good Friday Agreement gave him an appetite for this depiction of the election of a new pope, and the skills to put it together.",
      "\"Working in the BBC newsroom at the start of my career was a really exciting place to be,\" he said.",
      "\"There were a lot of peace talks and a lot of news.\"",
      "He describes Conclave - which follows a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals as they select the new Pope - in similar terms.",
      "\"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on... people with competing interests and competing ideologies.\"",
      "Emerson moved through the media industry, inspired by his experience in the BBC Newsroom in Belfast.",
      "\"I found myself doing factual TV and now feature films. Its the process, that's the joy of it for me.\"",
      "Conclave opens with the death of the Pope, prompting cardinals to gather in Rome to select a new head of the Catholic Church.",
      "But it comes with all the skullduggery, wheeling and dealing, and conspiracy one would expect, as the frontrunners try to improve their chances of becoming the Vicar of Christ.",
      "Emerson was in his editing suite working on upcoming projects when the Bafta nominations were announced.",
      "\"We watched the live stream. And we were just jumping up and down, screaming,\" he said.",
      "The film is an adaptation of the Robert Harris novel, published in 2016, in which faith and ambition collide in the heart of the Vatican.",
      "It's not the first time a papal conclave has been depicted on screen, and though the real world process is shrouded in mystery, there has been a number of notable attempts to dramatise what goes on.",
      "'Crisis of faith'",
      "Emerson told BBC News that he and Edward Berger - the acclaimed German-Austrian film-maker whose 2022 adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front was nominated for nine Academy Awards - aspired to make something that would replicate the 70s thrillers they grew up on.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 15:53:14 GMT",
    "summary": "After Lamar's show, a reminder of where we are now in the big rap feud, and exactly how we got here.",
    "story": [
      "Kendrick Lamar's show-stopping performance at Super Bowl on Sunday was, for many, a victory lap following his knock-out blow in a long-running beef with fellow rapper Drake.",
      "The Compton star's entire half-time set seemed to swiftly build to a performance of Not Like Us, his Grammy-winning takedown of Drake which was one of last year's biggest hits... but is also now the subject of a potential libel case brought by the Canadian.",
      "Drake was performing in Australia on Sunday, dishing out cash to several of his fans at a Melbourne show, before the whole world tuned in to watch his rival.",
      "The origins of the argument go back more than decade. But here's a quick reminder of where we are now and how we got here over a heated 12 months:",
      "'The big three'",
      "In March last year, producer and former Drake collaborator Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You.",
      "Hidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive.",
      "In it, Lamar took aim at rapper J Cole's previous claim - that himself, Kendrick and Drake were \"the big three\" - proclaiming: \"[forget] the big three - it's just big me\".",
      "After years of tension, the fuse had been lit.",
      "Three become two",
      "Soon after, Drake appeared to address Kendrick's verse at a concert in Florida.",
      "He told the crowd: \"I know that no matter what, it's not a [person] on this earth that could ever [expletive] with me in my life!\"",
      "Two weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, on a track called 7 Minute Drill, but he soon realised it had been a huge \"mis-step\".",
      "Speaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song, praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness.",
      "Boiling point",
      "Drake then released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists.",
      "\"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" he cajoled.",
      "He also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him.",
      "More rappers, including Kanye West and Rick Ross got drawn into the feud. But Drake's attention was solely focused on Lamar.",
      "The Toronto star goaded his US adversary by dropping yet another diss track called Taylor Made Freestyle, which suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department.",
      "What's more he used artificial intelligence to deliver the insults in the voices of Lamar's heroes, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg.",
      "Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl show was one big tease",
      "Taylor Swift, Lionel Messi, Jay-Z and Trump among big names at Super Bowl",
      "Eagles demolish Chiefs to deny them Super Bowl three-peat",
      "Kendrick comes out fighting",
      "Lamar finally responded with a full-blown, six-minute riposte on record.",
      "Titled Euphoria (a reference to the HBO show where Drake serves as an executive producer), it saw him brand Drake as \"predictable\", a \"master manipulator\" and a \"habitual liar\",  while calling his sparring partner's parenting skills into question.",
      "\"Let me say I'm the biggest hater,\" he rapped. \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"",
      "Less than 72 hours later, he followed up with a second song called 6:16 in LA.",
      "In it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information.",
      "\"You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"",
      "Families embroiled",
      "In May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights.",
      "On the track, he speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation).",
      "Within 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: \"You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name\".",
      "Each verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members, listing the rapper's supposed failures.",
      "Among the claims, he said Drake had secretly fathered second child, and was addicted to gambling, sex and drugs.",
      "Drake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his \"hidden daughter\" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a \"shambles\".",
      "But the Californian wasn't finished and he dropped a fourth diss track, Not Like Us, in which he accused Drake of having relationships with underage women.",
      "\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,\" he rapped.",
      "Drake hit back a day later, angrily denying the accusations and daring Lamar to reveal proof.",
      "\"Drake is not a name that you gonn' see on no sex offender list, easy does it / You mentioning A minor \u2026 B sharp and tell the fans: Who was it?\"",
      "Club hit",
      "Lamar's pop-orientated Not Like Us became a big summer club hit - picking up 21 million streams in its first three days of release.",
      "It went on to earn one billion streams on Spotify and later five Grammy Awards, at last month's ceremony, including song of the year.",
      "Things took a darker turn, when a security guard outside Drake's house was shot although there is no proof it was connected to the rappers' feud. However, the vandalism of Drake's OVO shop in London apparently was.",
      "At one star-studded gig in Los Angeles in June, which was intended as a show of unity for the West Coast rap fraternity, Lamar played his biggest diss track five times.",
      "Drake sues record label",
      "Fast forward to January this year, and Drake decided to sue the Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of Not Like Us.",
      "In papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".",
      "In response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade said his claims were not only untrue but \"illogical\".",
      "It also accused the star of trying to \"silence\" Lamar, who shares the same label, by taking their rap battle to the courts.",
      "\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists,\" the label said.",
      "\"He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music.\"",
      "Super Bowl show",
      "Which brings us to the Super Bowl. A couple of minutes into his half-time show, Lamar said: \"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue.\"",
      "In the build-up to the big event, there had been questions over whether he would, or even could play it, legally-speaking.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric. But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game, as well as the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Taylor Swift, Sir Paul McCartney and Stormzy who were inside the stadium.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who reportedly once dated Drake and whose name seemingly appears in the lyrics of the song in question.",
      "Williams, a Compton kid like Kendrick, performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as the headliner prowled the stage.",
      "In a review of the gig, the Guardian said the Pulitzer prize-winning rapper \"delivered the final blow to his diss track nemesis\".",
      "While over in the US, Variety noted how Lamar had quite literally declared \"game over\" in the battle.",
      "On Monday, Lamar announced a joint UK and Europe stadium tour with SZA, who joined him on-stage on Sunday night, which will take in Glasgow, Birmingham, London and Cardiff from July this year. Drake does not currently have any UK tour dates scheduled for 2025."

      "Cowboy Carter is, obviously, the name of Beyonc\u00e9's latest album.",
      "But \"Chitlin' Circuit\" might raise some questions in your mind.",
      "What's the Chitlin' Circuit?",
      "From the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.",
      "It meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces.",
      "During this era, black musicians and performers created their own network of live performance venues across the United States.",
      "Known as the Chitlin' Circuit, it took its name from \"Chitterling\" - a dish made with pig's intestines popular in the south, where Jim Crow laws were most prevalent.",
      "Venues were considered safe and acceptable spaces for black musicians, comedians and audiences and gave many pioneering performers a platform to hone their craft.",
      "Almost every notable black musician of the time graced the circuit at some point, including stars such as Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Jimi Hendrix and James Brown.",
      "The circuit was \"tremendously important to the development of black music\", says Mia Bay, Professor of American History at Cambridge University.",
      "\"The black stars of the day would travel the circuit,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat.",
      "\"It was very important to sustaining the careers of many important black performers - it allowed them to make a living in music.",
      "\"They were on the road all the time.\"",
      "Prof Bay says the presence of the circuit was also \"very helpful to black communities\".",
      "Performers were drawn to \"black vacation spots\" and the theatres at those locations, Prof Bay says.",
      "\"This would in turn help the careers of these entertainers,\" she says.",
      "\"It was one of the more successful segregation-era businesses.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 has often paid tribute to black performers, and Prof Bay feels the singer's Texas roots may have played a role in that.",
      "\"[It] was very much a segregated state, so this would be something that would be a very direct reference in terms of where she grew up and how she thinks about American history.",
      "\"I also think she, in some ways, has a nostalgic reference, because it was such a communal circuit with a lot of performers,\" she says.",
      "The star's latest tour stops off at notable Chitlin' Circuit cities such as Houston and Chicago.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 fan and music history content creator Nat Brown feels that's not a coincidence.",
      "Unlike Renaissance, this tour is smaller with only eight cities being played in total globally, with six of those in the US.",
      "\"It's a very small tour,\" says Nat.",
      "\"Just like it historically was with the Chitlin' Circuit, where you only went to seven to 10 places.",
      "\"And if people were able to see you - great. But most often, people missed out because you blazed through town and went to the next spot.\"",

      "It's a dilemma for the medical staff, with 15-30% of patients at the Royal Free medically fit to be discharged but unable to go home, for a myriad of reasons.",
      "The hospital has its own discharge team - whose job it is to safely get patients out of the door, to free up beds for new admissions. Just under 14,000 people who are medically fit are still in English hospitals and can't go home, through no fault of their own.",
      "At the Royal Free London Trust, there are 275 people occupying beds who don't need to, at three major sites. That makes up nearly 20% of all the beds the trust has.",

The doctors and nurses on duty, professional as ever, head straight for her bed, at least six or seven people. They need to get her to the resuscitation area fast, to save her life. But they can barely make their way out of the ward, because of all the patients in the corridor.",

Despite the self-harm and his mental state, the ambulance staff tell the on-duty nurse that the outside mental health assessment service CASS, had refused to intervene, saying the patient wasn't in crisis.",

    "title": "How much is the NHS going to cost us?",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:38:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Spending on the NHS has been going up for decades and is set to rise further. BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The amount of money the UK spends on health, predominantly on the NHS, has been rising for decades.",
      "And as the UK population ages and people demand access to new medicines and treatments, there is every likelihood that the national bill will continue to grow.",
      "So how much could the NHS ultimately end up costing the nation? And is it possible to get better value for the money we collectively spend?",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
      "How much do we spend on health?",
      "Shortly after the NHS was founded, in 1949-50, total UK health spending was around \u00a317bn in today's money.",
      "By 2023\u201324 it had grown to \u00a3226bn.",
      "Health spending per person in 2022-23 was around \u00a33,300 in England and Scotland, \u00a33,600 in Wales and \u00a33,500 in Northern Ireland.",
      "In the Autumn Budget last year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an additional \u00a326bn a year for the English health budget by 2025-26, which will automatically increase the resources available to the devolved nations.",
      "As a share of the overall economy - or GDP - spending on health has massively increased over the past 70 years.",
      "In 1949-50, health spending was only 3.6% of GDP. In 2023-24, it had more than doubled to 8.1% of GDP, after peaking at more than 10% in the Covid pandemic.",
      "Health spending jumped in the pandemic due to the costs of vaccinations and the \"test and trace\" programme.",
      "Around 80% of total health spending is funded by the government in the UK, mainly going to the NHS. The other 20% comes through private insurance schemes or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "That means health spending as a share of total government spending has also considerably increased.",
      "In the middle of the 1950s, health accounted for around \u00a31 in every \u00a38 the government spent.",
      "Today it's roughly \u00a31 in every \u00a33.",
      "How does that compare to other countries?",
      "Despite that surge in health spending in recent decades, the UK is by no means an outlier among rich countries.",
      "In 2022, using comparable data on public health spending, the UK was spending around 9.3% of GDP.",
      "That was higher than Canada (7.9%) and Italy (6.8%) as well as the EU average, but less than Germany (10.9%) and France (10.2%).",
      "The US was the real outlier, spending 14.1% of GDP on health, largely because America has a private insurance system with few of the cost controls of other nations.",
      "And those countries have, like the UK, seen health spending rise considerably in recent decades, driven up by growing demand for new medical treatments and ageing populations.",
      "What's going to happen to NHS spending in future?",
      "Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster, said there was every likelihood there would be continued upward pressure on UK public health spending, citing those same factors: an ageing population and more demand for new medicines and treatments.",
      "It also cites rising ill health among the population as one of the contributors to rising spending, albeit not the dominant one.",
      "The amount of health spending on an individual rises dramatically as they grow older. Average annual spending per person on those aged 45 is around \u00a32,000. For those aged 85 it is \u00a313,000 a year.",
      "The OBR projects that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over will rise from around one in five today to one in four by 2070.",
      "As people's incomes grow, research suggests they are typically willing to spend more of those incomes on healthcare, which in the UK is done mainly through the taxpayer-funded NHS.",
      "In its central forecast, the OBR projected UK public healthcare spending will rise by around 3% every year, after adjusting for inflation. This would be broadly in line with average growth over recent decades, although the rate has fluctuated under different governments.",
      "The OBR estimates this trend would add up to roughly an extra 1% of GDP going on public health spending every decade going forward.",
      "That would take public health spending from around 8% of GDP in 2024-25, up to 14.5% of GDP by 2073-74, equivalent to around \u00a3180bn in today's money.",
      "However, this would also depend on the long term growth rate of the economy. The OBR assumes public health spending will grow roughly twice as fast as the overall economy.",
      "If that path of spending transpired, it would also likely mean health spending accounting for an even larger share of total government public service spending.",
      "How do we get better value for money from health spending?",
      "Many politicians argue it's important for the NHS to deliver higher levels of productivity, in other words, to spend money more efficiently in order to keep the national bill under control.",
      "Productivity growth in the NHS has long lagged behind productivity growth in the rest of the UK economy.",
      "Last year, the OBR looked at what would happen if NHS productivity grew faster than currently expected in the coming decades.",
      "This, the OBR said, could curb the overall rise in public health spending. It might rise only to 11% of GDP by 2074, rather than to 14.5%.",
      "The recent indications of productivity growth in the NHS, however, are unclear.",
      "The latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics are that in the second half of 2024 NHS measured \"inputs\" - mainly in the form of more doctors and nurses hired - were 32% higher than they were before the pandemic in 2019.",
      "But measured \"outputs\" - things like operations completed and patients discharged - were only up by 7%.",
      "This meant that UK public sector health productivity was still around 19% lower than it was five years previously - and showing no signs of sustained growth.",
      "However, measuring productivity in the public services is far from simple and the ONS has stressed that these statistics are still only \"in development\".",
      "Other estimates from NHS England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - the independent economic research institute - point to an improvement in productivity in hospitals in England more recently, suggesting a corner might have been turned in the delivery of health services after the shock of the pandemic.",
      "But regardless of the statistical discrepancy, most experts agree that improving productivity in the health sector in the medium and long term is an important objective. And the extent to which it is delivered will play a key part in determining how much the NHS ends up costing the nation in the coming years.",

      "Although exceedingly rare, a poorly positioned cup inside the vaginal passage can press on other nearby structures, such as ureters - tubes carrying urine to the bladder, according to Danish doctors quoted in the British Medical Journal.",
      "Selecting the appropriate size cup is important, as well as inserting it properly, doctors have stressed.",
      "The patient made a complete recovery, but doctors have warned: \"Correct positioning, along with choosing the correct cup shape and size, is important to prevent negative effects on the upper urinary tract.",
      "\"Menstrual cups can be bought and used without clinical advice from a health professional, which emphasises the importance of detailed and clear patient information material.\"",
      "How to use a menstrual cup",
      "Reusable and sustainable, menstrual cups are an alternative to sanitary pads and tampons.",
      "They are made from soft, flexible silicone or rubber and, once correctly in place, can hold 20 to 30ml - around two tablespoons - of blood.",
      "They can be removed, emptied, washed and reinserted every four to eight hours, depending on flow.",

      "Menstrual cups can be tricky for first-time users though, particularly when it comes to removal.",
      "A recent survey of 530 young people reported many found it difficult to remove the menstrual cup on their first attempt, with some saying they had to ask for help.",
      "Once inserted into the vagina, menstrual cups create a suction seal to stop any seepage of blood.",
      "When removing, users are warned not to simply pull on the stem. Instead, squeeze the bottom of the cup to break the seal and wiggle it off, says physiotherapist Dr Kate Lough, an expert in pelvic health.",
      "She says it may take women a few menstrual cycles to become accustomed to using one, and stresses wearing a cup should not hurt.",
      "She told BBC News: \"Generally, they are a very safe product.",
      "\"When it's in correctly, you shouldn't feel it.\"",
      "Menstrual cups vary in shape, size and firmness, so Dr Lough advises shopping around to find one that matches your requirements.",

      "A brightly coloured chalk sign informs me that the water temperature today is a chilly 3.9C, as one of the regulars tells me this is not cold water swimming, it's \"ice\" water swimming.",
      "How did I end up here?",
      "Well, I've become enthralled by the idea of enhancing or boosting the immune system. My body has been the living embodiment of the \"quademic\" that the NHS spent all winter warning us about. It's been a relentless stream of colds and coughs and one explosive tummy.",
      "Our immune systems already do a fantastic job fighting viruses and other nasties. If I collected all the air I breathed out over the course of a minute it would contain 100 to 10,000 bacteria, 25,000 viruses and a single fungus, according to Prof John Tregoning, immunologist at Imperial College London.",
      "\"You're breathing these things in all the time; there's just a swirling mass of pathogens [organisms that cause disease] in the air,\" he says.",
      "But there's plenty of foods, supplements and activities that are touted for their \"immune-boosting\" properties. Can we dial up our protection?",

      "But studies have shown the adrenaline hit of the cold water does flood the blood stream with infection-fighting cells.",
      "White blood cells \u2013 which could produce antibodies or attack infected tissue \u2013 move out of their normal homes and head out on patrol thinking there could be an infection. So does this mean I'm more protected?",
      "\"Within a few hours that all goes back to normal,\" says Prof Eleanor Riley, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh.",
      "\"There is no evidence that people who go cold water swimming have fewer colds or fewer infections.\"",
      "Cold water dips and swims: the benefits and risks",
      "Listen: Can you really boost your immune system?",
      "Regular exercise may give you a younger immune system",
      "There might not be the evidence for cold water, but regular exercise may well do the trick.",
      "On average adults get two to three colds per year and children between five and eight, says Dr Margaret McCartney, a GP and expert in evidence-based medicine, at the University of St Andrews.",
      "\"[But] people who do moderate amounts of exercise tend to report fewer viral infections,\" she says.",
      "There is a lack of conclusive clinical trials, but the data we have is \"all pointing in the direction of it being good for you\u2026 but not a miracle cure,\" according to Dr McCartney.",
      "Laboratory studies have suggested regular exercise may slow the ageing of the immune system. Your body's defences are in decline from our 20s onwards, but research on 80-year-old cyclists suggested they had the immune systems of people decades younger.",
      "\"I know the trials have not really been done in high enough quality, but I'm going to be doing a lot of cycling,\" she says.",
      "What about vitamins?",
      "The first thing that springs to my mind is vitamin C \u2013 either by devouring a mountain of oranges or in pill form.",
      "\"It's a no from me,\" says Dr McCartney. Being deficient may impair the immune system, but for the vast majority there is little to be gained from having extra. The same goes for multivitamins, which says Dr McCartney just make \"expensive urine\".",
      "However, the evidence around vitamin D is hotly debated rather than being a firm no. Vitamin D levels dip in winter as it is made when our skin is exposed to sunlight.",
      "\"I think the evidence is pointing towards possible benefits for people who've got respiratory disease and who are very low in vitamin D,\" says Dr McCartney, but there is \"insufficient\" evidence that it would help everyone.",
      "And while you're thinking what you might put in the shopping trolley, the jury is still out on whether prebiotics and probiotics that change the good bacteria in your gut also benefit immunity.",
      "\"I do believe that is a really important area of study, but we are lacking the real world data that would enable you to recommend this,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "She also says echinacea, turmeric and ginger shots are not going to give you an immune boost.",
      "Keep an eye on the clock?",
      "Your immune system's abilities are not fixed throughout the day.",
      "\"Our immune system is most effective in the early morning at around the time we wake up, continues to be highly effective through the early part of the day and then later on in the day it starts to wind down,\" says Prof Riley.",
      "This is why your cold often feels worse in the morning as your symptoms are the result of an immune system firing on all cylinders.",
      "The decline kicks in \"about four or five o'clock in the afternoon\", so you might have better protection if you are vaccinated, or exposed to someone coughing, in the morning.",
      "As the immune system does have this 24-hour cycle, then having  \"a regular daily rhythm\" rather than a mix of late nights and long lie-ins at the weekend \"may well help boost your immune system\", says Prof Riley.",
      "Stop damaging your immune defences!",
      "While we are thinking of boosting our immune system we should also remember there are things that actually increase our vulnerability to infection.",
      "One of the big ones is smoking because it directly damages the lungs so they are a less effective barrier to viruses.",
      "\"If you imagine the lungs like a sieve, smoking will break holes in the sieve, so more can get through,\" says Prof Tregoning.",
      "It also dials up inflammation throughout the body. Inflammation is like a thermostat for the immune system and is a normal part of how the body reacts to an infection.",
      "But \"uncontrolled inflammation is bad for you\" as it disrupts the immune system \"so you may respond less well\".",
      "Obesity is another factor that can increase susceptibility to infections as well as the severity by ramping up inflammation in the body.",
      "\"Both of those things can be difficult for people to stop or to reverse, but they are probably the most modifiable ones,\" says Dr McCartney.",
      "Destress if you can",
      "Being constantly stressed raises levels of the hormone cortisol in the body.",
      "Yet, cortisol dampens the immune system which may leave you more prone to infection.",
      "Prof Tregoning says this may be the explanation for why being in nature, going for a walk, spending time with friends \u2013 even cold water swimming \u2013 may have some beneficial effect.",
      "\"You're less stressed, less cortisol, so therefore your immune system is more fit for the role it is trying to do,\" he says.",

      "If you are already doing all the usual things to look after your health \u2013 not smoking, eating healthily, exercising regularly \u2013 then your immune system is already in the \"best possible condition\" to respond to an infection, says Prof Riley.",

      "Last year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.",
      "Reeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.",
      "She stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.",
      "The chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.",
      "In fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".",
      "The bank was undergoing restructuring at the time of Reeves's departure and a spokesman for the chancellor said she had taken voluntary redundancy.",
      "A compromise agreement, now known as a settlement agreement, is a legal document between an employer and employee which HBOS used when senior managers were made redundant.",
      "Reeves was allowed to continue using a company car for six months, according to her spokesman.",
      "She then spent a year campaigning ahead of the May 2010 general election without seeking further employment.",
      "The MP for Leeds West and Pudsey has previously faced accusations that she has embellished her online CV.",
      "Her LinkedIn profile was changed last year to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",
      "It had previously claimed she worked as an economist at the bank but she instead held a management role in the bank's Customer Relations department, which dealt with complaints.",
      "In November, several MPs raised the row in the House of Commons while putting questions to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.",
      "The prime minister's spokeswoman also faced questions at that time, with journalists asking if Sir Keir expected members of his Cabinet to tell the truth on their CV.",
      "The spokeswoman said the row related to \"the chancellor's time before she was the chancellor\".",
      "\"The prime minister is very clear that what is most important is having a chancellor who is able to balance the books and who is able to be straight with the public and restore the public finances,\" she added.",

    "title": "The Chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "BBC News has learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Rachel Reeves, and two other senior managers, when she worked at HBOS.",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Reeves has had a difficult start to her ministerial career.",
      "As well as Labour's new chancellor taking on the challenges of the UK economy, she has faced tricky questions about her past.",
      "They began with scrutiny of her online CV late last year.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed to have worked as an economist at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) immediately before becoming an MP.",
      "One of those who challenged it was a retired former colleague, Kev Gillett.",
      "In a public post on LinkedIn, which he asked followers to share, he wrote: \"Back in 2009 Rt Hon Rachel Reeves worked 3 levels below me. Just facts. She was a Complaints Support Manager at LBG/HBOS. Not an Economist. #factcheck.\"",
      "In fact it emerged that she had worked in a managerial role within the bank's complaint handling department and her LinkedIn profile was updated to remove the claim.",
      "Rachel Reeves's online CV exaggerated how long she spent working at the Bank of England",
      "Gillett also made another claim about Reeves's time at the bank from 2006 to 2009, writing that she: \"Nearly got sacked due to an expenses scandal where the 3 senior managers were all signing off each others expenses.\"",
      "Reeves's team vigorously denied the allegations.",
      "However, Labour's imminent victory in last summer's general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves.",
      "One former employee replied: \"the expenses dept certainly do!\"",
      "Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending.",
      "BBC News has been seeking the truth behind these suggestions, speaking to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues, and gaining access to receipts, emails and other documents.",
      "We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\" with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded.",
      "But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the bank's risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblower's allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Banking career",
      "Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006.",
      "The role required her to move north from London, where she had unsuccessfully stood as Labour's parliamentary candidate in what had been a safe Conservative seat.",
      "She initially worked in the mortgage department, but in late 2007 moved to become Head of Business Planning in the Customer Relations department, which handled complaints.",
      "Her career at HBOS coincided with what would prove to be a tumultuous time for the bank.",
      "The global financial crisis which began in late summer of 2007 would force the sector to embark on a massive programme of job cuts and cost savings.",
      "In September 2008, HBOS itself came close to collapse, requiring a government-brokered takeover by Lloyds and an emergency bailout which would total \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers' money.",
      "It was shortly after this near-collapse, by early 2009, that a whistleblower from her department raised concerns about the spending habits of Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was Reeves's boss.",
      "Reeves says she won't let critics get her down",
      "MPs raise questions about Rachel Reeves's CV",
      "Rachel Reeves: Playing Labour's first big gambit",
      "Before this, in late 2008, a memo was circulated to Reeves and others which called for tighter cost control in the department.",
      "Written by a planning and strategy manager, the document, \"Financial Risk Control within Customer Relations\", raised concerns about \"spending on travel\" and on corporate spending cards, including Motivation cards which were used to reward staff.",
      "It laid out proposals to \"improve cost controls\" which included monthly discussions with Reeves and another of the senior managers who the whistleblower claimed had mis-used expenses to \"give visibility of claims, invoices, Thanks card use and reports\".",
      "Separately, Reeves was emailed in mid-December 2008 about proposals for a presentation setting out how much had been spent on Motivation cards, recognising top performers and on taxi travel, to \"focus attention on particular aspects of travel that are costly and perhaps need more consideration\".",
      "Reeves replied to say that she was not sure a \"huge analysis\" was needed and she wanted to see the papers before they went any further.",
      "Whistleblower complaint and investigation",
      "The whistleblower's complaint submitted by early 2009 was a six-page document laying out a range of concerns about an alleged spending culture in the Customer Relations department.",
      "It focused on the behaviour of three individuals: Reeves, Reeves's boss, and another senior manager in the department. Reeves's boss, who we are not naming, was responsible for signing off the expenses of the other two managers.",
      "The report and attached receipts and other documents seen by BBC News show Reeves was accused of spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. Concern was also expressed about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. The whistleblower believed the spending to be excessive.",
      "After a call to the whistleblowing hotline, the whistleblower was instructed to hand in a physical copy of their report and supporting evidence, two sources said.",
      "A separate source, who contacted BBC News themselves in the wake of an article on the furore around Reeves's CV last year, was also aware that someone had blown the whistle on Reeves and another colleague.",
      "The report was passed to the bank's risk department and, at their request, was taken on by the Internal Audit department.",
      "A source who worked in risk at the bank told us: \"Given the nature of the allegations \u2013 claiming expenses for things you wouldn't normally claim expenses for \u2013 and the relative seniority of the individuals, the matter was referred for investigation by a team outside of that department.\"",
      "The Internal Audit department, which had access to expenses claims and sign-offs, then assessed the complaint and supporting documents, according to two sources.",
      "It found that there was evidence of apparent wrongdoing by the three senior managers including Reeves, a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation told BBC News.",
      "Internal Audit completed its involvement in the investigation and passed its findings to an investigative part of the Risk department in around April 2009. The normal process would then have been for the managers to be interviewed about the allegations. There would then be an assessment of potential disciplinary action if necessary.",
      "However it does not appear that this next interview stage took place, or that the investigation ever reached a formal conclusion. Reeves insisted she was never interviewed, as did her boss, who said she was \"not aware of an expenses probe and my departure was not related to any alleged investigation\". The other senior manager declined to comment.",
      "There is no evidence of which we are aware that the bank's internal investigation was completed, or that there was ever a concluding finding of any wrongdoing.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "They also provided a statement from the lawyer who provided legal advice on the compromise agreement - a voluntary legal document ending an employee's employment - she signed on her departure.",
      "He said it was a \"standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\".",
      "\"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process,\" he said.",
      "Expenses allegations",
      "What lay behind the whistleblower's complaint and the grumbles of other colleagues was unhappiness relating to several different areas of spending.",
      "One concern was the use of bank payment cards to pay for Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "\"A culture developed among senior managers in Customer Relations where gifts were given freely to direct reports  - both upwards and downwards,\" one former colleague of Reeves claimed.",
      "\"[They had] a very cavalier attitude regarding the budget in the department.\"",
      "Reeves and the other senior managers had both a corporate credit card and another payment card known as a 'Motivation' or 'Thanks' card.",
      "The Motivation card was intended to be used to reward high-performers for good work.",
      "There was guidance about its use. In February 2008 a memo instructed HBOS employees on the correct use of Motivation cards, which were widely used within the Customer Relations department.",
      "It stated that the cards were to be used to \"reward/acknowledge colleagues who have gone the extra mile\".",
      "Suggested gifts included \"chocolates, flowers, wine, vouchers or you could simply log on and send a free e-card to say 'Thanks' for a job well done\", the memo said.",
      "It warned that managers would be \"responsible for all transactions on your card and will be held accountable if spending on your statement cannot be verified\".",
      "Spending in this area was scrutinised because the company incurred tax on it.",
      "The memo doesn't explicitly prohibit Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "But 11 former employees told us they had never heard of colleagues being bought birthday gifts with the bank's money, and believed that doing so was in breach of the rules. Several said any birthday gifts were bought with their own money.",
      "However, one ex-staff member, Jane Wayper, a former HR business partner who was given permission to speak to us by Reeves's team, claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\" and \"staff were encouraged to do so for their teams\".",
      "Reeves bought birthday presents for colleagues with HBOS's money throughout her time in Customer Relations, receipts show, with purchases including wine and cosmetics. Some were bought using a Motivation card, while others were reimbursed through an expenses claim.",
      "She also spent \u00a3152 on a handbag and perfume as a present for her boss using the bank's money, according to the whistleblower's report. The present was a joint gift from Reeves and one of the other managers who was later investigated alongside her.",
      "And she bought earrings as a present for her PA, which she claimed back on expenses.",
      "Her PA, Linda Barrowclough, said she had received Christmas and birthday gifts from Reeves but had assumed they were \"personal gifts [and] they'd have come out of her own pocket\".",
      "Reeves also used her Motivation card to spend more than \u00a3400 on a leaving meal for a colleague, which the whistleblowing complaint claimed was not a permitted use.",
      "Christmas gifts",
      "The situation around Christmas gifts, which Reeves also bought for her PA and others, was more complicated.",
      "That's because, according to internal bank guidance we have seen, these could be bought on expenses providing they were small gifts of \u00a325 or less and they were not bought using the Motivation card.",
      "The \u00a325 limit was based on tax advice as anything more substantial would attract tax.",
      "It appeared to her colleagues that Reeves had broken these rules.",
      "But there does appear to have been confusion about the policy. We have also seen emails showing that Reeves was encouraged by her boss to buy more expensive Christmas presents, and to pay for them with her Motivation card.",
      "In late October 2008, Reeves's manager wrote that \"after checking with other departments, it looks like the standard practice of buying\u202fChristmas\u202fgifts for direct reports using motivation bank will continue this year\", emails seen by the BBC show.",
      "She suggested spending \u00a350 to \u00a375 per person on the presents.",
      "A reminder titled \"further clarity\" about how to buy Christmas gifts and how much to spend was circulated by another HBOS employee in early December, emails show.",
      "Reeves and the other managers who were later investigated were all among the recipients of this email confirming the rules on Christmas gifts.",
      "While seasonal gifts, such as at Christmas, were allowed, the managers were explicitly told they could not use Motivation cards for these purchases. The cost of these \"trivial\" gifts was also not allowed to exceed \u00a325, in line with\u202fHMRC guidance, the email said.",
      "This is because rewards for performance at work are taxable whereas seasonal gifts such as those given for Christmas, providing they are not too costly, are exempt.",
      "Replying to the email, Reeves wrote that she didn't understand why the \"goal posts are shifting\" and said she had already ordered and paid for her presents using \"Motivation Bank/Thanks, and I do not intend to cancel them,\" claiming this would cost more time and money.",
      "A colleague responsible for finance acknowledged that the message on paying for Christmas gifts hadn't always been clear but said: \"I don't believe that the goalposts are being moved.\"",
      "Receipts show that gifts bought by Reeves at Christmas 2008 included a \u00a349 handbag for her PA, while she herself received \u00a355 worth of wine from her boss.",
      "Open secret?",
      "There was a widespread belief at the bank that there had been an expenses investigation into Reeves and two colleagues.",
      "But Reeves has said that she has no recollection of being investigated or having questions raised over her expenses.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said she was \"proud of the work she did at HBOS\" and was not aware of the claims about her expenses until approached by the BBC.",
      "\"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way,\" she said.",
      "The spokesman also said Reeves left in 2009 \"on good terms and received a severance payment, including her full notice pay and bonus\".",
      "\"HBOS allowed her to keep a company car for six months after she left and she was given a favourable reference.\"",
      "Reeves's team put forward several former HBOS employees for interview who they said corroborated her account that she had not been investigated.",
      "One said she hadn't seen evidence of senior managers misusing expenses and the bank had controls to prevent it but she left in February 2008, more than a year before Reeves departed. She also said that she had never heard of giving birthday and Christmas gifts at HBOS's expense as being part of the bank's policies.",
      "Another, Jane Wayper, the former HR business partner, said in a statement that she didn't recognise the accusations against Reeves and \"would have been aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" as she would have been involved in the disciplinary process.",
      "She said there was \"extensive oversight of all expenses policies\" and claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\". But this is at odds with a document seen by BBC News and the testimony of 11 sources we have spoken to.",
      "Many of Reeves' former HBOS colleagues were worried about the consequences of sharing confidential information with BBC News but believe it is in the public interest for what happened, and their concerns about the now-Chancellor's spending of the bank's money, to be reported.",
      "But, given their concerns about speaking out publicly, we have agreed not to name them.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer still thought the Chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "The investigation at HBOS was not the last time Reeves would face scrutiny over her expenses.",
      "In 2015, it emerged that she was among 19 MPs who had had their official credit cards suspended by the parliamentary expenses watchdog after failing to show their spending was valid.",
      "Reeves owed more than \u00a34,000 in spending at the time when her card was blocked. She subsequently cleared her debt.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:42:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.",
      "Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.",
      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",
      "The use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.",
      "Trump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs",
      "UK not planning to hit back at US on steel tariffs",
      "UK signals it will seek US steel tariff exemption",
      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",
      "But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".",
      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",
      "Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".",
      "Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",
      "\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\""

      "She has previously told the BBC her mother would tick off items on a bank statement against receipts while sitting at the kitchen table: \"We weren't poor, but we didn't have money to waste.\"",
      "Her parents separated when she was at primary school, and she and younger sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes.",
      "During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering.",
      "They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives' houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money.",
      "Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and she has very much modelled herself on Gordon Brown\u2019s \"prudence\" in the lead-up to Labour\u2019s 1997 election win.",
      "Chess talent",
      "Reeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. She became a national under-14 champion, and would \"quietly thrash\" any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie.",
      "She has credited chess with teaching her \"to think ahead, to plan a strategy\".",
      "A keen flute player, she took her music GCSE a year early at Beckenham's Cator Park School for Girls, a comprehensive, and would go on to gain four A grades at A-level.",
      "Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of \"two pre-fab huts in the playground\", she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 16, she joined the Labour Party.",
      "She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student, she would host others before college discos, blasting out Destiny's Child songs and dressing up in her room.",
      "Despite her serious demeanour, colleagues and friends have suggested the Labour MP's public persona does not reflect her human side, including a loud laugh and a deep love of Beyonc\u00e9 tracks.",

      "Her career at HBOS has now come under scrutiny, after the BBC revealed Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at the bank.",
      "The initial stage of the HBOS investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "The BBC has not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was and it might not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Reeves has also faced questions about the accuracy of her online CV, which the BBC found exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and blamed an administrative error by the team.",
      "Last year, her LinkedIn profile was also changed to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",
      "It had previously claimed she worked as an economist at the bank, but she instead held a management role in the bank's customer relations department, which dealt with complaints.",

      "Entering Parliament in 2010, an early mentor on economic policy was Alistair Darling - the last Labour chancellor, during the financial crisis.",

      "Throughout Jeremy Corbyn's four and a half years as Labour leader, she remained on the backbenches because she felt she could not endorse his policies. Called a \"Red Tory\" by some in the party, she described this as a \"very unpleasant period\" in an interview with the BBC's Nick Robinson.",
      "A former editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme was forced to issue a written apology to Reeves after calling her \"boring snoring\" on social media in a post that was meant to be a private message.",
      "While she said the incident was \"deeply humiliating\", her key objective after Sir Keir Starmer appointed her shadow chancellor was to portray Labour as a steady, pro-business hand on the economy.",
      "In October 2023, she admitted she \"should have done better\" after it emerged some passages in her book, The Women Who Made Modern Economics, had been lifted from other sources without acknowledgment.",

      "Despite Labour's attempts to win over businesses during the election campaign, many were disappointed they bore the brunt of the \u00a340bn in tax rises announced in her first Budget.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:23:07 GMT",
    "summary": "They say the US should re-evaluate its cyber-security partnership with the UK unless the \"dangerous\" request is withdrawn.",
    "story": [
      "Two US lawmakers have strongly condemned what they call the UK's \"dangerous\"  and \"shortsighted\" request to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.",
      "Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Andy Biggs have written to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard saying the demand threatens the privacy and security of the US.",
      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the UK government for comment.",
      "\"While the UK has been a trusted ally, the US government must not permit what is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means\", the US politicians wrote.",
      "If the UK does not back down Ms Gabbard should \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing\", they suggest.",
      "What is the UK seeking?",
      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

    "story": [
      "Work on a number of new towns will begin before the next general election after more than 100 locations across England were put forward, Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook has pledged.",
      "The government says most proposals are to extend existing towns or cities, alongside a \"smaller number\" of new standalone settlements.",
      "The aim is for each new town to have at least 10,000 homes, contributing towards Labour's 1.5 million five-year housebuilding target.",
      "Each should include infrastructure like public transport and schools, alongside affordable housing, ministers say.",
      "A visit to Milton Keynes by the PM to promote the policy was cut short earlier when farmers driving tractors staged a noisy protest.",
      "Ministers desperately want more housing - but are their plans radical enough?",
      "What's the new government's housebuilding target?",

      "It is the latest in a series of protests mounted by farmers against changes to inheritance tax on farms announced at October's Budget.",
      "Creating a new generation of new towns is a key element of the government's long-term plan for housebuilding, and part of its efforts to unlock economic growth.",
      "More than 100 potential sites across England have been suggested to a special taskforce set up to examine the options, after the government asked for expressions of interest from councils, housing developers and landowners.",
      "The sites have not been revealed, but London, the South East, the South West and the east of England have proved the most popular \u2013 though there were expressions of interest from every region.",
      "The taskforce will identify specific locations - as well as funding options - by the summer, with a view to construction on the first sites beginning by the time of the next election.",
      "Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the aim was to build \"well-designed, affordable, attractive homes\" that would \"eventually house millions of people, just as the post-War waves of new towns did\".",
      "He described it as a \"transformational programme\" that he expected to \"make a contribution to housing numbers in this parliament\".",
      "However, speaking on Sky News, he conceded: \"These things take time to get off the ground. No one's pretending that the new towns programme is going to make up the bulk of that 1.5 million number.",
      "\"We're relying on the other changes we've made, including overhauling the national planning policy framework to get new sites coming through.\"",
      "He said he expected some of the construction to take place on greenfield - or undeveloped - land, but there would also be \"big expansions of existing towns and cities where that is appropriate\".",
      "\"There's got to be sustainable places, as I say, they've got to be well-connected, well-designed.\"",
      "The plan envisages an initial injection of government funding to buy land, which would be returned when sites were sold for a higher price to private developers, and would help pay for local infrastructure.",
      "Sir Keir said the construction of new towns would form part of \"the largest housebuilding programme since the post-war era\", and help offer \"working people...  the security and stability that owning your own home bring\".",

      "Shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said: \"Labour's housebuilding plans will do nothing to address the shortage of housing because immigration will just keep piling on the pressure.\"",
      "Spending review",
      "When the policy was originally unveiled at the party's conference in 2023, Labour set out a plan to use state-backed companies to construct a wave of new towns near English cities, echoing those built by Labour after World War Two.",
      "However, it is not clear how much public money will be allocated to the initiative.",
      "Pennycook told Today this would be decided in the government's spending review which will conclude in June and set spending plans for the next three years.",
      "The review, which is being conducted in a period of minimal economic growth against the backdrop of Labour's self-imposed fiscal constraints, will see ministers haggle for money for their departments.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told departments to identify 5% \"efficiency savings\" as part of the process, to ensure key services are prioritised for funding.",
      "Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Shelter, urged the government to provide \"serious investment\" in affordable social housing \"to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs\".",
      "\"New towns are a huge opportunity for the government to tackle housing need and provide local communities with homes they can actually afford to live in. The government must commit serious investment at the Spending Review in June to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs.\"",
      "Clement Attlee's 1945-51 government planned the first wave of new towns to relocate people from poor or bombed-out housing, with development corporations assigned responsibility for building them.",
      "Stevenage in Hertfordshire was the first such town created, with 10 others following by 1955, including Crawley in Sussex, Harlow in Essex, and Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.",
      "Most were intended to accommodate the overspill of people from London.",
      "Since the 1950s, Parliament has approved further developments in England, Scotland and Wales."

      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",

      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",

      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 10:53:57 GMT",
    "summary": "It comes after concerns over the High Court's capacity to hear each individual case in England and Wales.",
    "story": [
      "The assisted dying bill would be strengthened by plans for cases to be signed off by experts rather than a judge, the MP behind the law change has said.",
      "The proposed law for England and Wales currently says a High Court judge must check each person is eligible and has not been coerced into making the decision to die.",
      "But Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP proposing the bill, will suggest replacing this with a panel of experts who would oversee applications.",
      "It comes after concerns were raised over the court's capacity to hear each individual case.",
      "Leadbeater told the BBC adding \"extra expertise\" would improve the bill.",
      "But some opponents have criticised the move as watering down the bill's safeguards.",
      "Conservative MP Danny Kruger - a leading critic of the bill - said while he welcomed the idea of more experts being involved in the process, he questioned whether they would be impartial like a judge.",
      "He said concerns about the court's capacity to hear individual cases was \"a problem for the bill\", which should not be proceeding \"without adequate judicial safeguards\".",
      "Leadbeater said the panel of experts \"would be professional people doing a professional job\".",
      "She said some would say the bill now had \"too many safeguards\".",
      "\"I've had emails saying why are you making this so difficult? Because we must remember at the heart of this is a terminally ill person who wants choice,\" she added.",
      "If approved, the bill, which is currently being considered by MPs, would allow terminally ill adults expected to die within six months to seek help to end their own life.",
      "The new proposal will be voted on by a committee of MPs scrutinising the bill. The members were chosen by Leadbeater and the majority support the legislation.",
      "It comes as the committee begins the process of going through the bill line by line.",
      "Labour MP Paul Foster, who voted for the bill at second reading, called the change a \"game changer\" and said he was reconsidering his support.",
      "Foster told the BBC he will now wait until he sees the full bill before deciding whether to vote against it after committee stage.",
      "Doctors must raise other options to assisted dying, MP says",
      "What is assisted dying and how could the law change?",
      "How assisted dying has spread across the world and how laws differ",
      "Under Leadbeater's proposal, the panel reviewing each application would be chaired by a senior legal figure, but not necessarily a judge, and would also include experts such as psychiatrists and social workers. Their decision could, if necessary, be reviewed by the High Court.",
      "The panels would be chosen by a Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission, led by a High Court judge or senior former judge.",
      "The commission would oversee all cases for an assisted death and report annually on the number of applications and how many were approved and rejected.",
      "Ministers and officials have been closely consulted on the change, although the government technically remains neutral on the bill. Civil servants are drafting the amendment, which will be published later this week.",
      "Leadbeater argued this was not removing judicial scrutiny but changing it to a \"judge plus\" model.",
      "However, she previously hailed the role of the High Court as part of \"three layers of scrutiny\" that made it \"the strongest, most robust piece of legislation on this issue in the world\".",
      "The committee of MPs scrutinising the bill heard three days of oral evidence from experts two weeks' ago, including some who raised concerns about the proposed role of the High Court in signing off applications.",
      "Retired High Court judge Sir Nicholas Mostyn told the panel he thought it would be \"impossible\" for the High Court to rule in every assisted dying case.",
      "\"You're talking about nearly three quarters of the entire Family Division [Court] doing nothing but this,\" he said.",
      "He added it should be done \"by a panel set up... for each case, a doctor and a lawyer, they have to agree, and they check everything has been done lawfully\".",
      "Leadbeater said she agreed with the need for other professionals to be involved in the checks.",
      "\"This bill already contains the strongest safeguards anywhere in the world, but I promised to give close attention to the advice we have received on how the bill could be made even stronger, and that is what I have done,\" she said.",
      "However, Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Olney, who sits on the committee and oppose the bill, said the version of the legislation initially passed by the House of Commons in November \"specifically gave provision for a High Court judge\" to sign off cases \"and many MPs voted for it on that basis\".",
      "\"So to make this really profound change at this time makes it very, very difficult for the committee to decide whether this is the right thing or not in order to improve the bill,\" she told BBC Breakfast.",
      "More than 300 amendments have been tabled, with more expected in the coming weeks.",
      "Among those to be debated on Tuesday is one tabled by Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon to allow those with a neurodegenerative illness, such as Parkinson's, to access an assisted death with 12 months to live. The bill currently restricts assisted dying to those with a terminal illness with six months or less to live.",
      "Gordon told BBC News: \"This bill is about ensuring people facing painful deaths from terminal conditions can have the choice of how they die.",
      "\"For those with neurodegenerative conditions, in their last six months, it may be too late for them to engage in the process of applying.\"",
      "It is understood Leadbeater does not support expanding the scope of the bill to include those with 12 months to live.",
      "MPs backed proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales in November, by a majority of 55.",
      "However, it will be debated further by the House of Commons and Lords later in the year, and the final version requires the approval of both before it becomes law.",

      "Many in the industry are calling on Britain to join the EU and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy announced by US President Donald Trump on Monday.",
      "The tariffs, set to apply from 12 March, would mean any steel or aluminium coming into the US would be subject to an import tax worth 25% of its value.",
      "The US is the world's largest importer of steel, counting Canada, Brazil and Mexico as its top three suppliers, and Trump sees imposing tariffs, which will be paid by companies bringing the metal into the US, as a way of shifting away from foreign imports and boosting domestic steel production.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "Gareth Stace, director general of the industry body UK Steel, said Trump had taken a \"sledgehammer to free trade with huge ramifications for the steel sector in the UK and across the world\" as he called for \"stronger action\" from the government.",
      "\"Our high-quality products serve key US industries, many of which cannot source these domestically. This is a moment where our countries should work together to tackle global steel overproduction, not to be at loggerheads,\" he added.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This is because if other countries are no longer exporting to the US, they may look to offload their steel at a cheaper price, potentially leading to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",

      "Meanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"unjustified tariffs on the EU will not go unanswered\".",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson declined to say whether Trump was wrong to impose the tariffs.",
      "\"We will take a considered approach to this. We will engage with the US on the detail, but the government is clear we will work in our national interest and this issue is no different to that,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "Tariffs are paid by companies buying from overseas, not to the overseas companies selling to them.",
      "The importing company may choose to pass the cost on to customers directly or to absorb the cost themselves, or simply to reduce imports. Foreign exporters could also decide to cut their prices to protect sales.",
      "Trump introduced similar steel and aluminium tariffs in 2018 during his first term, but many countries, including the UK, were later able to work out exemptions.",
      "The US president has said he will not consider any exceptions this time round, although it seems like he may set this rule aside for Australia.",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Feb 2025 11:43:55 GMT",
    "summary": "As Peter Mandelson takes up the role of ambassador to the US, No 10 is determined the UK builds a strong relationship with Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "When Labour lost the 2010 election, rising star Ed Miliband was asked whether Peter Mandelson, who had just published a headline-grabbing autobiography, could play a role in the party's future.",
      "\"All of us,\" Miliband drily replied, \"believe in dignity in retirement.\"",
      "Mandelson winced and smiled at that quip, he later wrote. But ignored the advice.",
      "Fifteen years later, at the age of 71, the political veteran who helped mastermind Labour's renewal in the 1980s and 1990s, and was twice forced to resign from Tony Blair's government, has staged yet another comeback.",
      "\"It's a whirlwind,\" admits a member of his new team in Washington. \"Because he's a whirlwind kind of guy.\"",
      "The first political appointee to the role of UK ambassador to the United States in 50 years arrived in DC with a lot on his plate. Even by American standards.",
      "But why did Sir Keir Starmer recruit him, what explains Mandelson's hunger for the job, and how does he plan to charm Team Trump?",
      "\"Peter is supremely political,\" explains a Downing Street source. \"And this is a very political White House. He is a brilliant operator.\"",
      "Lord Mandelson has already moved into the ambassador's vast official residence, recently refurbished at a cost of \u00a3118.8m.",
      "His new life will involve more than Congressional meetings and cocktail parties. He now oversees 800 UK staff in the country many of whom are seconded to the Pentagon and defence bases.",
      "At the embassy, beneath a Warhol portrait of the late Queen, Mandelson has already hosted lunch for General Keith Kellogg, President Trump's envoy to Ukraine and Russia.",
      "This was merely a warm up for the real challenge later this month: accompanying Keir Starmer to the Oval Office to meet President Trump.",
      "My criticism of Trump was wrong, says Mandelson",
      "Peter Mandelson: How the Prince of Darkness became his excellency",
      "Peter Mandelson 'honoured' to be appointed US ambassador",
      "The new president may be erratic and impulsive yet No 10 officials are determined the two leaders will develop a strong relationship despite their differing personalities.",
      "\"The PM will be asking Peter: 'How on earth do I handle this crazy guy?',\" says a former colleague.",
      "\"As an ambassador in the court of Donald Trump you need someone who can tickle him under his chin. Peter will be the absolute fixer and bridge builder.\"",
      "Unlike the imminent turnover of leaders in continental Europe (Mandelson's long friendship with Emmanuel Macron is no longer so helpful), Starmer and Trump are likely to be in office and working together for the next four years.",
      "One official says part of the UK's pitch is about emphasising that both men are winners: \"Our message to him is we won big in July. You won big in November. Let's do business together.\"",
      "Mandelson has regularly provided advice to Keir Starmer in recent years and acted as an unofficial mentor to the PM's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and director of communications Matthew Doyle.",
      "These relationships suggest Downing Street and the US embassy will have an unusually close and constant level of contact.",
      "In an administration where billionaire businessmen have unprecedented influence, Peter Mandelson's contacts from his time as EU trade commissioner, UK business secretary, and via his international lobbying firm Global Counsel is already being deployed. \"He's essentially been a businessman for the last 15 years,\" says a source.",
      "In conversations with Trump, Mandelson could drop the names of numerous mutual friends: he knows Peter Thiel, the right-wing billionaire backer of vice president JD Vance, and Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape, who is on the board of Meta.",
      "Mandelson has met Elon Musk, holidayed with Trump's new Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and built a relationship with Mark Burnett, the TV producer behind The Apprentice who is now Trump's special envoy to the UK.",
      "Yet Mandelson's expertise in charming these elites (former President George W. Bush nicknamed him 'Silvertongue'), and his penchant for luxury have also led to problems throughout his career.",
      "\"He has weaknesses,\" says one longtime friend. \"He likes the high life. A lifestyle he can't afford.\"",
      "Peter Mandelson's friendship with Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska during his time at the EU provoked questions about conflicts of interest - Mandelson had stayed on Deripaska's yacht. The European Commission cleared him of wrongdoing.",
      "A name Mandelson will likely not drop in Trump's company is that of their late former friend Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Both knew the billionaire paedophile who died by suicide in 2019. Mandelson maintained a relationship with him even after Epstein signed a plea deal in 2008 and served an 18-month jail term for soliciting sex from girls as young as 14.",
      "Epstein is said to have referred to Mandelson as \"Petie\". Photographs released in court documents show Mandelson trying on a belt alongside Epstein in a clothing shop, and the pair blowing out candles on a birthday cake.",
      "Lord Mandelson has said he \"deeply regrets\" both ever meeting Epstein and the hurt caused to his many victims, and has also said that he never had any kind of professional or business relationship with him. But in an interview with the Financial Times this week, the diplomat also added: \"I'm not going to go into this\", and swore explosively at the interviewer.",
      "That undiplomatic language was a rare media misstep and contrasts with No 10's expectation that Mandelson will be a far safer pair of hands with journalists than his predecessor, outgoing ambassador Dame Karen Pierce.",
      "\"Karen just wasn't reliable enough for broadcast,\" one senior insider tells me. Starmer aides want Mandelson to regularly appear on US TV, including Trump's favoured channel Fox News.",
      "Dame Karen's glittering career as a diplomat may have meant she had less experience of television, but her expertise in national security and persistence in charming Trump's allies paid dividends.",
      "So much so that Donald Trump's co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita objected to Sir Keir replacing a \"professional universally respected ambo [ambassador] with an absolute moron\".",
      "Dame Karen stood out in the largely male and often stale world of Washington in her colourful tailor-made suits, occasionally complemented with a feather boa.",
      "As she packed her bags, at one farewell event she was presented with a commemorative champagne sabre engraved with the words \"always the Dame of DC\".",
      "Swapping a beltway bon vivant for the so-called Prince of Darkness is, however, a risk.",
      "Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts with clients of Mandelson's lobbying firm Global Counsel, which have included Shell and China-linked companies like TikTok. He resigned from Global Counsel's board last summer but remains a shareholder.",
      "Mandelson has already appeared on Fox News to apologise for his previous criticism of Donald Trump. He said his claims that the president was \"a bully\" were \"ill-judged and wrong\".",
      "Friends say the new ambassador is well aware that even before he arrived in the US capital he had other prominent detractors like Steve Bannon, Trump's former top adviser who called his appointment a \"terrible pick\".",
      "Mandelson's diplomatic strategy so far involves dividing Trumpworld into three groups and approaching them in different ways. The groups are: ideological MAGA (Trump's campaign mantra Make America Great Again), national security MAGA, and the technocracy.",
      "The first of these groups includes Bannon and may be the trickiest to mollify.",
      "\"They want to do as much damage as possible to Starmer and the UK/US relationship,\" says a diplomat. \"And they want to discredit Peter.\"",
      "Mandelson privately considers himself a foreign policy hawk so is more optimistic about his luck with group two: national security MAGA. These officials are more anti-Putin than others in the president's orbit, and they could be helpful when discussing policy on Ukraine, Russia and China.",
      "Group three - the technocracy - should also be open to the ambassador's advances. Mandelson wants the signature policy of his time in Washington to be a technological partnership involving AI and quantum computing.",
      "\"So Western nations and economies retain a technological edge over our adversaries,\" explains one involved.",
      "Before all that, the most pressing priority for the UK is avoiding trade tariffs.",
      "To help smooth the path, Mandelson's team have pointedly decided to frame their interactions with the White House in America First terms.",
      "\"We have a balanced trading relationship with America,\" insists one British diplomat.",
      "\"We'll be demonstrating where the UK partnership adds value to America not just saying 'this is good for Britain'.\"",
      "As the president floats unconventional and controversial ideas, one key UK tactic will be to simply stay out of the President's firing line.",
      "\"We're not getting involved,\" is a regular refrain from Downing Street.",
      "On Monday, Lord Mandelson will present his diplomatic credentials (a formal letter from King Charles) at the State Department.",
      "He is understood to already be planning how best to deploy his ultimate line manager with officials considering inviting the president on a second state visit to London.",
      "President Trump appeared to revel in a recent meeting with Prince William, who he said \"looks better in person\".",
      "Trump also insists, without evidence, he was Elizabeth II's favourite president.",
      "One minister jokes that when the prime minister visits the White House later this month he should take \"something from the Buckingham Palace gift shop\u2026 Maybe give Trump a royal family colouring-in book\".",
      "Forty years after he became Labour's director of research and communications, Peter Mandelson is back at the heart of British politics.",
      "As to why he still has the hunger for high office, one friend points to the four years he spent in the political wilderness after resigning from Tony Blair's government for the second time in 2001.",
      "That bruising experience, they argue, left him feeling unfulfilled and desperate to prove himself.",
      "\"He should have been foreign secretary,\" says the friend. \"Instead in those years he sat at home watching his contemporaries and intellectual inferiors on Newsnight.\"",
      "Another ally characterises Lord Mandelson's ambition in simpler terms: he has an insatiable thirst for power.",
      "\"Peter's great mission in life\", they say, \"is to stay relevant.\"",

      "The number of foreign workers seeking help over claims of exploitation, bullying, underpayment and poor living conditions on UK farms significantly increased last year, the BBC has learned.",
      "Nearly 700 foreign seasonal agricultural labourers complained to the Worker Support Centre (WSC) charity in 2024 they were being treated unfairly by farmers who had brought them over to work, compared to just over 400 in 2023.",
      "One former fruit picker told the BBC more must be done to protect migrants from being treated like slaves.",
      "The UK government said it always took \"decisive action\" if abusive practices were found on farms.",
      "Bolivian Julia Quecano Casimiro came to the UK on a seasonal worker visa to pick cherries for Haygrove, a Herefordshire-based farm business.",
      "Ms Casimiro is currently taking the company to an employment tribunal over claims of unfair dismissal, discrimination and underpayment of wages, and now campaigns for better protection for seasonal farm workers.",
      "In an initial ruling, the Home Office found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Ms Casimiro could have been a victim of modern slavery.",
      "She told the BBC she feared the true scale of exploitation of workers was a \"hidden problem\", adding: \"Many seasonal workers continue to have their rights violated at this very moment.",
      "\"What is happening is very serious because we don't have access to any assistance or support.",
      "\"If the UK government does not take action to stop what is happening there will continue to be more victims of modern slavery.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for Haygrove said Ms Casimiro's discontent was prompted by a discrepancy in the face value of flight tickets and the amount loaned to workers for the tickets, and lower than typical hours of work available in the month of July, as a result of extraordinary weather conditions.",
      "The company added that her allegations are \"materially incorrect and misleading\" and that it has \"never had accusations of this nature before in the history of our business\".",
      "It told the BBC that its practices \"are routinely audited by a range of third-party bodies, including by the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority (GLAA), the Home Office, the British Retail Consortium, Red Tractor/Assured Produce, LEAF, Soil Association and SEDEX\".",
      "The company said Ms Casimiro worked at Hayford for 11 days before leaving with a free air ticket home, and her claims were based on a \"short-lived, snapshot, atypical experience\".",
      "\"We take great care in ensuring fairness and equality in our recruitment and working processes,\" the spokeswoman added.",
      "'Deeply concerned'",
      "The company said it is also co-operating with a nationwide GLAA investigation into how companies recruited 20 Indonesian workers.",
      "Last summer, those workers claimed they were charged illegal fees to come to the UK by recruitment agencies abroad.",

      "A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.",
      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",
      "Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.",
      "Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present.",
      "\"The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,\" he said.",
      "\"You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.\""

    "story": [
      "A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations that energy giant Shell has ignored repeated warnings that a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria has been beset by problems and corruption.",
      "The multinational headquartered in London, along with the Nigerian government, has repeatedly stated that work to clean up oil-contaminated sites of Ogoniland, which kicked off around eight years ago, is going well.",
      "But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (\u00a3805m), has been suffering from a string of issues.",
      "One close observer has described the clean-up project as a \"con\" and a \"scam\" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation.",
      "Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: \"The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft.",
      "\"When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities.\"",
      "The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure.",
      "The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health.",
      "Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims.",
      "It denies wrongdoing and says spills in the region have been caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining for which the company says it is not liable.",

      "The UN says at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents in the Niger Delta region.",
      "The spills have left many families worried for their health and livelihoods.",

      "Her family and neighbours only have access to a contaminated borehole, forcing them to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, \u00a32.40) - in an area where the average daily wage is less than $8.",
      "It is a familiar story to many in Niger Delta's Rivers state.",
      "Paulina Agbekpekpe told the BBC that lush greenery once surrounded thriving mangroves of her community in Bodo - which is not one of those going to court on Thursday. She said the rivers and ponds used to brim with all kinds of animals and fish, particularly periwinkle.",
      "\"The place was greener, not only mangroves, but all by the shoreline - there were pawpaw trees, palm trees and more. But during the spills, the destruction has polluted everywhere,\" the 50-year-old mother of six said.",
      "Her family had for generations survived on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago.",
      "\"Most of the children - from the drinking water - have got diseases. Many have died. I've lost eight kids. My husband is sick.",
      "\"Because our livelihoods have been taken away, people in Bodo are hungry and suffering.\"",
      "In 2011, the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP) published a major study into the impact of pollution on the oil-rich area.",
      "It found members of one community in Ogoniland were drinking water contaminated with a known carcinogen at levels more than 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The same chemical, benzene, was detected in all their air samples.",
      "It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements.",
      "The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).",
      "This was initially established by the Nigerian government in 2012, but no clean-up was started - until it was relaunched by a new government in December 2016.",
      "Hyprep was part-funded by oil companies including the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, which gave $350m.",
      "However, the BBC has seen internal documents that suggest representatives of Shell and of the Nigerian government were warned numerous times of the agency's alleged fraudulent practices.",

      "In a separate leaked report seen by the BBC from the same year, it was pointed out that laboratory results were \"regularly reported with deviations\".",
      "In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the \"extremely poor standards\" of the clean-up would continue.",
      "The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response.",
      "But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems.",
      "In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the \"institutional challenges\" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of \"future funding\" towards it.",
      "Shell told the BBC: \"Hyprep is an agency established and overseen by the federal government of Nigeria, with its governing council largely made up of senior ministers and government officials, along with five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single SPDC representative.\"",
      "This is not the only remediation project in the Niger Delta that is alleged to have been botched.",
      "In 2015, Shell agreed to a \u00a355m settlement for a clean-up after two catastrophic spills in 2008 from its infrastructure in the area Bodo.",
      "The company said the clean-up, conducted by the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is meant to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and the Bodo community (and is part-funded by the oil giant and Nigerian regulators) has been certified as 98% complete.",
      "However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters.",
      "Shell and the BMI insist any occurrences of oil spills in the region are because of theft - known in the industry as \"oil bunkering\".",
      "\"There is a plan to call back the contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,\" Boniface Dumpe, a director at the BMI, told the BBC.",
      "\"It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of their facilities, to ensure that re-oiling does not come from their facilities.",
      "\"But for the areas that have been cleaned. I would think that some responsibility is also for the community to ensure that some illegal activities does not also cause re-pollution.\"",
      "Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering.",
      "The company said: \"We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.\"",
      "The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.",
      "Some locals have accused the oil giant of \"running away\" from properly cleaning up the land and waters it is alleged to have polluted.",
      "They also fear Shell may still profit from the area by simply trading the oil extracted from the region in future.",
      "\"The operations of whichever oil operator takes over the relevant pipelines will have an enormous impact on their day-to-day life,\" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, told the BBC.",
      "\"There's incredibly little detail about what these deals will lead to.",

      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",

      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",

      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",

      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",

      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

    "story": [
      "The four British families suing TikTok for the alleged wrongful deaths of their children have accused the tech giant of having \"no compassion\".",
      "In an exclusive group interview for BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the parents said they were taking the company to court to try to find out the truth about what happened to their children and seek accountability.",
      "The parents believe their children died after taking part in a viral trend that circulated on the video-sharing platform in 2022.",
      "TikTok says it prohibits dangerous content and challenges. It has blocked searches for videos and hashtags related to the particular challenge the children's parents say is linked to their deaths.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the US on Thursday, claims that Isaac Kenevan, 13, Archie Battersbee, 12, Julian \"Jools\" Sweeney, 14, and Maia Walsh, 13, died while attempting the so-called \"blackout challenge\".",
      "The complaint was filed in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware by the US-based Social Media Victims Law Center on behalf of Archie's mother Hollie Dance, Isaac's mum Lisa Kenevan, Jools' mother Ellen Roome and Maia's dad Liam Walsh.",
      "In the interview, Ms Kenevan accused TikTok of breaching \"their own rules\". In the lawsuit, the families claim that the platform breached the rules in a number of ways,   including around not showing or promoting dangerous content that could cause significant physical harm.",
      "Ms Dance said that the bereaved families were brushed off with \"the same corporate statement\" showing \"no compassion at all - there's no meaning behind that statement for them\".",
      "Ms Roome has been campaigning for legislation that would allow parents to access the social media accounts of their children if they die. She has been trying to obtain data from TikTok that she thinks could provide clarity around his death.",
      "Ms Kenevan said they were going to court to pursue \"accountability - they need to look not just at us, but parents around the world, not just in England, it's the US and everywhere\".",
      "\"We want TikTok to be forthcoming, to help us - why hold back on giving us the data?\" Ms Kenevan continued. \"How can they sleep at night?\"",
      "'No faith' in government efforts",
      "Mr Walsh said he had \"no faith\" that the UK government's efforts to protect children online would be effective.",
      "The Online Safety Act is coming into force this spring. But Mr Walsh said, \"I don't have faith, and I'm about to find out if I'm right or wrong. Because I don't think it's baring its teeth enough. I would be forgiven for having no faith - two and a half years down the road and having no answers.\"",
      "Ms Roome said that she was grateful for the support she had from the other bereaved parents. \"You do have some days particularly bad - when it's very difficult to function,\" she said.",
      "The families' lawsuit against TikTok and its parent company ByteDance claims the deaths were \"the foreseeable result of ByteDance's engineered addiction-by-design and programming decisions\", which it says were \"aimed at pushing children into maximizing their engagement with TikTok by any means necessary\".",
      "And the lawsuit accuses ByteDance of having \"created harmful dependencies in each child\" through its design and \"flooded them with a seemingly endless stream of harms\".",
      "\"These were not harms the children searched for or wanted to see when their use of TikTok began,\" it claims.",
      "Searches for videos or hashtags related to the challenge on TikTok are blocked, a policy the company says has been in place since 2020.",
      "TikTok says it prohibits dangerous content or challenges on the platform, and directs those who search for hashtags or videos to its Safety Centre. The company told the BBC it proactively finds and removes 99% of content that breaks its rules before it is reported.",
      "TikTok says it has met with Ellen Roome to discuss her case. It says the law requires it to delete personal data, unless there is a valid request from law enforcement prior to the data being deleted."

      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",

      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",

      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",

      "Zelensky posted footage on X appearing to show damage to the giant shield, made of concrete and steel, which covers the remains of the reactor that lost its roof in the explosion.",
      "The shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century. It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and cost $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) to construct.",

      "The shield \"was never built to withstand external drone attack\", he told the BBC.",
      "Instead, it is a \"complex piece of decommissioning kit\" built to contain the radioactive materials inside and to help safely deconstruct the broken reactor.",
      "The strike appeared to hit the maintenance system of a crane designed to remotely take the reactor apart, he said.",
      "There appears to be \"pretty serious\" damage to the outer and inner cladding, he added. But a fuller assessment of the damage will be needed before the bank can determine its costs.",

    "summary": "Some states restrict access for women following the overturning of Roe v Wade.",
    "story": [
      "Infant mortality rates have increased in US states which have enacted abortion bans following the landmark ruling overturning the nationwide right for women to access the procedure, a new study has found.",
      "Researchers estimate there were an estimated 478 infant deaths across 14 states with bans or heavy restrictions on the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy - which they say would not have occurred had they not been in place.",
      "Alison Gemmill, co-leader of the study, said \"restrictive abortion policies\" could be \"reversing decades of progress\" in reducing infant deaths across the US.",
      "In its 2022 ruling, the US Supreme Court reversed its 50-year-old Roe v Wade decision which had protected a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy up until the point of foetal viability, around the 24th week.",
      "The study, published this week by researchers from the John Hopkin's Bloomberg School of Public Health, found an increase in mortality rates for babies born with congenital issues, as well as among groups where death rates already were higher than average.",
      "This included black infants, as well as for babies whose parents were unmarried, younger, did not attend college, and for those living in southern states.",
      "As of January 2025, 17 states have outlawed nearly all abortions, though some have narrow exceptions for cases of rape, incest or the health of the mother.",
      "States with some form of total abortion ban are Idaho, Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.",
      "Florida, Georgia, Iowa and South Carolina ban the procedure beyond six weeks of pregnancy.",
      "Meanwhile, there are bans in place in Nebraska and North Carolina for procedures after 12 weeks, while it is 18 weeks in Utah.",
      "Congenital malformations",
      "In the states which opted to enact the new laws, infant mortality rates increased to 6.26 per 1,000 live births, compared with an expected rate of 5.93 per 1,000 - a relative increase of 5.6%.",
      "In the UK, the infant mortality rate is estimated at around 3.8 per 1,000 live births. Slovenia, Singapore and Iceland have among the world's lowest infant mortality rates, at between 1.5-1.6 deaths per 1,000 live births.",
      "Afghanistan currently has the world's highest rate, with an estimated 101.3 deaths every 1,000 live births.",
      "The study also found an increase in the number of infant deaths in the US from congenital anomalies, rising from an expected 1.24 per 1,000 live births to 1.37 per 1,000 - a relative increase of 10.87%.",
      "Mortality from other causes rose to 4.89 per 1,000 from an expected 4.69, a 4.23% increase.",
      "Among non-Hispanic black infants, there were 11.81 deaths per 1,000 live births after the bans, compared to an expected rate of 10.66 per 1,000, an increase of nearly 11%.",
      "According to the research, the increase in infant mortality due to congenital malformations was consistent with women being denied abortions for non-viable pregnancies - where a pregnancy cannot possibly result in a liveborn baby.",
      "But the increase due to non-congenital causes \"is less straightforward\", researchers say.",
      "The study also found the ban may be disproportionately impacting disadvantaged populations who are already at a higher risk of infant mortality as well as delays in receiving medical care.",
      "Separate research from John Hopkin's Bloomberg School of Public Health found that abortion bans were also linked to increased fertility rates.",
      "Following the overturning of Roe v Wade, which returned control over the procedure back to individual states, researchers found that the number of births per 1,000 reproductive-aged females in affected states rose by 1.7%, or 22,180.",

      "\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said.",
      "\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"",

      "War-weary Palestinians in Gaza said they had been alarmed by the prospect of a return to fighting after 16 months of devastating war.",
      "\"When the truce was announced, we felt immense joy. However, with the announcement of a new crisis, fear returned [and] traders began raising commodity prices,\" Mouti al-Qedra told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme.",
      "\"I pray to God constantly for lasting peace, especially after the martyrdom of 65 members of the al-Qedra family. Now, we are relieved that the crisis has been resolved, hoping no more martyrs will fall.\"",
      "The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza.",
      "So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal.",
      "The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named.",
      "Negotiations for the ceasefire's second phase - which should see the 43 remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun.",
      "The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day.",
      "The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.",
      "More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter."

    "story": [
      "The US will be present at talks over the future of the Chagos Islands, which has been the subject of a controversial deal between Mauritius and the UK, the Mauritian prime minister has said.",
      "Last October, the UK announced it would hand over sovereignty of the islands,  known officially as the British Indian Ocean Territory, to Mauritius but would maintain a 99-year lease over the UK-US military airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia.",
      "The deal was reached with former Mauritian leader Pravind Jugnauth, but Navin Ramgoolam, his replacement, has been very critical.",
      "Progress has also been delayed to allow officials from incoming President Donald Trump's team to look at the details of the deal.",
      "The agreement struck in October - which had been greenlit by the Biden administration - includes the UK paying lease payments to Mauritius for the UK-US military airbase.",
      "However, shortly after the deal was struck, Mauritius elected a new prime minister, Navin Ramgoolam, who wanted to reopen negotiations.",

      "He also objected to a clause where the UK could unilaterally extend the lease on Diego Garcia for another 40 years.",
      "It is unclear what the US stance on the deal is exactly, but last year, before he was in office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it posed a \"serious threat\", arguing it gives the islands to a country aligned with China. Mauritius has a trade agreement with China.",

      "Foreign workers are typically lured to these scam centres by offers of good salaries, or in some cases tricked into thinking they will be doing different work in Thailand, not Myanmar.",

      "Some are willing to do the work, but others are forced to stay, with release only possible if their families pay  large ransoms. Some of those who have escaped have described being tortured.",
      "The released foreign workers were handed over by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, one of several armed factions which control territory inside Karen State.",

      "The BBC visited Shwe Kokko at the invitation of Yatai, the company which built the city.",
      "Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour is not allowed, and that \"online businesses\" should leave.",
      "But we were told by local people that the scam business was still running, and interviewed a worker who had been employed in one.",
      "Like the DKBA, Saw Chit Thu broke away from the main Karen insurgent group, the KNU, in 1994, and allied himself to the Myanmar military.",
      "Under pressure from Thailand and China, both Saw Chit Thu and the DKBA have said they are expelling the scam businesses from their territories.",
      "The DKBA commander contacted a Thai member of parliament on Tuesday to arrange the handover of the 260 workers.",
      "They included 221 men and 39 women, from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Nepal, Uganda, Laos, Burundi, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Tanzania, Sir Lanka, India, Ghana and Cambodia.",

    "summary": "The leaders share a warm relationship, but both will have their own wish list when they meet this week.",
    "story": [
      "When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Washington and meets President Donald Trump later on Thursday, there will be some warm hugs and shared laughs. But that will not be all.",
      "Trump and Modi have developed a strong personal rapport over the years, marked by high-profile meetings and joint appearances. This time, they will also hold a joint press briefing, according to the White House.",
      "Since their first meeting in Washington in 2017, their bond has grown through other events, including joint appearances at massive rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad. Their chemistry stems from shared worldviews and politics and a mutual strategic focus on countering China, a concern that has also strengthened the broader US-India partnership.",
      "Not surprisingly, Trump has often criticised India, but he has never criticised Modi.",
      "And so, during Modi's visit, the two leaders will probably spend time mapping out next steps in the US-India strategic partnership, which is already in a good place.",
      "Modi will reportedly meet several members of Trump's cabinet, as well as US business leaders and members of the Indian-American community.",
      "He may also meet SpaceX and Tesla chief Elon Musk. Modi, keen to scale up India's burgeoning electric vehicles sector, would be happy if Musk opened a Tesla factory in India.",
      "And yet the Trump-Modi conviviality and heady talk of strategic partnership may mask a sobering reality: during Modi's visit, the relationship's transactional side will come into sharp relief with each leader, especially Trump, armed with an array of demands.",
      "Delhi knows Trump well. Many of Modi's current cabinet ministers also served during his previous term, which overlapped with part of the first Trump administration. That familiarity has been on display since Trump's inauguration last month: Delhi has publicly signalled its willingness to lower tariffs, take back undocumented Indian immigrants and buy American oil.",
      "It has already lowered some tariffs and taken back 104 undocumented Indians, with the first plane arriving in India last week. These pre-emptive steps are meant to prevent Trump from making specific demands of India and to reduce the likelihood of tensions with the new Trump administration.",
      "Still, Trump may ask Modi to make additional tariff reductions, to further chip away at a US goods and services trade deficit with India that has approached $46bn (\u00a337.10bn) in recent years.",
      "On Wednesday evening, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Trump planned to announce reciprocal tariffs on other countries before his meeting with Modi.",
      "But an obstacle could become an opportunity: Modi may call on Trump to enter into bilateral talks on an economic partnership accord meant to reduce tariffs on both sides.",
      "In recent years, Delhi has shown a growing willingness to pursue trade deals. The Trump administration may prove to be a more willing interlocutor than the Biden administration, which imposed heavy environmental and labour-related conditions on new trade agreements.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Trump may also ask Modi to take back more undocumented Indians. Given that some estimates put the number at more than 700,000 - the third-largest such group in the US - this will be a difficult and delicate issue for Delhi to navigate.",
      "Last week, India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar told parliament that the government was working with the US to ensure Indian citizens were not mistreated while being deported after reports of them being shackled sparked anger.",
      "Trump may also call on Modi to buy more American oil.",
      "In 2021, India was the top destination for American oil exports, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine brought major changes in global oil markets and prompted Delhi to ramp up imports of cheap oil from close partner Russia. The price point will determine how much oil India is willing to buy from the US.",
      "Modi may also come with his own energy ask: invest in Indian nuclear energy. Delhi is amending its nuclear liability law and has announced a new nuclear energy mission, in an attempt to sharpen international interest in the fuel.",
      "India aims to meet half its energy requirements through renewable energy by 2030. Asking Trump to invest in nuclear fuel amounts to a potential happy medium: it is cleaner than fossil fuels, but far removed from the solar and wind power that may not strike the Trump administration as an attractive investment.",
      "Technology will probably be discussed as well.",
      "This was a fast-growing space for bilateral relations in the Biden era, thanks to the 2022 implementation of the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET), which both sides view as a new cornerstone for strategic partnership. iCET is meant to be directly overseen by the two national security advisers - to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucracy - which means they must each be personally invested in it.",
      "Modi will likely seek assurances from Trump and his National Security Adviser Mike Waltz that they remain committed to this. Given Washington's focus on countering China by making India a bigger part of tech global supply chains, they probably will.",
      "Also on the tech co-operation front, Modi may make a pitch for Trump to maintain the H-1B visa regime. These visas for highly skilled foreign workers, heavily criticised by some influential Trump supporters, have been awarded to large numbers of Indian tech employees in the US.",
      "Other countries may also come up during Modi's conversations in Washington. Iran could loom especially large.",
      "Delhi is partnering with Tehran to develop a port in Chabahar city - part of a broader Indian strategy to strengthen connectivity links with Central Asia, via Iran and Afghanistan. But last week, the US administration released a presidential memorandum outlining Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign on Tehran, which hints at removing sanctions waivers for those conducting commercial activities in Chabahar. Modi may seek clarity on what this means for Delhi.",
      "Trump may also gauge Modi's position on a big foreign policy priority: ending the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Delhi has a strong interest in these wars winding down. Modi's position on the war in Ukraine - calling for an end to the conflict without criticising Putin or Russia - echoes that of Trump.",
      "India's special relationship with Russia and close ties with Israel may prompt Trump to see if Modi would want to play a third-party mediator role as well. Modi would probably be comfortable doing so only if the parties are receptive to outside mediation.",
      "But despite some potentially delicate discussions this week, both leaders will want to maintain a positive tone.",
      "In that regard, the Indo-Pacific Quad will be just what the doctor ordered.",
      "Trump strongly backs this group which consists of the US, India, Japan and Australia and focuses on countering Beijing.",
      "In his first term, Trump elevated the Quad's annual meetings to the foreign minister level and Biden elevated them further to the leaders' level.",
      "India is scheduled to host this year's Quad meeting and Modi may invite Trump to Delhi to attend this.",
      "Trump reportedly is not a big fan of international travel but India is a trip he will probably be keen to make - to deepen his personal relationship with Modi and to advance a multifaceted bilateral partnership that extends well beyond the transactionalism that will carry the day in Washington this week.",

      "His job is demanding, with crowds swelling during the peak tourist season, but the financial rewards have always made it worthwhile. This year he fears that won't be the case.",

      "He adds that the government has responded positively, but \"it remains to be seen whether these measures will be implemented\".",
      "While Greek authorities have been quick to respond to the risks posed by the tremors - placing rescue teams on Santorini and introducing a state of emergency to expedite aid - some in the tourism industry argue that this needs to be followed up with investment in the island's infrastructure.",
      "\"The challenges won't disappear once the earthquakes stop,\" says Margarita Karamolegkou, who owns four hotels in Santorini.",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.",
      "Cheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.",
      "Now, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.",
      "\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.",
      "\"That's what we want.\"",
      "Mr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years.

      "The loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.",
      "Before the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.",
      "\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"",

      "But studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line.

They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.",
      "\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.",
      "Before the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.",

      "They recounted how the hostages were held in underground tunnels and buildings, witnessed physical abuse and were made to participate in Hamas propaganda videos, including, in one case, by faking her own death.",
      "They said the women found strength through sharing stories, drawing and keeping a diary.",
      "None of the women have given interviews to the media since their release, and their parents say the full details of what they endured are still emerging. There are also things they can't speak about due to fears it could put the hostages still in Gaza at risk.",
      "Three of the four women whose parents spoke to the BBC were female soldiers kidnapped by Hamas from the Nahal Oz army base near Gaza on 7 October 2023.",
      "The hostages' access to food and their treatment by male guards varied over the 15 months they were held, their parents said. They were moved between locations, rarely seeing sunlight.",
      "\"It was very different between the places that she went - it could be a good tunnel, it could be a very bad tunnel. It could be a good house or a bad house,\" said the father of Agam Berger, 20, a soldier who had been at Nahal Oz.",
      "Some of the places had good food, some had \"very bad food... they just tried to survive,\" Shlomi Berger said.",
      "\"They [and their captors] had to run away from one place to another because they are in a war zone there. It was very dangerous to be there,\" said Orly Gilboa, whose daughter Daniella was also kidnapped from the base.",
      "When Daniella watched the release of three male hostages last week - who came out thin and emaciated - she told her mother: \"If I had been released two months ago I would have probably looked like them.\"",
      "\"She got thinner, she lost a lot of her weight through the captivity. But in the last two months they were given a lot of food to gain weight,\" Ms Gilboa says.",
      "Other parents have also reported significant weight loss. Meirav Leshem Gonen's daughter was taken by Hamas from the Nova music festival.",
      "Romi, 24, was released in the first week of the ceasefire in January - she had lost \"20% of her body weight\", says her mother.",
      "Ms Gilboa says the hardest thing she endured was seeing a video that suggested her daughter had been killed. Her captors poured powder on her so she looked like she was covered in plaster, as if she was killed in an Israeli military strike.",
      "\"I think everyone who saw it believed it, but I just kept telling myself that it can't be,\" she told the BBC.",
      "The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage.",
      "More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been destroyed or damaged, estimates the UN.",
      "So far, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been exchanged for more than 600 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel under the ceasefire deal that began on 19 January.",
      "Mr Berger says his daughter, Agam, was threatened by her captors and witnessed physical abuse while in captivity.",
      "\"Sometimes they tortured other female hostages in front of her eyes,\" he says, referring specifically to an assault on Amit Soussana, a former hostage who was released in November 2023.",
      "Mr Berger says his daughter told him how they were constantly watched over by armed men, \"playing all the time with their guns and their hand grenades\".",
      "He says the male captors treated the women with \"big disrespect\", including forcing them to clean and prepare food.",
      "\"That was really bothering her. She's a girl that if she has something to say, she'll say it. She's not shy. And sometimes she told them what she was thinking about them and their behaviour,\" he says.",
      "He adds that in a small act of resistance, Agam had refused to perform any jobs on the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest. The men detaining her accepted this.",
      "They were also not allowed to speak loudly.",
      "\"When Agam came [back to Israel] she wanted to speak all the time... After a day, she had no voice because she'd spoken so much,\" Mr Berger says.",

      "Elderly hostage in Gaza was killed in 7 October attack, Israel says",
      "Stories of the hostages taken by Hamas from Israel",
      "Yoni Levy, whose daughter Naama, 20, was also taken from the army base, says she was sometimes held in locations where there was a TV or radio playing.",
      "Once, Naama saw her father talking on TV. \"It gave her a lot of hope and optimism... that nobody would forget her, and we'll do whatever is needed to take her out of this hell.\"",
      "He says for Naama, the Hamas attack on the army base was \"much more traumatic than the captivity itself\".",
      "\"It may change but at this stage we think that this is the most tragic day that she's talked about,\" Mr Levy says.",
      "Footage of Naama that day shows her and other female soldiers in bloodstained clothing surrounded by armed men in a room at the base before being forced into a vehicle and taken to Gaza.",
      "The three female soldiers whose parents spoke to the BBC are among five from an all-women unarmed military unit at Nahal Oz freed in the first round of the ceasefire.",
      "Members of the unit, known in Hebrew as Tatzpitaniyot, are tasked with observing the Gaza border and looking for signs of anything suspicious. Survivors and relatives of some of those killed that day say that they had been warning for months that Hamas had been preparing for an attack.",
      "A few days before the 7 October attack, Daniella had been at home on a break from service. She had told her mother then: \"Mummy, when I go back to the army, there's going to be a war.\"",
      "\"I didn't think it was going to be such a war and of course that my daughter would be taken hostage,\" Ms Gilboa says.",
      "Ms Gilboa and the families of the two other observers who spoke to the BBC say they are joining calls for an inquiry into what happened.",
      "They say their daughters remain concerned about the conditions of those still in Gaza and have called for the ceasefire to continue.",
      "Meanwhile, Ms Leshem Gonen says she is still learning what happened to her daughter Romi.",
      "She was shot at the Nova music festival and her mother says she was not properly treated, leaving her with \"an open wound where she could see the bone\".",
      "\"This is something we can know and that she speaks about. The other things, I think it will take time.\"",
      "Ms Leshem Gonen says Romi described her release in the first week of the truce as \"intimidating\" and \"frightening\". She was surrounded by gunmen and crowds. But the moment of their reunion was \"so powerful\".",
      "The parents also described how their daughters had found ways to get through each day in captivity - through drawing, making notes or sharing stories with each other.",
      "\"They wrote as much as they could, every day - what was happening, where were they moving, who were the guards and things like that,\" says Mr Berger.",
      "While in captivity, the young women had dreamt about the things they wanted to do when they got home: getting a haircut and eating sushi.",
      "Daniella had drawn a butterfly with the word \"freedom\" while in captivity - she now has that tattooed on her arm.",
      "They are adapting to life back in Israel, and their families say they are taking the recovery step by step.",
      "The moment of reunion with his daughter Naama is still a blur, says Mr Levy, but he remembers the emotion.",
      "\"The feeling was that... I will take care of you now, and everything's going to be OK. Daddy's here. That's all. And then everything was quiet.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 18:20:48 GMT",
    "summary": "Many world leaders, including Ukraine's President Zelensky, are finding the world is more uncertain under new US leadership.",
    "story": [
      "America is under new management. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is joining a growing list of US allies who are finding that the world according to Donald Trump is a colder, more uncertain and potentially more dangerous place for them.",
      "It must have been bad enough for Zelensky to hear Trump's abrupt announcement that he had welcomed Russia's President Vladimir Putin back to international diplomacy with a 90-minute phone call, to be followed by a face-to-face meeting, perhaps in Saudi Arabia.",
      "After Putin, the White House dialled up Zelensky's number. Speaking to journalists in Ukraine the morning after, Zelensky accepted the fact that Putin received the first call, \"although to be honest, it's not very pleasant\".",
      "What stung Zelensky more was that Trump, who rang him after he spoke to Putin, seemed to regard him, at best, as a junior adjunct to any peace talks. One of Zelensky's many nightmares must be the prospect of Trump and Putin attempting to settle Ukraine's future without anyone else in the negotiation.",
      "He told the journalists that Ukraine \"will not be able to accept any agreements\" made without its involvement.",
      "It was vital, he said, that \"everything does not go according to Putin's plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral\".",
      "Follow the latest updates from the Munich Security Conference",
      "Follow the latest updates from the Munich Security Conference",
      "President Zelensky is heading to the Munich security conference, starting on Friday, where he will attempt to rally Ukraine's allies. He faces a tough meeting with Trump's vice president, JD Vance, who was one of the sternest critics of Joe Biden's aid to Ukraine.",
      "The argument Zelensky will hear from the Americans is that Ukraine is losing and it needs to get real about what happens next. He will argue that Ukraine can win - with the right backing.",
      "The European Union is worried too. After meeting and praising the Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov, the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas posted that Europe must have a central role in any negotiation. \"Our priority now must be strengthening Ukraine and providing robust security guarantees,\" Kallas said.",
      "Zelensky is painfully aware that while his European allies are sounding much more steadfast than the Americans, the US remains the world's strongest military power. He told the Guardian last week that \"security guarantees without America are not real security guarantees\".",
      "Collectively, European allies have given Ukraine more money than the US. But the Americans have weapons and air defence systems - like the Patriot missile batteries that protect Kyiv - that Europeans simply cannot provide.",
      "Putin will be delighted that he is getting a much easier ride than he had from Biden. The former US president called Putin, among other things, a \"pure thug\", a \"brutal tyrant\" and a \"murderous dictator\" and cut off contact after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Just to drive home the point that everything had changed, Trump followed up yesterday's positive assessment of his talk with Putin with an upbeat early morning post on his platform, Truth Social, reflecting on \"great talks with Russia and Ukraine yesterday\". There was now a \"good possibility of ending that horrible, very bloody war!!!\"",
      "Putin is not just back in conversation with the most powerful country in the world. With Trump, he may now see himself as the arbiter of the endgame in the war he started when he broke international law with the all-out invasion of Ukraine almost exactly three years ago.",
      "At the White House, Trump seemed to suggest that the huge numbers of dead and wounded in the Russian military gave some kind of legitimacy to Putin's demand to keep the land captured and annexed by Russia.",
      "\"They took a lot of land and they fought for that land,\" Trump said. As for Ukraine, \"some of it will come back\".",
      "His defence secretary Pete Hegseth's remarks at a Nato meeting in Brussels were more direct. He wanted Ukraine to be \"sovereign and prosperous\". But \"we must start by recognising that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective\".",
      "\"Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering.\"",
      "Trump is still at the easy end of what could become an impossibly tough diplomatic challenge. Boasting that he has the key to ending the Russo-Ukraine war is one thing. Making that happen is something else.",
      "His declaration before any talks with Russia start that Ukraine will not join Nato nor get back all its occupied land has been widely criticised as a poor start by a man who claims to be the world's best dealmaker.",
      "The veteran Swedish diplomat and politician Carl Bildt posted an ironic rebuke on X.",
      "\"It's certainly an innovative approach to a negotiation to make very major concessions even before they have started. Not even Chamberlain went that low in 1938. That Munich ended very bad anyhow.\"",
      "Bildt posted a photo of Britain's then prime minister Neville Chamberlain on his return from Munich in 1938, waving the notorious and worthless agreement he had made with Adolf Hitler - the price of which was the capitulation and break-up of Czechoslovakia and a faster slide towards a second world war.",
      "After the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Vladimir Putin was widely portrayed in the west as the new threat to European peace. Trump's approach to him is very different.",
      "He will have to try to bridge the gap between Putin and Zelensky's positions, which are polar opposites.",
      "Zelensky's declared objective is to regain Ukraine's lost territory, which amounts to around a fifth of its total land mass. He also wants Ukraine to become a full member of Nato.",
      "Putin insists that any peace deal would require Ukraine to give up the land Russia has captured, as well as areas it has not occupied, including the city of Zaporizhzhia which has a population of more than half a million. Ukraine would also become neutral, demilitarised and would never join Nato.",
      "Ukraine's demands will not be acceptable to Moscow, and Trump has indicated he doesn't like them either.",
      "But Russia's amount to an ultimatum, not a serious peace proposal. Trump, once a developer, likes deals that involve tangible real estate. But Putin wants more than land. He wants Ukraine to go back to the relationship it had with the Kremlin during the days when it was part of the Soviet Union. For that to happen, Ukraine would have to lose its independence and sovereignty.",
      "Biden offered Ukraine enough not to lose, because he took Putin's threats to use nuclear weapons if Nato intervened seriously. Trump must be aware of nuclear danger, but he also believes backing Ukraine indefinitely is a bad deal for the US, and he can do better.",
      "As for the Europeans, he might force them to face up to the gross disparity between their military promises to Ukraine and their military capabilities. Only Poland and the Baltic states are backing their public statements about the threat from Russia with qualitatively increased defence spending.",
      "With Russia grinding forward on the battlefields of eastern Ukraine, this is the toughest moment Zelensky will have faced since the dark and desperate first months of the war, when Ukraine fought off Russia's attack on Kyiv.",
      "It is also a moment of decision for his western allies. They face tough choices that cannot be put off much longer.",
      "Europe caught out by Trump's Russia move",

    "summary": "The BBC's Frank Gardner says Nato's unity is badly dented with decisions over Ukraine set to be discussed in Munich.",
    "story": [
      "The US Vice President, JD Vance, Ukraine's President Zelensky and up to 60 other world leaders and decision-makers are due to convene in Munich over the next three days for the annual Munich Security Conference (MSC).",
      "For nearly two decades now I have been attending and covering this event for the BBC and I cannot think of a year when there has been so much at stake in terms of global security. A senior and highly experienced Western official said this week \"this is the most dangerous and contested time I have ever known in my career\".",
      "Why?",
      "Put simply, the current world security order \u2013 the catchily named International Rules-based Order \u2013 is in danger of crumbling. Some would argue this is already happening.",
      "Follow the latest updates from the Munich Security Conference",
      "Follow the latest updates from the Munich Security Conference",
      "The end of consensus",
      "When President Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine three years ago it was widely condemned by much \u2013 although not all \u2013 of the world. Nato, the EU and the West in general reached an extraordinary level of unity in coming together to help Ukraine defend itself, without getting drawn into direct conflict with Russia.",
      "Barring some demurring from Slovakia and Hungary, there was a general consensus that Putin's invasion must be seen to fail or Nato itself would be critically weakened while Russia would eventually be tempted to invade another neighbouring country, such as Estonia. It was often said that Ukraine should be given whatever it took and for as long as it took in order to secure a lasting peace from a position of strength.",
      "Not any more.",
      "President Trump has effectively pulled the rug out from Ukraine's negotiating position by conceding, via his Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, that restoring Ukraine's territory to where it was before the first Russian invasion in 2014 is simply \"not realistic\".",
      "The US has also dashed Kyiv's hopes of joining Nato, a key ambition of President Zelensky, and ruled out sending US troops to help protect its borders from the next time Russia decides to invade.",
      "An even greater shock has come with the news that President Trump held an apparently cordial 90-minute phone call with President Putin, thus abruptly ending the West's three-year freeze in talking to the Russian leader that has been in place since the time of the invasion.",
      "Over the next 72 hours we will be hearing in Munich from President Trump's team here in Munich what the details of their plan for Ukraine will be. Some of it is still to be worked out after his envoy, retired US Army General Keith Kellogg, travels to Kyiv next week.",
      "But for now, Nato's unity is badly dented as clearly there is a wide difference of opinion over Ukraine between Washington and Europe. One wants the war to end as quickly as possible, even if it means conceding to many of Moscow's demands.",
      "The other still believed, at least until this week, that with Russia losing around a thousand battlefield casualties a day and its economy facing dire long-term problems the best way to win a lasting peace would be to keep up the pressure on Moscow until its army was exhausted and it agreed to peace terms more favourable to Ukraine.",
      "That won't be happening now.",
      "Worrying cracks in Nato",
      "For the Nato alliance, now in its 76th year, there are other worrying cracks starting to appear which will also come in for discussion here at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "Last month President Trump announced he wanted to \"buy\" Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark. When Denmark's Prime Minister Frederiksen assured her population that \"Greenland is not for sale\" there followed what was called a \"horrendous\" phone call from Donald Trump who has not ruled out the use of force to take Greenland.",
      "The idea of one Nato country threatening to seize part of another Nato country's territory would have been unthinkable up until now. In Greenland's case there is no justification for it on security grounds since there are more US troops on Greenland than Danish and Copenhagen is happy to agree ways to boost mutual defence for the island.",
      "But even if nothing ever comes of this idea, and most of Scandinavia is dearly hoping that is the case, in some respects the damage has already been done. The message has gone out from the leader of the free world that it's OK to threaten your neighbours by force if you want their territory.",
      "\"It may be,\" says Lord Kim Darroch, the former UK national security adviser and British Ambassador to Washington, \"that Trump's threat of economic measures against Nato ally Denmark, and his refusal to rule out military action against them, are just negotiating tactics. But even if nothing comes from it, it's done great damage. It's another signal of Trump's disdain for Nato. And it will be interpreted in Moscow and Beijing as a message that they have a free hand in Ukraine and Taiwan respectively\".",
      "Washington's European allies will be looking for some reassurance here in Munich that that is not the case. But President Trump is already well on the way to reshaping America's role in the world and the indications are he is unlikely to be listening to any complaints coming from Europe.",

      "Ever since January, when the breakout Chinese AI app launched, the 28-year-old has brought her dilemmas and sorrows, including the recent death of her grandmother, to the chatbot. Its responses have resonated so deeply they have at times brought her to tears.",
      "\"DeepSeek has been such an amazing counsellor. It has helped me look at things from different perspectives and does a better job than the paid counselling services I have tried,\" says Holly, who asked for her real name to be withheld to protect her privacy.",
      "From writing reports and Excel formulas to planning trips, workouts and learning new skills, AI apps have found their way into many people's lives across the world.",
      "In China, though, young people like Holly have been looking to AI for something not typically expected of computing and algorithms - emotional support.",
      "While the success of DeepSeek has inspired national pride, it also appears to have become a source of comfort for young Chinese like Holly, some of whom are increasingly disillusioned about their future.",
      "Experts say the sluggish economy, high unemployment and Covid lockdowns have all played a role in this sentiment, while the Communist Party's tightening grip has also shrunk outlets for people to vent their frustrations.",
      "DeepSeek: The Chinese AI app that has the world talking",
      "DeepSeek: How China's 'AI heroes' overcame US curbs to stun Silicon Valley",
      "DeepSeek is a generative AI tool - similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini - trained on massive amounts of information to recognise patterns. This allows it to predict things like people's shopping habits, create new content in text and images, and also carry on conversations like a person.",
      "The chatbot has struck a chord in China partly because it is far better than other homegrown AI apps, but also because it offers something unique: its AI model, R1, lets users see its \"thought process\" before delivering a response.",
      "DeepSeek, my friend",
      "The first time she used DeepSeek, Holly asked it to write a tribute to her late grandmother.",
      "The app took all of five seconds to come up with a response, and it was so beautifully composed, it stunned her.",
      "Holly, who lives in Guangzhou, responded: \"You write so well, it makes me feel lost. I feel I'm in an existential crisis.\"",

      "\"I am but the occasional valley you've passed through, that allows you to hear the weight of your own voice.\"",
      "Reflecting on this exchange on Chinese social media app RedNote, Holly tells the BBC: \"I don't know why I teared up reading this. Perhaps because it's been a long, long time since I received such comfort in real life.",
      "\"I have been so weighed down by distant dreams and the endlessness of work that I have long forgotten my own voice and soul. Thank you, AI.\"",
      "Rival apps from the West like ChatGPT and Gemini are blocked in China as part of broader restrictions on foreign media and apps. To access them, users in China have to pay for Virtual Private Network (VPN) services.",
      "Homegrown alternatives, including models developed by tech giants Alibaba, Baidu and ByteDance paled in comparison - that is, until DeepSeek came along.",
      "Holly, who works in the creative industry, rarely uses the other Chinese AI apps, \"as they are not that great\".",

      "The demand for mental health services has grown across the world but they remain stigmatised in parts of Asia, experts say.",
      "Another woman tells the BBC her experience using other Chinese AI apps \"ended in disappointment\" but that she has been \"amazed\" by DeepSeek.",
      "The woman, who lives in Hubei province, had asked the app if she was oversharing her experiences and emotions with family and friends.",
      "\"It was my first time seeking counsel from DeepSeek. When I read its thought process, I felt so moved that I cried,\" the woman wrote on RedNote.",
      "In reasoning through her query, DeepSeek suggested that the woman's self-perception as an over-sharer might stem from a deep desire for approval.",
      "The chatbot gives itself a mental note: \"Response should offer practical advice while being empathetic.\" This could include \"affirming the user's sense of self-awareness\".",
      "Its eventual response not only provided this affirmation, but also offered her a comprehensive step-by-step framework to help her decide if things needed to be changed.",
      "\"DeepSeek has introduced new perspectives that have freed me\u2026 I feel it really tries to understand your question and get to know you as a person, before offering a response,\" she says.",

      "At least four jurisdictions have now introduced restrictions on DeepSeek, or are considering doing so. South Korea has blocked access to it for military purposes, while Taiwan and Australia have banned it from all government devices.",

      "In the US, two lawmakers are asking for the Chinese app to be banned from government devices.",
      "And then there is the tightly controlled online space in which it must operate in China.",
      "It is common for social media companies in the country to remove content that is perceived to be threatening to \"social stability\" or overly critical of the Communist Party.",
      "As is the case with other popular apps and social media companies like Weibo or WeChat, politically sensitive topics are banned on DeepSeek.",
      "When the BBC asked DeepSeek if Taiwan was a sovereign nation, the app initially offered a comprehensive response detailing Taipei's and Beijing's different perspectives, acknowledging that this was a \"complex and politically sensitive issue\".",
      "Then it scrubbed all that, declaring: \"Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else.\"",
      "When asked about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre when pro-democracy protests were crushed and 200 civilians killed by the military, according to the Chinese government - other estimates range from hundreds to many thousands - DeepSeek again apologised, saying the topic was \"beyond [its] current scope\".",
      "Several of the DeepSeek users the BBC was initially in touch with stopped responding when asked if the app's self-censorship was a cause for concern - an indication of how sensitive such discussions can be in China.",
      "People have got into trouble with authorities in China because of their online activities.",

      "A proposed law in Colombia's Congress seeks to ban the sale of merchandise that celebrates former drug lord Pablo Escobar, whose cocaine cartel has been linked to thousands of murders.",
      "One day in 1989, Gonzalo Rojas was at school in the Colombian capital of Bogota when a teacher pulled him out of class to deliver some devastating news.",
      "His father, also called Gonzalo, had died in a plane crash that morning.",

      "The blast wasn't an accident. It was a deliberate bomb attack by Pablo Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel.",
      "While an era defined by drug wars, bombings, kidnappings and a sky high murder rate has largely been relegated to Colombia's past, Escobar's legacy has not.",
      "The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos.",
      "In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors.",
      "But a proposed law in Colombia's Congress is seeking to change this.",
      "The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals  - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings.",
      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",
      "Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods.",
      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",
      "Today it's been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar.",
      "\"This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,\" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.",
      "Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%.",
      "If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock.",
      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",
      "Shop assistant Mar\u00eda Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical.",
      "\"We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,\" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items.",
      "Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine.",
      "He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population.",
      "Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment.",
      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.co in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",
      "In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. G\u00f3mez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress.",
      "\"In Germany you don't sell Hitler T-shirts or swastikas. In Italy you don't sell Mussolini stickers, and you don't go to Chile and get a copy of Pinochet's ID card.",
      "\"I think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country - a conversation that hasn't happened yet.\"",
      "Medell\u00edn's mayor  - who was also a presidential candidate in the 2022 elections - has publicly backed the bill, calling the merchandise \"an insult to the city, the country and the victims\".",
      "In El Poblado, an upmarket area of Medell\u00edn popular with tourists, three Americans browse a stall brimming with souvenirs. One buys a cap with Escobar's name and face printed on the front. He says he wants a memento of \"history\".",
      "But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 01:35:51 GMT",
    "summary": "The US president is ratcheting up pressure on South Africa over its domestic and foreign policy.",
    "story": [
      "South Africa appears to be at a crossroads in its waxing and waning relationship with the US following President Donald Trump's controversial decision last week to cut financial aid to the country.",
      "Trump said South Africa was pursuing what he called \"unjust and immoral practices\" against the white minority Afrikaner community and by filing a genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023.",
      "His move has sent shockwaves across South Africa, with experts fearing he may go on to use this opportunity to end preferential access to the US market through its special US-Africa trade programme known as the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa).",
      "The two countries have generally had friendly relations since the end of white-minority rule in 1994 when anti-apartheid icon and Nobel Peace Prize winner Nelson Mandela was elected South Africa's first black president.",
      "Though it took the US another 14 years to remove Mandela from its \"terrorist watch list\" for his role in fighting the racist system of apartheid, which had been introduced by South Africa's then-Afrikaner rulers in1948.",
      "The latest tension flared up a few days after Trump's inauguration last month when South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law the Expropriation Bill, which allows the government to confiscate land without compensation in certain circumstances.",
      "Trump's response came last week when he threatened to cut future funding over what he termed \"terrible things, horrible things\" the country's leadership was doing.",
      "The US president further accused South Africa, without any basis in fact, of \"confiscating land\" and \"doing things that are perhaps far worse than that\".",
      "He doubled down in the face of the South African government's vehement rebuttal and signed an executive order last Friday freezing aid.",
      "This adds up to nearly $440m (\u00a3353m) - the amount of aid reportedly allocated in 2023 - though the US embassy in South Africa has subsequently said that funding from Pepfar, an American programme countering the global spread of HIV, will not be affected, adding the caveat that \"not all Pepfar activities will resume\".",
      "South Africa is one of the biggest beneficiaries of Pepfar, which contributes about 17% to its HIV/Aids programme in which around 5.5 million people receive anti-retrovirals.",
      "In his executive order, Trump also accused South Africa of a \"shocking disregard of its citizens' rights\" and taking \"aggressive positions\" against the US and its ally Israel in its ICJ case.",
      "In addition to the aid freeze, Trump offered to help refugees from the Afrikaner community, who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers, to settle in the US.",
      "His stance has played into the hands of conservative Afrikaner lobby groups, including AfriForum and Solidarity, which want the government repeal what it calls \"race-based laws\" such as affirmative action and black economic empowerment.",
      "This chimes with views by Trump's close adviser Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who was born in South Africa. He questioned on X why Ramaphosa had \"openly racist ownership laws\".",
      "This is not the first time South Africa's land reform policy has drawn Trump's ire.",
      "In 2018, during his first presidency, he accused South African authorities of the \"large-scale killing of farmers\" and asked his then secretary of state to look into the matter of the government \"seizing land from white farmers\".",
      "While Trump's remarks sparked a backlash at the time, Dr Oscar van Heerden, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg, told the BBC there had \"never been this kind of radical action taken to the point of an executive order being signed\".",
      "With their relationship now in a precarious state - both countries are weighing up their next move.",
      "On the trade front, Donald MacKay, CEO of Johannesburg-based trade consulting firm XA Global Trade Advisors, said that while the US was one of South Africa's biggest partners, it was not its \"closest trading partner\".",
      "South Africa exports a variety of minerals to the US, including platinum, iron and manganese.",
      "It also one of the largest exporters under Agoa, generating about $2.7bn in revenue in 2023, mostly from the sale of vehicles, jewellery and metals.",
      "\"Over the years, that relationship has waxed and waned. It's never been terribly strong [since white-minority rule ended in South Africa]. But at the same time, I think it also never deteriorated quite as much as it has in recent years and I don't think it's South Africa's fault,\" Mr MacKay told the BBC.",
      "But he admitted South Africa had done \"a lot\" in recent years to irritate the US.",
      "\"Those irritations get to accumulate and under President Trump\u2026 this is seen as an opportunity to put South Africa in its place.\"",
      "Dr Van Heerden put the change in dynamics partly down to \"global shifts\" and \"new competition driving up against the US\" from the likes of China, India and Brazil.",
      "While experts spoke on the benefits of Agoa, which is coming up for review later this year, they agreed that the impact might not be as significant as some fear.",
      "Agoa was introduced in 2000 and it gives eligible sub-Saharan African countries duty-free access to the US for more than 1,800 products.",
      "Mr MacKay said he would be surprised if South Africa continued benefiting from this preferential agreement after the review.",
      "\"My instinct is, whatever the reason that Trump is upset with South Africa, at the moment Agoa would be the easiest mechanism to use to punish South Africa.\"",
      "Dr Van Heerden added that even if agreement was not renewed, or South Africa ended up being excluded, those businesses currently benefiting from it would suffer short-term losses but would manage to bounce back in a few years.",
      "He said at the moment President Ramaphosa's government was opting for the diplomatic route - though the Trump administration's seeming lack of interest in diplomacy drastically reduced chances of success.",
      "This has probably not been helped by South Africa's Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola blunt response on Wednesday to Trump's move, saying there was \"no chance\" that South Africa would withdraw its case against Israel at the ICJ.",
      "\"Standing by our principles sometimes has consequences, but we remain firm that this is important for the world, and the rule of law,\" Lamola told the Financial Times.",
      "South Africa has accused Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians living in Gaza, an allegation Israel denies.",
      "Meanwhile, Ramaphosa, in his capacity as G20 president, has announced he will be sending a delegation around the world to clarify South Africa's domestic and foreign policies - with Washington being a key stop.",
      "South Africa assumed the presidency of the G20, a cohort of countries that meet to discuss global economic and political issues, in December last year, seeing it as an opportunity to bolster its international standing.",
      "But in a snub to South Africa, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced that he will not attend a G20 meeting of foreign ministers taking place next week in Johannesburg.",
      "\"My job is to advance America's national interests, not waste taxpayer money or coddle anti-Americanism,\" he said.",
      "South Africa is part of Brics, and alliance of major developing countries including Brazil, Russia, India and China, that is attempting to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier nations of North America and Western Europe.",
      "Mr MacKay believes it will be difficult for South Africa and other nations to navigate relations with the US under \"the most unpredictable politician in the world\", suggesting that they will have to increasingly see Brics as an alternative partner.",
      "But significantly for South Africa, the European Union (EU), one of its largest trading partners, has reaffirmed its support for the country.",
      "Ant\u00f3nio Costa, president of the European Council - which sets the general political direction and priorities of the EU - posted on X on Monday that he had spoken to Ramaphosa by phone to highlight the \"EU's commitment to deepen ties with South Africa\".",
      "Should South Africa's charm offensive fail, Mr Van Heerden suggests the government could opt to \"negotiate hard\" and use the minerals it supplies to the US as a \"bargaining chip\".",
      "But he voices a warning: \"South Africa is going to have to think very carefully about how they play this chess game [where] the opening gambit has already been made by President Trump and Elon Musk.\"",

    "title": "Why India fails to protect its domestic workers despite decades of abuse",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 22:18:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Despite the high demand for domestic workers, they remain India's most vulnerable and exploited people.",
    "story": [
      "Smitha (not her real name), a domestic helper in Delhi for 28 years, can't forget the day she was beaten in public by one of her employers.",
      "The woman had accused Smitha - a Dalit woman from the most discriminated against caste in Hinduism's entrenched social hierarchy - of stealing her daughter's earrings and then refused to pay her.",
      "\"After many requests, I confronted her in public. That's when she started abusing and hitting me. I held her hands to stop the abuse but the guards came and dragged me out of the housing society and locked the gate,\" Smitha says.",
      "She was eventually paid \u2013 a measly 1,000 rupees [$11; \u00a39] for a month of sweeping, mopping and washing dishes \u2013 after a more sympathetic family intervened on her behalf. But she was banned from entering the housing community and did not bother going to the police as she believed they would not take action.",
      "Smitha's story is one among hundreds of thousands of accounts of mistreatment, abuse and sexual assault reported by India's domestic workers. Most are women and many are migrants within the country, belonging to castes that are looked down upon.",
      "Last month, India's Supreme Court raised concerns over their exploitation and asked the federal government to look into creating a law to protect them from abuse.",
      "But this isn't the first time that an attempt has been made to create such a legal framework. Despite years of advocacy by various groups and federal ministries, no such law has ever been passed.",
      "Separate bills proposed in 2008 and 2016, aimed at registering domestic workers and improving their working conditions, have not yet been passed. A national policy drafted in 2019 aimed at including domestic workers under existing labour laws has not been implemented.",
      "Sonia George of the Self Employed Women's Association (Sewa), who was part of the task force that formulated the draft policy, calls it one of the \"most comprehensive policies for domestic workers\" yet, but says that successive governments have failed to implement it.",
      "As a result, India's vast army of domestic helpers must rely on employer goodwill for basics such as wages or leave or even a baseline of respect. According to official statistics, India has 4.75 million domestic workers, including three million women. But the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates the true numbers to be between 20 and 80 million.",
      "\"We have a patronising relationship with the help and not a labour employment relationship,\" says Professor Neetha N from the Centre for Women's Development Studies.",
      "\"This maintains the status quo and is one of the biggest hurdles to regulating and legalising domestic work.\"",
      "As things stand, private homes are not considered to be an establishment or workplace, so domestic work falls outside the purview of social protections such as minimum wages, the right to safe working conditions, the right to unionise and access to social security schemes.",
      "At least 14 Indian states, including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, have mandated minimum wages for domestic workers and some federal laws, like India's anti-sexual harassment and child labour laws, include domestic workers in their scope.",
      "But there is very little awareness among domestic workers that they can take advantage of these provisions, Ms George says, adding that the nature of the profession also poses challenges.",
      "Workers are scattered and there is no mechanism to register or even identify them as they generally don't sign any kind of contract with their employers.",
      "\"We will need to set up systems to register domestic workers - getting over their 'invisibility' is a big step towards regularising the profession,\" she says.",
      "That applies to employers too. \"They are completely invisible in the system and hence escape accountability and responsibility,\" Ms George says.",
      "The caste system also poses further complexities - workers from some castes may agree to clean toilets in a home while others from slightly different castes may not.",
      "Ultimately the whole concept of domestic work should be redefined, Ms George says. \"Domestic work is considered to be unskilled work but that is not the case in reality. You cannot care for a sick person or cook a meal without being skilled,\" she adds.",
      "In addition to failing to pass its own laws or implement its own policy, India has also not yet ratified ILO's Convention 189 \u2013 a landmark international agreement that aims to ensure that domestic workers have the same rights and protections as other workers. Despite voting in favour of the convention in 2011, India does not yet conform to all its provisions.",
      "India has a \"moral obligation\" to conform to the ILO convention, Ms George says. She adds that having a law will also help regulate private recruitment agencies and prevent the exploitation of domestic workers who go abroad to work.",
      "Last year, the wealthy Hinduja family made headlines after a Swiss court found them guilty of exploiting their domestic workers. The family was accused of trafficking vulnerable Indians to Switzerland and forcing them to work in their mansion for excruciatingly long hours without proper pay. The family's lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict.",
      "Perhaps the simplest explanation for decades of inaction in the face of a tide of abuses lies in the conflict of interest such regulation poses for India's decision makers, Ms George suggests.",
      "\"At the end of the day, the people at the table who have the power to sign off on a bill or a law are also employers of domestic workers and the ones who benefit from the status quo,\" she says. \"So, for any real change in the system, we first need a change in our mindset.\"",

      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "title": "Legal showdown looms as Trump tests limits of presidential power",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:00:29 GMT",
    "summary": "A judge accused the Trump administration of defying his orders, setting up a battle that could end up at the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "In the first weeks of his second term, President Donald Trump has wasted no time in flexing his political muscle. That much is clear.",
      "Since taking office in January, he has ordered the suspension of all new asylum claims, cancelled refugee resettlement, frozen government hiring and spending, gutted agencies established by Congress, moved to ban gender transition care for teenagers and offered a buyout deal for hundreds of thousands of federal workers.",
      "The whirlwind of unilateral action on his campaign promises has pushed the limits of presidential power \u2013 and prompted legal challenges from Democrats, unions and legal groups.",
      "So far the federal courts have been the only substantive roadblocks to Trump's agenda, as judges have temporarily suspended some of his most contentious actions, including a bid to end automatic citizenship for anyone born on US soil - a right established from the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.",
      "But Trump is pressing on - and seems headed for a showdown with the judiciary that could eventually end in the highest court in the land. This week, a Rhode Island judge said the Trump administration was clearly and openly defying his court order to unfreeze billions in federal funds. The White House responded by saying that \"every action\" the president took was \"completely lawful\".",
      "Vance questions authority of US judges to challenge Trump",
      "Judge blocks Trump plan to put thousands of USAID staff on leave",
      "Judge blocks Trump's bid to restrict birthright citizenship",
      "If Trump's orders do reach the US Supreme Court, six of the nine justices there - including three appointed by Trump in his first term - are conservative. Just last term, the court issued a decision holding Trump, and all future presidents, largely immune from prosecution for official actions while in office.",
      "At the time, it was a landmark expansion of presidential authority. But some observers have suggested that Trump's latest moves could be part of a strategy to expand his powers even further.",
      "Trump's move to freeze hundreds of billions of dollars in federal grants and dismantle the United States Agency for International Aid (USAID) could run afoul of the checks-and-balances system of US government.",
      "Congress, rather than the White House, holds the authority to control federal spending and taxation - what's known as \"the power of the purse\". Legislators also established USAID and lawsuits have been filed arguing that Trump has no legal authority to dismantle it and refuse to spend funds allocated by Congress.",
      "But if the high courts agree to uphold some of his sweeping executive actions, it could strengthen his ability to transform the government and enact policy changes without the help of Congress.",
      "And even if the courts rule against the president, says Ilya Shapiro, a constitutional expert at the Manhattan Institute, those legal defeats might be politically advantageous.",
      "\"There could be political benefits to being challenged in court and then even losing in court because then you can run against judges and make political hay of it.\"",
      "There is another scenario, however. Trump could simply refuse to comply with any court that tries to stop his exercise of unfettered presidential power.",
      "In Oval Office comments on Tuesday, the president hinted that this might be an option, in his typically oblique way.",
      "\"We want to weed out the corruption,\" Trump said. \"And it seems hard to believe that a judge could say we don't want you to do that.\"",
      "\"Maybe we have to look at the judges,\" he continued. \"I think it's a very serious violation.\"",
      "On Sunday, Trump's vice-president, JD Vance, was even more blunt.",
      "\"Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,\" he posted on the social media site X. That view was similar to one Vance expressed in a 2021 podcast, when he said that if Trump returned to power he should refuse to comply with any court order that prevented him from firing federal workers.",
      "Directly defying a court ruling, however, would cut against centuries of US history and amount to the opening skirmishes in a constitutional crisis that pits the president against the branch of government designed to establish and interpret the law of the land.",
      "\"My read is that President Trump is testing the outer boundaries of what he might be able to get away with, doing a lot of things that are blatantly against the law and maybe some things that are closer to the line,\" said Fred Smith, a professor at the Emory University School of Law.",
      "\"They are breaking a lot of norms,\" Mr Smith added of the nascent Trump administration. \"Why he is doing that, only he knows fully. But he is doing it.\"",
      "So far, Trump and his allies have made aggressive comments about unfavourable court decisions in the public and in legal filings, but have yet to be sanctioned for disobeying a court. When Trump was the target of multiple prosecutions over the past four years, he frequently questioned the legitimacy of the presiding judges, but his courtroom lawyers adhered to the law and legal procedures.",
      "The federal judge in Rhode Island, who had placed a temporary hold on another Trump order to freeze some federal spending, did warn in court filings Monday that the administration was violating his temporary restraining order but stopped short of finding them in contempt.",
      "Conservative legal scholar Ed Whelan wrote on X that it would be \"extremely grave\" for the Trump administration to defy a federal court order.",
      "\"I'm open to the argument that truly extraordinary circumstances (the makings of a wild hypothetical) might justify defiance,\" Mr Whelan wrote. \"But in our constitutional system there should be an overwhelming presumption in favour of executive-branch compliance with federal court orders.\"",
      "Should Trump disobey, and therefore delegitimise, the courts, the decision could come back to bite him when the time comes for the president to see his own lawful agenda enforced, some legal experts say. Democratic states like California, for instance, might be inclined to ignore White House directives and federal laws they don't like - and Trump would be hard pressed to use the courts to bring them to heel.",
      "\"If the executive decides it will obey some court orders but not others, it will find it won't get any court orders that it wishes to obey,\" said Philip Bobbitt, a constitutional scholar at Columbia University Law School. \"I just don't think they thought that through.\"",
      "When Donald Trump redecorated the Oval Office to his liking in January, he reinstalled a portrait of President Andrew Jackson that had hung on the wall across from the Resolute Desk in his first term.",
      "The seventh US president is remembered for a critical moment of defiance against the United States Supreme Court. When the justices decided a dispute between the state of Georgia and Cherokee Indian governments in 1832, Jackson did not seem interested in following its direction.",
      "Jackson allegedly said of the Chief Justice's ruling, \"John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it!\"",
      "Nearly 200 years later, Trump himself has found himself on his own collision course with America's judiciary."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:31:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's plans for tariffs risk raising prices for items from cars to canned food.",
    "story": [
      "A 25% tax is set to be imposed on all imports of steel and aluminium into the US , ending exemptions from the rules for goods from major trade partners including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, as well as the European Union.",
      "The expanded tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump, expected to go into effect next month, will mean many US businesses wanting to bring the metals into the country will have to pay more.",
      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",
      "Since then, steel manufacturers have cut production further, pushing up prices, warned the CMI, which sent a letter to the Trump administration earlier this month signed by big food companies including General Mills, Del Monte and Goya.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the CMI, said without exemptions for can manufacturers to import steel tariff free, grocery prices for canned foods made in the US are likely to rise.",
      "\"While the president may believe that these tariffs are protecting the steel industry, they certainly are undermining our food security and our supply resiliency for American canned food, which Americans rely on every day,\" Mr Budway said.",
      "When it comes to aluminium, brewers and makers of fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola, have also warned the move will add costs and could lead to higher prices for customers.",
      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.",
      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",
      "Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility.",
      "But he said it was still \"realistic\" to expect some of the costs from the metals tariffs to trickle down to buyers.",
      "However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.",
      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",
      "TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",
      "The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.",
      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",
      "Companies unable to absorb such costs would likely pass them on through higher prices in the shops."

      "Asked his title, Diones replied , \"I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around.\"",
      "\"An expert on both the people and the magazine?\"",
      "\"That's right.\"",
      "\"You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?\"",
      "\"Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!\" he laughed.",
      "The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting.",
      "One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. \"We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff.\"",
      "The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. \"All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work,\" Diones said.",
      "Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse.",
      "\"At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley,\" said editor David Remnick. \"Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery.\"",
      "Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society.",
      "In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, \"It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did he have against Iowa?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Remnick laughed. \"To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles \u2026\"",
      "The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. \"We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque,\" Remnick said. \"It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking.\"",
      "Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers \u2013 more than two dozen.",
      "So, what is a fact-checker? \"Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be,\" McIntosh said.",
      "\"Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out,\" I said.",
      "\"I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us,\" McIntosh laughed.",
      "And everything gets checked \u2013 not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Mathew, the department's associate director, remembers one cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. \"He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'\" she recalled. \"And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic.\"",
      "\"But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny,\" I said.",
      "\"Not pithy enough, no,\" said Mathew. \"All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'\"",
      "Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.",
      "The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month.",
      "So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, \"It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in.\"",
      "\"Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?\"",
      "\"I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure,\" said Remnick.",
      "\"Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging.\"",
      "These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, \"How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation \u2013 four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine.\"",
      "For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: \"He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers.\"",
      "One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: \"Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them.\"",
      "In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in.",
      "I said, \"maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?\"",
      "\"That's right, and I'm in it now,\" laughed Diones. \"And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it.\"",

And when I got to be in a play, I was so happy. That was a big deal for me.\"",

      "\"Well, I think we're not necessarily told that, you know, dark-skinned Black girls are the prettiest girls,\" Erivo said. \"And the only person that really is telling you, thankfully, is your mother. It's up to you to figure out that for yourself, and to start owning what beauty is to you.\"",

That sort of fractured relationship I have with him, I think, originally was one of the driving forces of, you know, you want to do well because you want to prove that you're good enough to be loved.

    "summary": "Stephanie Courtney (Flo, the Progressive Insurance saleswoman), Dean Winters (Mayhem, of Allstate insurance commercials), and Deanna Colon (the unstoppable dancer in Jardiance diabetes drug ads) talk about their fame as pitch people.",
    "story": [
      "You know those Progressive Insurance commercials? Comedian Stephanie Courtney has played Flo the Insurance Woman in 215 ads, so far. She's helped turn Progressive into America's second-largest insurance company.",
      "She is, by any measure, one of the most successful actors in the world \u2013 on television nonstop for 16 years, with face recognition by the public, and the money that goes with it. \"I'm not gonna fight you on that!\" Courtney laughed. \"Even though in my head I'm like, What?\"",
      "I asked, \"What does it mean when you go out in public? Do people harass you? Want selfies?\"",
      "\"No, not really,\" she said. \"Normally I look like a sea hag. So, I get a double life.\"",
      "She's come a long way since 2007: \"I was broke as a joke. I was auditioning. I was driving around L.A. auditioning for every commercial, every show.\"",
      "Being called a struggling actor, Courtney said, would be a compliment. \"I would've aspired to be a struggling actor!\" she laughed. \"And then, I got the audition for Progressive.\"",
      "That first ad wasn't intended to be funny. But then came the ad-lib that changed advertising history: \"I remember the first actor, his line after I tell him the whole thing is, 'Wow.' And he said, 'Wow.' And I'm like, 'WOW! I know! I say it louder!' I was kind of shocked at how I screamed in this actor's face.",
      "\"And so, that's the first clue about, like, who is she, how crazy can she get,\" she said.",
      "Viewers loved Flo, and a commercial icon was born.",
      "You may know Dean Winters from his roles on \"Oz,\" \"30 Rock,\" or \"John Wick.\" But you're most likely to know him from the 150 TV ads he's made for Allstate. He plays Mayhem, the human embodiment of every risky person, place, or thing in your life. \"It's like, 'Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem!' I can't even ride the subway anymore,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Does it bother you at all that you're getting recognized more for an ad campaign?\"",
      "\"I think in the beginning, maybe a little bit,\" Winters replied. \"But I wouldn't have the lifestyle that I live if it wasn't for people watching the commercials, watching the TV shows and movies, paying for their insurance. So, every time someone stops me, my first thought is, this person is helping me pay my mortgage!\"",
      "The luxury of having a side hustle is not lost on Winters: \"It's a very fickle business,\" he said. \"You can go six months, eight months without working, easily. A lot of my friends are struggling right now. And so, like, I'm very cognizant of how lucky I am. it's become, like, the greatest thing that ever happened to me.\"",
      "But if anyone knows about the ups and downs of showbiz, it's Deanna Colon. \"I am a 360-degree entertainer, singer, songwriter, vocal coach,\" she said. \"If you want to be in the world of entertainment, you have to do it all.\"",
      "Colon was on \"America's Got Talent,\" and she's appeared in ads for Pepsi and Big Lots. But the biggest break she ever got was the Jardiance commercial.",
      "\"I have Type 2 diabetes, but I manage it well, it's a little pill with a big story to tell!\"",
      "\"I'm dancing with my mailman and I'm, 'Hey, how you doing buddy?' And she's living her best life!\" Colon said.",
      "The ad aired in March 2023. And aired, and aired, and aired. \"Apparently they showed it one million times,\" she laughed. \"People were yelling at me online, 'I'm so sick of seeing your face!' And I'm like, 'I have no power in how much they air this thing, guys!'\"",
      "Commercial pay can be pretty good: \"With Big Lots, I made over a hundred thousand dollars in a three-month period,\" she said. \"Plus, you get the health insurance. Yeah, it's awesome.\"",
      "What wasn't so awesome was the online hate that the Jardiance ad brought her.\u00a0 \"I would get emails to my personal website that were horrible, and I'd just be crying,\" Colon said. \"It was mostly about my weight and how, you know, 'Oh, if you danced like that all the time, you wouldn't be the size you are.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you do anything differently now that you know how toxic and horrific some people can be?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"I'm always gonna be a plus-size woman. I'm always gonna be a curvy woman. And you're gonna see me singing and dancing and acting. The joy of it all far outweighs the haters.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Dean Winters will be Mayhem for as long as Allstate will have him. \"You know, I really hope that I'm doing it until Mayhem is wheelchair racing in a nursing home, you know what I mean?\" he laughed.",
      "As for Stephanie Courtney, she's given up her youthful dreams of appearing on Broadway or on \"Saturday Night Live.\" But she still performs every week with The Groundlings improv group.",
      "And she still loves being Flo. \"I will tell you, the thing that made my heart grow three sizes that day was the Halloween costumes, seeing, especially like little kids, I love it so much,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Pugilism has been a favored subject of artists and photographers since boxers first stepped into the ring. \"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\" an exhibit in West Palm Beach, Fla., captures this most combative of sports.",
    "story": [
      "Muhammed Ali is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time. But he also packed a punch with art works, like this 1967 drawing called \"The Crowd,\" seen from his perspective looking out from the ring, with some in the audience smiling, some frowning. \"I love that part where he is acknowledging that not only did he have fans, but he might have had some haters as well,\" said curator Arden Sherman.",
      "Four of Ali's works are prominently featured in \u00a0\"Strike Fast, Dance Lightly: Artists on Boxing,\"\u00a0at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida. It's an exhibition devoted to boxing \u2013 winners, losers, and everything in-between.",
      "Sherman says the show explores a host of different aspects about this most accessible of sports: \"It's rare to encounter a human of a certain age on this planet that doesn't have an understanding of the sport of boxing,\" she said.",
      "Artists do seem to gravitate toward boxing. There are more than 100 works on display here \u2013 paintings, photographs and sculptures \u2013 including many by and about women. One work by Zoe Buchman features frilly fabrics on boxing gloves. Sherman said. \"She's someone who is consistently standing up for female rights and female empowerment.\"",
      "Sherman says the exhibit comes at a very auspicious time: \"I believe, as humans, we find ourselves fighting for something or defending another thing. It is a contentious moment we live in, and what better way to express that but through the symbolism granted to us through the sport of boxing.\"",
      "So, the give-and-take in works like this, by George Bellows, perhaps America's best-known painter of boxing, seems to take on new meaning.",
      "This 1923 work, called \"Introducing John L. Sullivan,\" depicts not just a famous boxer and the announcer, but also the promoters, money makers, and wheeler-dealers behind all of it.",
      "The exhibit features some heavyweight artists: There's Roy Lichtenstein's \"Sweet Dreams Baby!\" from 1965, and Keith Haring's late 1980s painted steel sculpture.",
      "Sherman says the artists are \"thinking about love, violence, fantasy, death. \u2026 I think the artists are thinking about being alive. I think they are thinking about their own identity, and how they navigate that in this world.\"",
      "Among the most recent works is a pair of paintings from 2023 by Jared McGriff. \"One of the things about boxing and this act of being in a battle is that it can be disorienting,\" he said. \"The thing that I think about with these two works is this idea of internal struggle and the idea of what it takes from an internal determination and focus standpoint to reach this level of athleticism.\"",
      "There are also flashes of humor, such as Michael Halsband's 1985 photo of artists Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat in boxing gear:",
      "... or Harry Benson's famous shot of a very young Muhammad Ali meeting the very young Beatles in a Miami gym on their first trip to the U.S., in 1964:",
      "Sherman said, \"Who would have thought that these five would be inside of this ring together, and this would become this iconic image of boxing and fame?\"",

    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 16:14:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Pertussis cases are on the rise again, after a dip following the winter holidays.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. confirmed at least a dozen deaths from whooping cough last year, according to preliminary figures released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That marks the most fatalities from the bacterial infection since a 2017 surge of the illness, which is also known as pertussis.",
      "Over the last month, pertussis infections have been rising again. While cases reported to the CDC by health departments dipped over the winter holidays, weekly infections have accelerated for a month straight since then.",
      "At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before.",
      "Weekly cases peaked at 577 late last year, before plummeting to less than 200 over the New Year's holiday.",
      "Florida reported 44 cases last week, the most of any state. That displaces Ohio, which had been the state with the most pertussis infections for many recent weeks.",
      "Cases have been reported in counties throughout Florida, according to data from the state's health department, with the largest tallies around Miami and Tampa.",
      "Similar to other states, most cases reported in Florida have been in children under 5 years old. More than a third of whooping cough cases have been in older kids.",
      "\"People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.",
      "Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks.",
      "Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines.",
      "Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed.",
      "A local health department earlier this month in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks.",
      "The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had \"other health factors that contributed\" to their death.",
      "\"This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,\" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.",
      "Officials have warned for months that the U.S. was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every three to five years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.",
      "\"We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,\" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami.",
      "He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to \"little pockets of increases\" around their system.",
      "Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk.",
      "\"They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,\" said Mestre.",
      "Caregivers are urged to get up to date on their vaccines because that can reduce the risk of passing on an infection to young children, Mestre said. Pregnant moms who get vaccinated also pass on immunity to their children, protecting them as soon as they are born.",
      "\"It's important that people understand that immunity wanes, even if you are vaccinated as a child. And if you are going to be around infants, we recommend vaccination every 10 years,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the National Institutes of Health from implementing steep cuts to how medical research grants are funded, after 22 states sued to stop the change.",
      "The ruling by District Judge Angel Kelley, who was nominated by President Biden in 2021, halts the policy pending further court arguments from states and the Trump administration. A hearing is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 21.",
      "\"We will not allow the Trump Administration to unlawfully undermine our economy, hamstring our competitiveness, or play politics with our public health,\" had said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement announcing the lawsuit.",
      "The pause is limited to research institutions in the states\u00a0that joined the lawsuit. Those include California, New York and North Carolina, which together with Massachusetts rank among the top five recipients of NIH grant funding\u00a0by state.",
      "Hospitals and universities criticized the move, first announced Friday by the Trump administration, which the National Institutes of Health said would save the federal government more than $4 billion a year.",
      "As outlined in an NIH memo, it would cap the amount of funding for what are called \"indirect costs,\" for general expenses like facilities and administration, at 15%, down from an average of around 27 to 28%.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's pick to head the department that oversees the NIH, may undo the cuts, according to Sen. Susan Collins. The Senate is expected to vote by Thursday on whether to confirm Kennedy, after his nomination cleared the Senate's finance committee\u00a0last week.",
      "\"He has promised that as soon as he is confirmed, he will re-examine this initiative that was implemented prior to his confirmation,\" the Maine Republican said in a statement. Collins said she called Kennedy \"to express my strong opposition to these arbitrary cuts in funding for vital research\" in the state.",
      "Cancer research, heart disease and more",
      "The vast majority of medical research in the U.S. is supported by NIH funding, which \"includes over 2,800 hospitals, medical schools, universities, and other research institutions\" nationwide. Research for curing cancer and addressing chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease would be among the projects impacted, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities warned.",
      "The cost-cutting move implements an idea floated by conservatives for years. During President Trump's first term, the White House proposed sharply limiting the indirect costs paid by the NIH to 10%.",
      "\"We tried this in term 1 and NIH LOBBIED AGAINST Trump's policies and got Congress to block it. The consequence for those employees was exactly nothing,\" Joe Grogan, former director of the White House's domestic policy council, posted on X.",
      "The NIH justified the cutback as being similar to rates paid for these costs by other nonprofit foundations that subsidize medical research.",
      "\"The United States should have the best medical research in the world. It is accordingly vital to ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead,\" said the NIH's memo.",
      "The new guidance was attributed to the NIH director's office. The agency is currently headed by acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli, pending the Senate confirmation of President Trump's pick to head the NIH, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "Recipients of federal research dollars rejected characterizing the reimbursements as unnecessary, saying they are often needed to pay for costs like utility costs and lab maintenance and security.",
      "Those \"facilities and administration\" costs are difficult to attribute to on paper as direct costs of the research, they said, but are needed for the studies to continue.",
      "\"Make no mistake. This announcement will mean less research. Lights in labs nationwide will literally go out. Researchers and staff will lose their jobs,\" said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement.",
      "Calls for Congress to stop changes",
      "Some groups have called on Congress to step in. The cuts will affect institutions across the board, critics say, including in states that supported Republicans in the president's coalition.",
      "The Children's Hospital Association\u00a0asked\u00a0on Monday for lawmakers \"to prevent unilateral changes in the established processes\" for determining the indirect rates, citing \"current law and longstanding Congressional intent.\"",
      "\"Reducing the indirect cost rate will threaten the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children,\" the association said.",
      "For years, lawmakers from both parties have opposed efforts to cut NIH's funding of indirect costs, including in a clause added to a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2017.",
      "Grogan criticized the move, saying it blocked \"a rational discussion of how indirect cost rates should be calculated\" and efforts to ease unnecessary regulations.",
      "\"It's time for a transparent bipartisan discussion of whether taxpayers are getting cutting edge research out of NIH,\" said Grogan in an email.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down\"",
      "Current and former health officials say they were blindsided by the guidance change, which upends a long-running system by which federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down,\" said one former federal health official, who had worked with the team responsible for auditing indirect costs on NIH's behalf for years.",
      "That process starts with an extensive proposal submitted by researchers that goes through the federal Cost Allocation Services team within HHS, officials said, seeking to justify how they are planning to use the funds from a grant.",
      "The biggest portion of indirect costs usually goes towards paying for the facilities and equipment needed for biomedical research, not administrative costs. Federal research dollars cannot go towards paying for parts of the building and equipment that are not used for research.",
      "Federal health authorities often wage contentious negotiations with research institutions over those requests, resulting from inspections of the facilities and interrogations of the researchers working out of the buildings looking to \"poke holes\" in their submissions.",
      "\"We do not give away the farm. Whoever said that has never gone out on a site visit with us,\" said the former official.",
      "The former official said that artificially capping the rates below what they have negotiated with institutions ignores the work already done by health authorities to come up with current funding rates.",

    "story": [
      "A dairy worker in Nevada has been confirmed to be infected by a new bird flu strain found to be spreading among\u00a0cows in the state last week.",
      "That strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus, called D1.1 by scientists, is different from a previous variant called B3.13 which had infected at least 40 dairy workers in the U.S. to date.",
      "D1.1 was also behind a\u00a0fatal case in Louisiana in a person who was hospitalized last year, raising concerns that the strain might lead to more severe disease in humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 14 other cases last year have also been linked to D1.1 from birds, which did not result in hospitalization.",
      "B3.13 has led to only symptoms of conjunctivitis \u2014 or pink eye \u2014 in many cases and research suggests it is less severe for humans than other bird flu strains.",
      "So far, health authorities in Nevada say the dairy worker, who tested positive after working with sick cows in the state's Churchill County, had only pink eye as their symptom and is now recovering.",
      "\"There is currently no evidence of person to person spread of this virus. Close contacts of the infected person and other workers exposed at the farm are being contacted and monitored for symptoms and are being offered personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and antiviral medication,\" the Central Nevada Health District said in a statement.",
      "Owen Truesdell, a spokesperson for the health district, said there is currently no evidence of other dairy workers showing symptoms.",
      "\"Please note that this is an evolving situation and we will continue to communicate with reporters and the public when relevant new information is learned,\" Truesdell said in an email.",
      "Health officials have said for months that while the spread of the virus in animals warrants stepping up precautions for workers dealing with sick cows and birds, the risk to the general public remains low.",
      "\"This case involving cow-to-human spread of H5 in a person with higher-risk occupational exposure does not change CDC's risk assessment, which remains low for the public but is higher for people with occupational or recreational exposures,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Virologists have said that multiple key mutations would need to change in the virus before it could easily spread between humans, beyond the occasional dead-end spillovers seen so far from animals into humans.",
      "An analysis published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday found that one \"mammalian adaptation\" had been found in the virus from the D1.1-infected cows in Nevada last month, but said there was \"no evidence of onward transmission among humans.\"",
      "Will vaccines work for D1.1?",
      "While the seasonal flu vaccine is not designed to boost protection against H5N1, there are different kinds of vaccines that health authorities have prepared for a potential bird flu pandemic.",
      "Health authorities routinely test those pandemic vaccines against the bird flu virus to see if new strains have evolved to escape the protection from those shots.",
      "Previous testing by the CDC with D1.1 strains spreading in wild birds have found that the pandemic vaccines stockpiled by the U.S. government should still offer protection, two health officials told CBS News.",
      "Dr. Richard Webby, head of a World Health Organization influenza collaborating center at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, said those tests were done using antibodies after infection.",
      "\"It is anticipated that vaccination will induce an even better response,\" said Webby in an email.",
      "Why aren't we vaccinating for bird flu?",
      "Under the Biden administration last year, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response moved to prepare enough vials to vaccinate 2.4 million people if needed \u2014 but so far those doses have not been distributed for use.",
      "Officials said at the time that there was not yet a need to roll out the immunizations, citing the largely mild symptoms in infected workers and lack of human-to-human spread.",
      "Virtually all U.S. human cases of bird flu have been linked to direct contact with sick animals, often during intensive exposures like caring directly for sick animals or culling large flocks of infected birds. That includes the person who died in the Louisiana case, who had direct contact with sick birds.",
      "But there have also been three cases over the past year with an \"unknown\" exposure, where investigators were unable to track down a likely explanation for how people got sick.",
      "More clues to one of those bird flu cold cases could come this month, when the CDC is expected to have results from a study looking at blood samples that might reveal missed infections among contacts of a child sickened in San Francisco.",

      "Manufacturer FGF Brands issued the recall involving products products before December 13, 2024, the FDA said in an enforcement report published on Wednesday. The recall went into effect on January 7, 2025, but the FDA did not issue a press release.",
      "The recalled products included a range of chocolate, raspberry and Bavarian doughnuts, French crullers, \u00e9clairs and coffee rolls.",
      "Dunkin' responded to a request for comment by citing a statement by FGF Brands.",
      "In it, the company said it wanted to clarify coverage of its recall to \"ensure customers have not been misled or confused.\"",
      "The recall was completed in early January and came as the result of findings at one of the company's doughnut facilities in the U.S., it stated. No food had tested positive for listeria and doughnuts currently on the market are safe to eat, it added.",
      "Listeria is the third-leading cause of death from food-borne illness in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Most people who consume food contaminated with the bacteria don't get sick, but pregnant women, infants and older people, along with those with weakened immune systems can become seriously ill or die, the CDC stated.",
      "An estimated 1,600 Americans are infected with listeria each year, and about 260 people die from the bacteria, the agency said.",

    "summary": "A program begun in Zimbabwe in which grandmothers and older listeners serve as \"first responders\" for those seeking mental health assistance in underserved communities has now expanded to nine countries, including the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Dixon Chibanda remembers like yesterday the moment in 2005 that changed his life. \"During my formative years working as a psychiatrist, I lost a patient of mine to suicide. Erica was her name. She had hanged herself from a mango tree in the family garden.\"",
      "Erica was just 25 years old.",
      "Chibanda, a psychiatrist based in Harare, Zimbabwe, says her family knew she needed help. \"They lived some 200 miles away from where I worked,\" he said. \"And they just didn't have the equivalent of US$15 to get onto a bus to come to the hospital.\"",
      "At the time, there were only 10 psychiatrists serving 13 million people in Zimbabwe. So, Chibanda came up with an idea involving grandmothers: \"These grandmas were actually, you know, the custodians of the local culture and the wisdom, and they were rooted in their communities. And I was like, what if we could train them to be the first port of call for anyone needing to talk in a community?\"",
      "So, in 2006, Chibanda introduced the \"Friendship Bench,\" a talk therapy program that brings mental healthcare directly into underserved communities. The program is free, and the grandmothers were happy to donate their time.",
      "He chronicled this journey in a new book: \"The Friendship Bench: How Fourteen Grandmothers Inspired a Mental Health Revolution\" (New World Library).",
      "\"When I first started this, in fact we called it the Mental Health Bench,\" he said. \"Interestingly, nobody came to the Mental Health Bench, because of the stigma, until the grandmas said, 'You know, why don't you turn it into a Friendship Bench?'\"",
      "During that first year, 14 volunteer grandmothers shared a Friendship Bench with several hundred visitors in that one suburb. Chibanda says the program has since expanded beyond grandmothers to include over 3,000 older listeners who last year saw more than 300,000 people all over Zimbabwe.",
      "He said, \"There are a lot of people out there who are struggling to just connect with another human being. And this gives them that opportunity, to be able to sit down with someone who is empathic.\"",
      "Globally, just under 300 million people are struggling with depression, according to the World Health Organization. Only about one-third of them receive any treatment. And at a time when we're facing an epidemic of loneliness and isolation affecting 1 in 5 American adults (according to a 2024 Gallup poll), the Friendship Bench is hitting the road, expanding to vulnerable communities in 9 countries and counting, including the United States.",
      "At the Washington Seniors Wellness Center, in our nation's capital, the program is being piloted by the nonprofit organization HelpAge USA, which focuses on the inclusion of older people.",
      "Seventy-four-year-old Arnette Ibitayo says she was struggling with the deaths of her son and brother. \"My son's was sudden; he had a heart attack at 44,\" she said. \"And then my brother had COVID.\"",
      "She turned to the Friendship Bench. \"So I'm, you know, feeling down, depressed,\" she said. \"I think I need to talk to somebody, because I felt like isolating and staying home. And it was very comforting to get it out. And I wasn't judged, and I was able to speak freely, and the person gave me some helpful advice.\"",
      "That person was Theresa Kelly, a retired schoolteacher, who listened to Ibitayo's story. \"We don't solve problems for them,\" Kelly said. \"Sometimes you don't realize that you can be your own problem solver. And when they finish, we want them to leave empowered.\"",
      "A screening process refers more serious cases to professionals. For almost 20 years now, Dr. Chibanda has been using his medical training to help analyze and improve the program. \"The Friendship Bench is actually rooted in a lot of research,\" he said. \"These grandmas were a lot more effective than trained mental health professionals at alleviating symptoms of both depression and generalized anxiety disorders.\"",
      "Arnette Ibitayo said she felt better after just one session with Kelly: \"I was more at ease. It worked. It was working.\"",
      "\"You feel a little less depressed now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, uh-huh. There's hope that things are going to be better.\"",
      "So, what's the special sauce when it comes to grandparents? According to Chibanda, it is \"the natural abilities that come with having a long-lived life on the planet. They've seen a lot. They've experienced a lot. They have, you know, the battle scars of life, which they bring to the bench. All we're doing as Friendship Bench is helping them to use those stories, those experiences, to help others.\"",
      "And the bench is giving them something back. Theresa Kelly said, \"I love helping people, empowering people. It makes me feel good. Makes me feel that [I have] still another purpose, that after retirement there's still something, you know, that I can do that can help others, that it's not over.\"",

    "title": "Trump says the federal workforce is too big. Here's what to know.",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 09:14:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The federal government is the nation's largest employer, yet the size of its workforce hasn't kept up with U.S. population growth, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is moving swiftly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 a move that he has said will slash wasteful spending and make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's dictates.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the federal government as \"bloated\" and filled with \"people that are unnecessary.\" While the federal government has inefficiencies, as do all large and complex organizations, some experts are pointing out that the government workforce has grown little since 1980, and that some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration and the FAA's air traffic control centers.",
      "\"There's no indication that the government is particularly bloated in terms of numbers of federal workers \u2014 that number hasn't really changed over the past decades,\" Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The problem we were facing over the past decades isn't one of bloat, but of vacancies.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees\u00a0\u2014 who generally have less than a year on the job and who aren't yet covered by civil service protections \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "As Mr. Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency push to slash spending, here's what to know about the nation's federal workforce and the potential impact on Americans of scaling back government.",
      "What are Trump and Musk doing to shrink the federal workforce?",
      "Working with billionaire Elon Musk, Mr. Trump has offered a \"deferred resignation\" plan to more than 2 million federal employees, that would grant pay through the end of September while not working, in exchange for agreeing to step down. A federal judge on Tuesday cleared the program to proceed after it had been paused.",
      "About 75,000 workers have accepted the offer, and the Trump administration said that the deferred resignation program was closed as of 7 p.m. Feb. 12. The offer excludes members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security.",
      "In another move aimed at remaking the federal workforce, Mr. Trump this week also signed an executive order to reduce the number of government employees and limit hiring.",
      "The administration's order on Thursday to cut probationary workers is expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. According to federal data, there are about 220,000 federal workers with less than a year on the job, representing about 9% of the government workforce.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Is the federal workforce growing?",
      "As Mr. Trump and Musk charge ahead, some policy experts note that the federal workforce has decreased relative to the U.S. population when compared with earlier decades. The upshot: There are fewer government workers providing services to more U.S. residents than in prior years, according to new research from the Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "The federal workforce has waxed and waned over the years, but its size today puts it on the same footing as during the 1980s, when the U.S. population was about 220 million. Today, there are more than 330 million U.S. residents.",
      "How big is the federal workforce?",
      "The U.S. has more than 2.4 million federal workers, excluding those who work for the U.S. Postal Service, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (As a self-funded agency, the USPS relies on sales of stamps and other products and services to support its operations.)",
      "\"In absolute terms, the federal workforce is slightly smaller than it was 50 years ago, even though the U.S. population has increased by two-thirds during that time period,\" noted Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "In the 1940s, the federal workforce represented 4.5% of non-farm workers, a share that's dwindled to 1.5% today, according to CEPR's analysis.",
      "How efficient is the federal workforce?",
      "There's no overarching measure of the efficiency of the federal workforce, Linos of Harvard's Kennedy School noted. But agencies typically review their own operations to identify gaps that affect their ability to provide services.",
      "The federal workforce's efficiency should be measured on whether agencies are delivering the services they've been tasked to handle, she added. In recent years, many agencies have added data-driven measurements to determine whether they are providing those services to Americans.",
      "For instance, the Social Security Administration's most recent annual performance report identified long wait times for callers as a trouble spot, and added that it would like to shave the hold times to 12 minutes on average from its 34 minute on-hold time for fiscal year 2024. But that \"aspirational goal\" was being evaluated amid a hiring freeze, the report added.",
      "The Social Security Administration, which last year served a record 68 million beneficiaries, is working with its smallest staff in 50 years, former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in November congressional testimony.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. government suffers from various types of inefficiencies, with a 2024 U.S. Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0estimating that as much as $521 billion annually is lost to fraud, or about 8% of federal spending.",
      "Federal spending also has ballooned in recent years, although much of the increase is due to higher spending on Social Security and paying interest on federal debt,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "What agencies have the most federal workers?",
      "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has the most federal workers, with more than 487,000 employees, according to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. That's followed by the Department of Homeland Security, with more than 222,000 workers; and the U.S. Army, with 221,000 employees.",
      "Some of the agencies that have been targeted by Mr. Trump are relatively small by comparison. For instance, the president is considering an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, which has about 4,200 employees.",
      "Where are federal workers based geographically?",
      "Only about 7% of federal workers are located in Washington, D.C., proper, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. But when adding the federal workers located in Virginia and Maryland, the larger Washington, D.C., metro area represents about 20% of the entire government workforce.",
      "Roughly 80% of federal workers are located outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and civil service employees are employed in every U.S. state, the CRS report noted.",
      "While Washington, D.C., proper has the largest number of federal workers, at about 162,000, other states aren't far behind: California employs about 147,000 federal workers, while Texas has about 130,000.",
      "Additional states with sizable federal workforces include Florida, at about 94,000, and Georgia, with almost 80,000 federal workers, the analysis found.",
      "What does the typical federal worker earn?",
      "The average annual salary of federal workers tops $106,000, Pew Research Center found, citing OPM data.",
      "Federal salaries skew into the six figures because many civil service workers hold college or professional degrees, and are highly trained. The largest share of federal workers are employed in the medical field \u2014 physicians and nurses who work for the VA, for instance.",
      "Others are professionals such as accountants and attorneys who might be able to earn more if they worked for private employers. For instance, the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts and other derivatives, pays its employees an average of $235,910. About 40% of its workforce is comprised of attorneys, Pew found.",
      "How could a much smaller federal workforce affect Americans?",
      "Services could degrade if enough federal workers are cut or resign, Harvard's Linos said. But Americans would still expect a certain level of service, such as getting their benefits paid on time or getting a passport on a timely basis.",
      "To address that issue, the federal government could turn to private-sector contractors to pick up the slack, she added. \"That's more costly \u2014 you end up paying a higher wage to private sector workers with less accountability,\" she noted.",
      "A hit to public services could heighten negative public sentiment about the federal government, Linos added. Public trust in the federal government has declined for decades, falling from about 77% of people in the 1960s who trust the government to do what is right to about 22% today, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\"We tell people the government is bloated, the day-to-day experience gets worse, and that feeds the narrative that the government is useless,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Federal layoffs are starting with huge numbers of probationary workers, and there are warnings of bigger cuts on the way.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who hadn't yet gained civil service protection - potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming.",
      "The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "Even workers in the personnel office itself weren't immune: Dozens of probationary employees at OPM were told on a Thursday afternoon group call that they were being dismissed and then instructed to leave the building within a half-hour, according to another person who likewise spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Elon Musk, to whom the president has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration \"abused\" the probation status of workers \"to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\"",
      "Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job - the most recent data available.",
      "The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.",
      "At least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.",
      "The layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said Thursday.",
      "Murray said in a statement that she heard from VA researchers in her state who were told to stop their research immediately, \"not because their work isn't desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.\"",
      "The VA announced Thursday that it had laid off more than 1,000 non-\"mission critical\" probationary workers and the move would \"save the department more than $98 million per year, and VA will redirect all of those resources back toward health care, benefits and services for VA beneficiaries.\"",
      "Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.",
      "The civilian federal workforce , not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C. and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.",
      "Layoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.",
      "\"Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,\" said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. \"They're younger and presumably have better skills, and that's who you want.\"",
      "Mr, Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a \"buyout,: which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration's target, and Mr. Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.",
      "The order the president signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.",
      "Mr. Trump has praised Musk's work to slash federal spending.",
      "The Republican president has also been sharply critical of federal workers, especially those who want to keep working remotely, though his administration is simultaneously working to cut federal office space and ordering the termination of worksite leases throughout the government.",
      "\"Nobody is gonna work from home,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"They are gonna be going out, they're gonna play tennis, they're gonna play golf, they're gonna do a lot of things. They're not working.\""

      "In an eleventh-hour agreement late Thursday night, YouTube TV reached what it called a \"short-term extension\" with Paramount to keep channels such as CBS, Comedy Central and MTV on its subscription streaming service after access to them was set to go dark following failed negotiations around a contract renewal.",
      "\"Subscribers continue to have access to Paramount channels, including CBS. We appreciate your patience as we continue to negotiate on your behalf,\" YouTube TV announced in a social media post\u00a0late Thursday night.",
      "The period\u00a0of the extension was not provided. CBS News has reached out to Paramount, its parent company, for comment.",
      "The dispute\u00a0has centered on what are known as carriage fees, which are the payments that paid TV providers like YouTube make to broadcasters for the right to carry the broadcaster's programming. Conflicts between providers and broadcast players have become increasingly common in recent years, leading to regular channel and content blackouts.",
      "\"Paramount has a long track record of successfully and amicably renewing partnerships with every major distributor, including several in recent months, and we will continue our efforts to reach a new agreement with YouTube TV,\" a spokesperson for Paramount stated prior to the announcement of the short-term deal.",
      "\"YouTube TV is attempting to pressure Paramount to agree to one-sided terms, and these non-market demands may lead to an avoidable loss of Paramount's networks on YouTube TV, in addition to the removal of Paramount+ and BET+ from YouTube's Primetime Channels, on February 13,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Carriage-fee fights can lead to frustrations for viewers, such as when a 2024 dispute between the Walt Disney Co. and DirecTV led to a blackout of several popular Disney-owned channels and streaming services, for millions of DirectTV customers.",
      "\"We've been working hard to reach a fair agreement with Paramount that allows us to keep their channels, including CBS and CBS Sports, on YouTube,\" Alphabet's YouTube stated in an earlier programming update. If an agreement had not been reached and the content was not available for \"an extended period of time,\" subscribers would get an $8 credit, YouTube stated.",
      "YouTube TV also told customers that they can sign up for Paramount+ to continue watching CBS and related content. CBS News is owned by Paramount Global, which offers the streaming service Paramount+.",
      "Google did not respond to a request for comment earlier Thursday.",
      "The video service has more than 8 million subscribers, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan\u00a0said last year. The disagreement follows YouTube TV in January increasing the cost of its basic package by 10 bucks to $82.99 a month.",

    "summary": "America's trading partners keep their markets to closed to U.S. exports, White House says in ordering up plan to impose global tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum directing his administration to weigh reciprocal tariffs, threatening to impose levies on U.S. imports from nations that put higher duties on American products.",
      "\"I've decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office at a proclamation signing. \"It's fair to all. No other country can complain.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its tariff policies would level the competitive playing field for U.S. and foreign manufacturers, although the new taxes would probably be shouldered by U.S. shoppers and businesses either directly or indirectly.",
      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again. Consumer prices in January\u00a0accelerated\u00a0to 3% on an annual basis, signaling the Federal Federal's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has petered out, at least for now.",
      "Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note earlier this week that proceeding with reciprocal U.S. tariffs poses \"additional upside risks to the inflation outlook.\"",
      "Trade negotiations",
      "The tariff hikes would vary for affected countries, with a goal of starting new trade negotiations, the Associated Press reported. A senior White House official who spoke to the wire service on condition of anonymity said the reviews required to move forward with the tariffs could be finished within a number of weeks, although the process could take longer.",
      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",
      "President Trump has placed an additional tariff on Chinese imports for what he says is that nation's role in producing opioid fentanyl. He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico that could take effect next month, after being paused 30 days. Mr. Trump also this week announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that are scheduled to take effect in March.",
      "Applying a matching tariff against select U.S. trading partners is likely an alternative to imposing a more sweeping levy, according to economists. Argentina, Brazil, India and Turkey have the biggest gaps in tariffs with the U.S., trade data shows.",
      "\"While most developed markets would come out relatively unscathed, emerging markets would suffer a greater loss of competitiveness, with India, Brazil and Turkey looking among the most exposed,\" Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report. \"It is probable that their governments (among others) would provide concessions to President Trump in an attempt to prevent reciprocal tariffs from being imposed.\"",
      "Trump administration officials say tariffs can protect domestic manufacturers and also spur both American and foreign companies to create more jobs in the U.S.",

      "Thousands of Californians who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires last month are now grappling with insurance claims. And with research showing that extreme weather today\u00a0poses a threat to nearly half of all U.S. homes, it's important to know exactly how much coverage you have so that when disaster strikes, you're not left standing in the rubble.",
      "Indeed, as many as 3 in 4 U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, reports CBS News national consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi. That means more Americans should get to know their insurance policies, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the nonprofit After the Fire USA.",
      "\"Well, the first thing you have to do is actually read your policy, and most of us don't do that, and so really encourage you to either sit down with somebody who is an expert in insurance \u2014 your underwriter [the insurance company] will be able to do this with you,\" Thompson told Quraishi.",
      "How much coverage do I need?",
      "Determining how much insurance you have, versus what you need to rebuild your a home in case of a disaster, is relatively straighforward. Start by taking the dollar amount of your policy coverage limit and dividing that by the square footage of your house or apartment.",
      "The resulting figure should equal the average construction cost per square foot in your area \u2014 a dollar amount Quraishi said you can find by doing an online search for \"construction cast per square foot,\" along with your zip code.",
      "For those who discover they have no protection of any kind of natural disaster, or after doing the math find that they're not sufficiently covered, the next step should be to get the maximum amount of coverage they can.",
      "\"Do go to your underwriter and ask,\" Thompson said. \"Max out on your insurance \u2014 it does cost us a little bit more every single month, but it's just incredibly important. Some people won't call because they're afraid of being dropped. Do not do that.\"",
      "Make a list of all your things",
      "Your home insurance policy should also cover possessions, also known as contents insurance. To be sure you're fully covered, make a list of all of your belongings, along with their estimated value. Update the list every year and let your agent know about any large purchases, from jewelry to cars.",
      "\"Most people don't even know they have contents insurance as part of their insurance policy,\" Thompson said. \"See how much it is.\"",
      "When to call Fema",
      "If you find yourself in the middle of a crisis while underinsured, you can contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 800-621-3362 from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Pacific time seven days a week. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also may be able to provide assistance and negotiate with your insurance company.",
      "What if you think you're underinsured?",
      "If after reading your policy and calculating your coverage you determine you're underinsured, but your insurance provider insists that you're fine, Thompson suggests having them put that in writing.",
      "\"Ask them to actually put it in writing \u2014 an email or something back to you that is official saying that you are adequately insured,\" she said. \"You must have it in writing and in some way that you can easily access it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Egg prices continue to soar \u2014 if shoppers can even find them in grocery stores.",
      "In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S.\u00a0jumped more than 15%\u00a0from a year ago, to roughly $4.95 a dozen. That's\u00a0five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 \u2014 a 170% increase, according to CBS News' price tracker\u00a0of everyday goods.",
      "The spike in egg prices last month underscores the devastating impact of avian flu, which killed more than 40 million egg-laying birds last year. Including ducks and chickens, 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, began spreading around the U.S. in 2022.",
      "If there's any good news, it's that egg prices are at least expected to rise more slowly over the course of the year. The January surge \"is likely a one-off,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. But that may come as small consolation for the millions of consumers who continue to grapple with higher food costs both at home and in restaurants due to record-high egg prices.",
      "Why are egg prices so high?",
      "The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise.",
      "\"If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg,\" Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family.",
      "\"High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale,\" Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have less supply, that drives up the prices.\"",
      "Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University.",
      "Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs.",
      "\"We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand,\" he said. \"Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices.\"",
      "Retailers rationing eggs",
      "Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time.",
      "Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase \"to ensure more customers can have access to eggs,\" a spokesperson for the retailer said.",
      "\"Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible,\" the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S.",
      "As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. \"We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed,\" they added.",
      "Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit.",
      "Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs \"at or below our cost across all our supermarkets\" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit.",
      "Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "When will egg prices drop?",
      "Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices.",
      "Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain.",
      "\"it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population,\" Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand.",
      "In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks,\" he said.",
      "Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas.",

      "\"This is not a good number,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said in an email of January's CPI data. \"This is almost starting to look like a re-run of the first half of 2024, when inflation surprised everyone (including the Fed) on the upside.\"",
      "He added, \"And it illustrates how the Fed has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The new data shows that inflation picked up speed at the start of the President Trump's second administration, which has signaled its intention to enact broad-based tariffs, including newly announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",
      "Because tariffs are essentially taxes on imports that are largely passed through to U.S. consumers, Mr. Trump's import duties, if enacted, could push inflation higher in 2025, economists are forecasting.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 16:31:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Although President Trump can't overturn the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, experts say he can change how it is enforced.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) praise it as an important anti-bribery statute that keeps corporations honest when doing business outside the U.S. By contrast, the law's detractors say it unfairly hobbles American companies, giving an advantage to foreign players.",
      "On Monday, President Trump took a side. \"It sounds good on paper but in practicality, it's a disaster,\" he said while signing an executive order \u00a0freezing enforcement of the 1977 law. \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump can't overturn the law, but as head of the executive branch he can change the way it is enforced and shift resources to other Justice Department priorities.",
      "His order puts in place a 180-day \"pause\" to all investigations under the FCPA while they are being reviewed. He also ordered no new ones be opened during that period. The order also says it will halt other Justice Department \"actions\" under the law, which might mean ongoing prosecutions though that is unclear.",
      "President Trump said the pause is also necessary to give his administration time to come up with new \"reasonable\" guidelines on how to enforce the law that don't put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in striking foreign deals.",
      "The consequences could be dramatic, depending on Mr. Trump's next move, experts say.",
      "If he halts many prosecutions, essentially defanging the law, it could help U.S. businesses win deals abroad. However, doing so could also tarnish America's image as a safe place to do business, and also send a green light to corrupt autocrats ruling over impoverished people to get even richer. France, Britain, Japan and other wealthy countries could also in turn weaken their own anti-bribery laws so their companies can make payments, too.",
      "\"We are facing a Wild West situation,\" said Mark Pieth, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland and anti-bribery law expert. \"It will be everyone against everyone.\"",
      "Specifically, Mr. Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

With USAID funding paused, there is concern among U.S. farmers about the market for some of their products, including Kansas sorghum producers, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal.",
      "While the future of USAID's funding and its purchases from U.S. farmers remains unclear, there is currently $489 million worth of food sitting \"at ports, in transit, and in warehouses at risk of spoilage, unanticipated storage needs, and diversion,\" the Feb. 10 USAID inspector general report said.",
      "An additional 500,000 additional metric tons of food is currently on ships or ready to be shipped abroad, the report added. USAID typically buys commodities such as wheat, soybeans, sorghum and split peas from U.S. farmers.",
      "\"When the food doesn't get to where it needs to go, it winds up in a landfill, and that has devastating effects,\" Ashley Stanley, the CEO of Spoonfuls, which redirects excess food from grocers and other companies to aid organizations in Massachusetts, told CBS Boston.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, which has been tasked with overseeing USAID, said on Feb. 12 that Secretary Marco Rubio has coordinated with the Department of Agriculture to resume USAID's food aid program, called Food for Peace.",
      "\"This includes $396 million in agricultural commodities (542,000 metric tons) currently in the supply chain from the U.S. to countries in crisis around the world,\" the State Department spokesperson said.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Tuesday\u00a0fired the USAID inspector general one day after he released the report detailing the potential food spoilage. Paul Martin, the ousted inspector general, was given no reason for his dismissal in a two-sentence email from Trent Morse, deputy director of the White House's Office of Presidential Personnel.",

    "summary": "President Trump and other critics of the agency say it needs to be shut down. Supporters of the agency point to its record of protecting consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Feb. 8 order that employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau halt much of their work amounts to an existential crisis for a government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules. Some of the agency's achievements, according to the CFPB and consumer advocates:",
      "Securing $20 billion in relief for consumers, including reducing loan balances and erasing debt, since the agency's launchImposing $5 billion in civil monetary penalties against businesses and individuals who violate consumer protection lawsPenalizing banks and other companies for activities such as opening fake accounts and improperly charging \"junk\" feesBanning excessive credit card late-payment fees (a federal judge in 2024 moved to block that CFPB rule)Tightening rules for \"buy now, pay later\" loans, ensuring that consumers who use this increasingly form of credit are protectedSafeguarding U.S. servicemembers from illegal loansBanning medical debt from from consumers' credit report",

      "\"It's a law enforcement agency. It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",
      "That said, what the president has in mind for the agency is unclear, as Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to shut the CFPB down one day earlier.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",

      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",

    "summary": "A new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleges that Starbucks is unlawfully relying on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices.\"",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks faces a new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleging the restaurant chain relies on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices\" that violate federal and state laws. The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",
      "In a statement to CBS News responding to Missouri's suit, Starbucks said, \"We disagree with the attorney general, and these allegations are inaccurate. We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",
      "Critics of DEI say employers should make their hiring decisions based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other legally protected categories. The Missouri lawsuit echoes those arguments, alleging that Starbucks' hiring practices discriminates against residents of the state.",
      "\"Starbucks' policies harm the many Missourians whom work, or would like to work, at Starbucks, but have been, are being or will be discriminated against as future victims on the basis of their race, sex, or inclusion in other protected groups,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has vowed to tackle some of those issues, pledging last year to simplify beverage customizations and saying customers should receive their drinks in four minutes or less.",
      "Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain, has also said he wants to make Starbucks' locations \"inviting places to linger.\"",
      "As part of that goal, Starbucks reversed its open-door policy last month after almost seven years, now requiring that people make a purchase if they want to hang out in its stores or use restrooms. The company adopted those policies in 2018 after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting.",
      "Negative publicity over the incident, which was caught on video and widely shared over social media, embarrassed the company and led to its now abandoned open-door policy.",

Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",

      "President Trump's tariffs on aluminum could make Coca-Cola more expensive.",

      "Quincey said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that if the tariffs go into effect, making aluminum cans more expensive, the company could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "Quincey also said the impact of the new tariffs could be negligible.",
      "\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"",
      "Coke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.",
      "\"As the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through,\" he said.",

    "title": "Here's how Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs could impact U.S. prices",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 06:58:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Monday ordered new tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports. Experts say some products could become pricier.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is again turning to tariffs to advance his trade agenda, signing new orders to place 25% import duties on all steel and aluminum imports. Although the idea is to protect U.S. manufacturers from unfair competition, consumers could end up paying more for some products that use the metals, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump, who signed two executive orders on Monday imposing the new metal tariffs, has said that such duties can help revitalize key U.S. industries. For instance, some companies could opt to open new plants in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while buyers could shift to U.S.-made products rather than pricier imports.",
      "\"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands we need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",
      "The new metal tariffs affect a total of about $50 billion in imports. The U.S. imports roughly a quarter of domestically used steel, with most of it sourced from Canada and Mexico, along with countries including Brazil, South Korea and Japan, according to the International Trade Administration.",
      "Who pays for tariffs",
      "Because U.S. importers pay tariffs on overseas goods directly to the federal government, the costs are typically passed onto American consumers, trade experts told CBS MoneyWatch. That means some products that rely on steel and aluminum, such as vehicles and appliances, are likely to become more expensive if the steel and aluminum tariffs go into effect.",
      "\"If you put a tax on imported steel and aluminum, you will raise the price of everything that uses that \u2014 cars first and foremost,\" said Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research.",
      "A typical car contains roughly 1,000 pounds of steel at a cost of about about $6,000 to $7,000 per vehicle, Baker told CBS MoneyWatch. That means adding a 25% tariff could increase the cost of a car by $1,000 to $1,500, he estimated. Although some automakers might shift to buying more U.S.-made steel, American manufacturers would also likely boost their prices, taking advantage of the higher costs for foreign-made steel, he added.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. car prices could rise even more sharply if Mr. Trump proceeds with 25% tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports, now subject to a 30-day pause\u00a0as officials negotiate. The impact of those tariffs would\u00a0add $6,250 to the average $25,000 price of a car shipped into the U.S. from those two countries, according to an analysis by S&P Global Mobility.",
      "Under Mr. Trump's orders, steel imports from all countries will now face 25% tariffs, while aluminum tariffs will be raised from 10% to 25%. The orders were instituted under\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the president to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are determined to threaten national security.",
      "Tariffs could drive up inflation",
      "Mr. Trump's plans to lean on new tariffs to enact his trade and other policy objectives has prompted some economists to forecast higher inflation in 2025. While it's not clear that Mr. Trump will enact all the tariffs he's outlined \u2014 he recently gave a 30-day reprieve to Mexico and Canada in his plan to enact 25% import duties on those countries \u2014 the president is also signaling plans to move forward with additional tariffs.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump said that, in addition to the steel and aluminum tariffs, he planned to announce \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Tuesday or Wednesday, which he said will take effect immediately. Under that scenario, the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.",
      "\"If they charge us, we charge them \u2026 every country,\" Mr. Trump said, adding, \"If they are charging us 130% and we're charging them nothing, it's not going to stay that way.\"",
      "Economists and Wall Street analysts warn that new U.S. tariffs, if sustained, could cause inflation to flare even as many Americans say they continue struggling with the cost of living. Mr. Trump's latest proposed steel and aluminum tariffs, plus the reciprocal tariffs, could boost the core personal consumption expenditures price index \u2014 a key measure of inflation \u2014 by an additional 0.4 percentage points, Deutsche Bank economists estimate in a Feb. 10 research report.",
      "If the postponed tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada go into effect after the 30-day pause, inflation could rise higher than 3.5%, they added.",
      "The long-term impact on U.S. prices is less certain and is contingent on how manufacturers react.",
      "\"U.S. steel prices will likely rise in the near term if these tariffs are implemented in full,\" economists with Capital Economics said in a report. \"However, higher prices might incentivize greater domestic production and help prices to fall back before long.\"",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, steel producers increased their output after tariffs were imposed, while domestic demand fell. Within 12 months, those factors contributed to steel prices declining to their level before the tariffs were imposed, Capital Economics noted.",
      "A jump in prices, coupled with rising inflation expectations, would come at an awkward time for consumers and for Mr. Trump. While he has received positive approval ratings for his first three weeks in office, two-thirds of voters said that they don't believe he's doing enough to lower the price of goods and services, according to a recent CBS News poll.",
      "Inflation around the U.S. remains sticky, with the Federal Reserve pausing additional interest rate cuts until the rate of consumer price gains falls closer to its 2% annual target. Consumer Price Index data for January, scheduled to be released on Wednesday, is expected to show that prices rose 2.9% in January, unchanged from the prior month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "\"These are uncertain times, and the biggest uncertainty with inflation is definitely the tariffs,\" Baker of CEPR said.",

      "\"A lot goes into flower prices \u2014 it's not solely the rise in the price of goods, but more of a function of an entire agricultural system that relies on transportation, logistics, and of course, weather,\" Josh Koebert, a senior researcher at FinanceBuzz, said in an email.",
      "He said prices this year are more in line with inflation, versus last year when there were other factors like \"erratic weather patterns impacting flower production around the world, increased costs associated with shipping and the supply chain post-COVID, and general increased demand for plants and flowers.\"",

      "The journey of a rose from the farm to the consumer is a meticulous process that involves multiple stages, Penn said.",
      "\"It begins with breeders who invest years in developing commercially viable roses. These roses are cultivated for their rich, pigmented colors, beautiful bloom shapes, and long vase life,\" Penn said. \"Beyond aesthetics, breeders focus on ensuring the roses are disease-resistant and durable enough to withstand transportation.\"",
      "Post-harvest, roses are stored in nutrient solutions and temperature-controlled environments to maintain freshness. Upon arrival in the U.S., they undergo inspection before reaching florists. Florists then clean, de-thorn, hydrate and craft each bouquet.",

They inspect the shipments for posts and diseases that \"could harm U.S. agricultural and floral industries.\"",
      "From mid-January to mid-February, the agency sends extra agricultural specialists to the Miami Field Office to support local inspectors handling the surge in cut flower imports. This helps ensure that the\u00a0 flowers reach retailers in time for Valentine's Day.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who hadn't yet gained civil service protection - potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming.",
      "The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "Even workers in the personnel office itself weren't immune: Dozens of probationary employees at OPM were told on a Thursday afternoon group call that they were being dismissed and then instructed to leave the building within a half-hour, according to another person who likewise spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Elon Musk, to whom the president has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration \"abused\" the probation status of workers \"to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\"",
      "Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job - the most recent data available.",
      "The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.",
      "At least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.",

      "Layoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.",
      "\"Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,\" said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. \"They're younger and presumably have better skills, and that's who you want.\"",

The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration's target, and Mr. Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.",

In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.",
      "Mr. Trump has praised Musk's work to slash federal spending.",
      "The Republican president has also been sharply critical of federal workers, especially those who want to keep working remotely, though his administration is simultaneously working to cut federal office space and ordering the termination of worksite leases throughout the government.",
      "\"Nobody is gonna work from home,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"They are gonna be going out, they're gonna play tennis, they're gonna play golf, they're gonna do a lot of things. They're not working.\""

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 08:16:12 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's executive action sought to restrict access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Maryland agreed Thursday to temporarily halt President Trump's executive action that restricts access to gender-affirming care for people under the age of 19, delivering a setback to the Trump administration efforts targeting what it calls \"gender ideology\" while the legal proceedings move forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge Brendan Hurson issued a temporary restraining order from the bench following a hearing on their bid to temporarily block enforcement of the restrictions.",
      "The challengers have argued that the Trump administration's actions violate the Constitution and discriminate on the basis of sex and transgender status. Hurson's order prevents federal agencies from conditioning or withholding funds based on the fact that a medical provider offers gender-affirming care to a young patient. It will remain in place for 14 days.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive action requires federal agencies to ensure medical institutions that receive federal research or education grants end the so-called \"chemical and surgical mutilation of children,\" defined as those under the age of 19. Medical treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order states.",
      "Mr. Trump's measure also calls for federally run insurance programs like TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and Medicaid to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from coverage.",
      "The measure came on the heels of other executive action taken by the president on his first day back in office that prohibits the use of federal funds to \"promote gender ideology\" and declares U.S. policy as recognizing only \"two sexes, male and female.\"",
      "The young people who are part of the lawsuit include two 12-year-olds who identify as transgender, and five transgender teenagers. All were diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to court filings. Joining them in the case are the organizations PFLAG, a nonprofit that advocates for LGBTQ people, and the American Association of Physicians for Human Rights.",
      "In their bid for the court to halt Mr. Trump's action, the challengers noted that hospitals around the country have abruptly halted medical care for transgender young people. In the case of one of the plaintiffs, identified in court papers as 14-year-old Gabe Goe, he and his parents were told that Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C., would no longer issue new prescriptions or process refills for treatments to address his gender dysphoria.",
      "\"The orders gravely threaten transgender people in the United States by pitting the health and wellbeing of that vulnerable minority population against the health and wellbeing of countless others and millions of dollars in federal funding,\" the plaintiffs wrote in a court filing.",
      "In arguing that the president's orders are unlawful and unconstitutional, the plaintiffs said Mr. Trump does not have the power to unilaterally withhold funds that have been authorized by Congress and signed into law.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, said the president has the authority to direct agencies to implement his agenda.",
      "\"This well-established authority dooms plaintiffs' likelihood of succeeding on their claim that the president exceeded his presidential authority in issuing the EOs,\" Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing. \"Plaintiffs also are unlikely to succeed on their constitutional and statutory discrimination claims: the EOs do not discriminate based on sex or any other protected class, and they bear a substantial relationship to important governmental objectives regarding the protection of children and adolescents from potentially dangerous and ineffective treatments such that they satisfy any possible standard of constitutional scrutiny anyway.\"",

      "In the video, Smith said \"this decision is not political, it is entirely personal.\"",
      "\"After 20 years of hard and rewarding work in the public sector, I'm ready to spend more time with my family,\" she added.",

      "She also said \"we have a deep bench of political talent in Minnesota \u2014 a group of leaders that are more than ready to pick up the work and carry us forward, and I'm excited to make room for them to move forward.\"",
      "In an interview with WCCO on Thursday, Smith said she has \"a real sense of clarity that this is the right thing for me to be doing right now, and a lot of excitement for what's going to come next, and a lot of energy for the next two years.\"",
      "\"These next two years seem incredibly important to me.

      "Smith's background, path to Senate",
      "Smith has held the U.S. Senate seat since 2018; she was first appointed to the position after former Sen. Al Franken resigned due to allegations of sexual harassment. She then beat Republican Karin Housley in the special election that November and was reelected in 2020. Before taking on the role of senator, Smith served as the state's lieutenant governor for Gov. Mark Dayton. She also served as chief of staff for both Dayton and Mayor R.T. Rybak.",

As the only Senator to have worked at Planned Parenthood, Tina quickly became a leader in Washington in the fight to protect women's rights. Tina also bravely shared her own story as part of her work to strengthen mental health services for all Americans. Her quiet but effective governing style earned her the title the velvet hammer. While Tina and I will continue to work together for the next two years, our friendship and her legacy will last a lifetime.\"",

      "Unlike Louisiana, Texas didn't file criminal charges against Carpenter but accused her in a December lawsuit of violating state law by prescribing abortion medication via telemedicine. Texas has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the nation.",
      "State District Judge Bryan Gantt issued the fine against Carpenter and ordered her to pay attorney's fees. He also issued an injunction barring Carpenter from prescribing abortion medication to Texas residents. Gantt noted in his order that despite being notified, Carpenter failed to appear in court.",

    "summary": "Organizations that receive funding from USAID and other agencies sued after they were cut off from federal funding for foreign assistance programs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to reinstate funding for foreign aid contracts and other awards while litigation moves forward, delivering yet another setback for the president as he seeks to make sweeping changes to the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali partially granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of organizations that receive funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, and other agencies, but have since been cut off from federal dollars or had to suspend their work in the wake of Mr. Trump's executive action ordering a 90-day pause on foreign development aid.",
      "The nonprofit organizations argued that Mr. Trump's directive and a subsequent memorandum from Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued late last month, which temporarily stopped new obligations of funding for foreign assistance programs and called for stop-work orders, was an unlawful and unconstitutional exercise of executive power.",
      "They warned that the directive has \"created chaos in the funding and administration\" of USAID and other foreign assistance programs.",
      "\"One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order,\" lawyers for one group of challengers, led by the Global Health Council, wrote in a court filing.",
      "Ali, appointed by former President Joe Biden, blocked top Trump administration officials from enforcing a pause on foreign assistance funded through the State Department or USAID without authorization and halting new obligations of funding for foreign assistance programs pending a review. He also barred the administration from suspending contracts, grants or other foreign assistance awards that were in effect as of Jan. 19 and issuing stop-work orders in connection with foreign aid awards that were in existence before Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "The judge said at the current stage of litigation, the nonprofit organizations met their burden for temporary, emergency relief, but that their request was too broad. But Ali found the groups were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and made a \"strong preliminary showing that they were likely to suffer irreparable harm.\"",
      "\"Here, the stated purpose in implementing the suspension of all foreign aid is to provide the opportunity to review programs for their efficiency and consistency with priorities,\" Ali wrote. \"However, at least to date, Defendants have not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shockwave and upended reliance interests for thousands of agreements with businesses, nonprofits, and organizations around the country, was a rational precursor to reviewing programs.\"",
      "In a hearing held Wednesday, Stephen Wirth, a lawyer representing one group of seven nonprofits, said his clients have been \"devastated\" by Mr. Trump's executive order. He warned that as a result of the freeze on funding for foreign assistance programs, small businesses have been forced to shutter, food for starving populations abroad is rotting in ports and warehouses, and medical supplies are expiring.",
      "Additionally, at least one group, Democracy International, an international development company that conducts projects for USAID, has had to furlough all 95 of its U.S.-based workers and 93% of its employees working on USAID projects in overseas offices, Wirth said.",
      "The federal government, he said, is terminating contracts \"en masse.\"",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofits said that organizations that receive foreign assistance grants have tried to draw down funding from USAID and the State Department, but have not been able to access their funds. In other instances, groups have had contracts terminated and pending invoices for completed work have not been paid, Wirth said.",
      "At least 230 USAID grants and contracts have been terminated or been subject to stop-work orders since Tuesday, Justice Department lawyers said in a filing.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its decision to issue the 90-day pause on U.S. foreign development assistance allows it to ensure that the projects the U.S. is supporting align with the administration's foreign policy.",
      "Eric Hamilton, deputy assistant attorney general, said during the hearing that the issue is about how money that has been appropriated by Congress is being spent. He argued federal laws governing foreign assistance allow the president to determine how those funds should be used.",
      "He also noted that Rubio has approved a waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance programs.",
      "The cases before Ali arose from recent efforts by the Trump administration to overhaul USAID, which was founded in 1961 and is an independent agency. Its operations have been in turmoil over the past few weeks amid the Trump administration's freeze on foreign assistance funding and stop-work orders for USAID contractors and agency partners. The administration also moved to shut down overseas USAID missions and recall thousands of employees living and working abroad. The administration last week\u00a0placed thousands of USAID employees on administrative leave and closed the aid agency's Washington, D.C., headquarters to staff.",
      "But some of Mr. Trump's efforts have been stopped by another federal judge in Washington in a separate case brought by labor unions.",
      "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, appointed by Mr. Trump, temporarily prohibited the government from placing more than 2,000 employees on administrative leave. He also ordered the administration to reinstate employees already on leave and blocked expedited evacuations of USAID employees from their host countries.",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has repeatedly insisted that the House take the lead on the reconciliation process, told reporters Thursday that \"there's a lot of discussion and debate and deliberation ahead of us.\" Still, he called the markup the \"necessary first start to get it going.\"",
      "\"We have a very diverse conference and we have to get everybody onboard,\" the Louisiana Republican said.",
      "What's in the House GOP proposal",
      "House Republicans have been at odds with their Senate colleagues, preferring to pass one major border and defense bill that also includes up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "The House resolution calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts and instructs more than a handful of committees to find ways to reduce the deficit, while increasing spending for several other issue areas.",
      "In a deal with conservatives, the House Budget Committee agreed to amend the budget resolution Thursday to secure the tax cut threshold. Under the agreement, if House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be lower than the proposed $4.5 trillion. But if they slash more than $2 trillion, tax cuts would be increased.",
      "The panels tasked with finding the steepest cuts are the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is instructed to propose at least $880 billion in cuts; the Education and Workforce Committee, with at least $330 billion; and the Agriculture Committee, with a minimum of $230 billion.",
      "The resolution instructs the Judiciary Committee to propose up to $110 billion in additional spending, while the Armed Services Committee could propose $100 billion in new spending. The Homeland Security Committee would be allotted $90 billion.",
      "What's in the Senate GOP plan",
      "On the other side of the Capitol, Senate Republicans have backed a two-bill strategy. The first is focused on border security, defense and energy priorities, while the second would include an extension of the tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "The Senate's first resolution would direct the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland Security Committee to each propose no more than $175 billion in additional spending. The Armed Services Committee could propose $150 billion in new spending, while the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee would be allotted $20 billion and the Environment and Public Works Committee $1 billion.",
      "Several other committees would be instructed to find at least $1 billion in cuts.",
      "The resolution would increase annual spending by $85.5 billion, which would be paid for by the same amount in spending cuts, according to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who leads the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "Graham said Wednesday during debate on the upper chamber's proposal that he's \"pulling for one big, beautiful bill, but there's a sense of urgency\" in approving immigration-related funding.",
      "\"I hope you will consider what we do if you cannot produce the one big, beautiful bill quickly,\" Graham said.",
      "House Freedom Caucus gets onboard",
      "The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative faction that has been a thorn in the side of Republican leaders, unveiled its own two-step plan on Monday as the House faced repeated delays in releasing its package. But Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Thursday that with the amendment in place tying tax cuts to spending cuts, he expects members will support the budget resolution.",
      "GOP Reps. Ralph Norman of South Dakota and Chip Roy of Texas, two House Freedom Caucus members who were seen as potential roadblocks on the budget panel, came out in favor of the proposal during Thursday's hearing.",
      "\"This budget put forward by the chairman is a giant step forward to reduce spending,\" Roy said. \"I believe that it is responsible, and I believe it is a balance of what we're supposed to do.\"",
      "Harris outlined that the agreement will \"allow the flexibility to actually bring the tax cuts even higher\" if there's more spending cuts. In terms of where to find the cuts, Harris wouldn't point to specifics, deferring to the committees on where to find savings.",
      "The House GOP's estimates project an increase of $2.5 trillion in revenues due to economic growth sparked by the trillions in tax cuts. Harris called that a \"conservative\" estimate and said that \"when it all balances out, we believe that \u2026 it's actually going to result in deficit reduction.\"",
      "Asked whether the Freedom Caucus was still planning to release its own tax package, Harris said, \"No, this is it.\"",
      "\"We declare victory,\" Harris said, noting that the group was aiming for meaningful deficit reduction, and the ability to advance Mr. Trump's tax policy. \"We don't need another bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have hammered the Republican blueprints, questioning how the proposals will help everyday Americans struggling with the high cost of living.",
      "\"Republicans in the House and Senate have shown no interest in making life better for everyday Americans, because it's all about tax cuts for the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York told reporters Wednesday. \"The Republicans with their budget have betrayed the middle class.\"",

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 A lawsuit filed on Thursday by attorneys general from 14 states challenges the authority of billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to access sensitive government data and exercise \"virtually unchecked power.\"",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., argues President Trump violated the appointments clause of the Constitution by creating a federal department without congressional approval.",
      "DOGE, which isn't an official government agency, was tasked by Mr. Trump to produce recommendations on trimming federal outlays, with billionaires Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, before he departed, \u00a0saying they\u00a0aimed to cut about $500 billion\u00a0in annual expenditures.",
      "Musk's team has roamed from agency to agency, tapping into computer systems, digging into budgets and searching for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse, while lawsuits pile up claiming Mr. Trump and DOGE are violating the law.",
      "The latest lawsuit details how, according to the state attorneys general, Musk has \"unraveled federal agencies, accessed sensitive data, and caused widespread disruption for state and local governments, federal employees, and the American people.\" It goes on to say DOGE \"endangers cybersecurity and erodes public trust.\"",
      "The New Mexico Department of Justice is leading the lawsuit with Arizona and Michigan as co-leads. Attorneys general from California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington also joined the lawsuit.",
      "They asked the court to order Musk to identify ways that \"any data obtained through unlawful agency access was used,\" destroy \"such unauthorized access in his or DOGE's possession\" and bar Musk and DOGE from ordering changes in the disbursement of public funds, canceling government contracts, taking steps to dismantle agencies and more.",
      "On Thursday, Musk called for the U.S. to \"delete entire agencies\" from the federal government as part of his push to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.",
      "Democratic attorneys general say Musk's approach is generating profound concerns among their constituents about the secure handling of sensitive information at agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the IRS.",
      "\"Donald Trump seems to think a narrow electoral victory makes him into a king. He could not be more wrong,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. \"Worse still, Trump installed Elon Musk at the head of that agency without vetting and Senate confirmation, and Musk has proceeded to use that unconstitutional appointment to try to cut the federal government to the bone.\"",
      "New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said Mr. Trump is demonstrating \"weakness\" in deploying Musk rather than advancing his agenda through a Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "\"Move fast and breaking things may work in Silicon Valley for a tech company,\" Torrez said. \"It's not good governance and it's unconstitutional.\"",
      "The lawsuit seeks a court ruling declaring Musk's actions unconstitutional and wants his previous actions invalidated.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in New York temporarily\u00a0blocked DOGE from accessing Treasury Department records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued the preliminary injunction after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued Mr. Trump.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed a memorandum directing his administration to weigh reciprocal tariffs, threatening to impose levies on U.S. imports from nations that put higher duties on American products.",
      "\"I've decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office at a proclamation signing. \"It's fair to all. No other country can complain.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its tariff policies would level the competitive playing field for U.S. and foreign manufacturers, although the new taxes would probably be shouldered by U.S. shoppers and businesses either directly or indirectly.",
      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again. Consumer prices in January\u00a0accelerated\u00a0to 3% on an annual basis, signaling the Federal Federal's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has petered out, at least for now.",
      "Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note earlier this week that proceeding with reciprocal U.S. tariffs poses \"additional upside risks to the inflation outlook.\"",
      "Trade negotiations",
      "The tariff hikes would vary for affected countries, with a goal of starting new trade negotiations, the Associated Press reported. A senior White House official who spoke to the wire service on condition of anonymity said the reviews required to move forward with the tariffs could be finished within a number of weeks, although the process could take longer.",
      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",
      "President Trump has placed an additional tariff on Chinese imports for what he says is that nation's role in producing opioid fentanyl. He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico that could take effect next month, after being paused 30 days. Mr. Trump also this week announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that are scheduled to take effect in March.",
      "Applying a matching tariff against select U.S. trading partners is likely an alternative to imposing a more sweeping levy, according to economists. Argentina, Brazil, India and Turkey have the biggest gaps in tariffs with the U.S., trade data shows.",
      "\"While most developed markets would come out relatively unscathed, emerging markets would suffer a greater loss of competitiveness, with India, Brazil and Turkey looking among the most exposed,\" Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report. \"It is probable that their governments (among others) would provide concessions to President Trump in an attempt to prevent reciprocal tariffs from being imposed.\"",

He reiterated that point Thursday.",
      "\"Simply pointing out realism like the borders won't be rolled back to what everybody would like them to be in 2014 is not a concession to Vladimir Putin,\" Hegseth said. \"It's a recognition of the hard power realities on the ground after a lot of investment and sacrifice.\"",

      "The Trump administration has pushed more deportation agreements, though it's unclear how many more arrangements will be agreed to. One plan that had been considered would have sent third-country nationals to the South American nation of Guyana, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "Panama's willingness to accept the deportees also comes as Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in retaking control of the strategically important Panama Canal, which the U.S. ceded to Panama in 1999.

    "summary": "The former acting New York U.S. attorney said Adams' attorneys had offered \"what amounted to a quid pro quo\" \u2014 helping the U.S. with immigration enforcement \"in exchange for dismissal of his case.\"",
    "story": [
      "Manhattan's top career federal prosecutor resigned after attorneys in her office were directed to drop their criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, three sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Danielle Sassoon stepped down from her role as acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York on Thursday, days after a top Justice Department official ordered her office to dismiss corruption charges against the mayor.",
      "On Monday, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing prosecutors in Manhattan to abandon the five-count indictment that was filed in September.",
      "\"You are directed, as authorized by the Attorney General, to dismiss the pending charges,\" Bove wrote, adding that the department \"reached this conclusion without assessing the strength of the evidence or the legal theories on which the case is based,\" and \"in no way calls into question the integrity and efforts\" of the prosecutors who brought the case.",
      "Bove also cited Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies, and the case was to be dropped with prejudice, so the charges could be revived at a later time.",
      "In a letter addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi and reviewed by CBS News, Sassoon offered her resignation and said the request to drop Adams' case \"raises serious concerns that render the contemplated dismissal inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.\"",
      "Pushing back on Bove's directive to dismiss the mayor's case, Sassoon wrote she was \"baffled\" by the process and argued the basis behind the orders was not valid. And she alleged Adams was engaging in an \"an improper offer of immigration enforcement assistance in exchange for a dismissal of his case.\"",
      "Sasson's letter to the attorney general alleged that during a meeting with Justice Department officials last month, Adams' attorneys \"urged what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" allegedly offering the mayor's cooperation with Trump administration priorities in exchange for the dismissal of the charges. Bove and Adams' legal team both rejected this assertion.",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with dismissal of a criminal indictment. Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest,\" Sassoon wrote. She also argued Bove's characterization of the timing of the indictment against Adams as politically motivated was wrong.",
      "\"The Department of Justice correctly concluded that bringing charges nine months before a primary election was entirely appropriate,\" Sasson wrote in her letter, which was sent on Wednesday. She added that \"dismissing the case will amplify, rather than abate, concerns about weaponization of the Department.\"",
      "Sassoon wrote that federal prosecutors proposed adding a new charge against Adams, accusing him of allegedly destroying evidence and providing false statements to the FBI. She said those charges were never filed.",
      "Bove sent a strongly worded response to Sassoon Thursday, which was also reviewed by CBS News. He rejected many of Sasson's allegations and accepted her resignation as acting U.S. attorney. He accused her of losing sight of her oath and said that under Sassoon's leadership, \"the office has demonstrated itself to be incapable of fairly and impartially reviewing the circumstances of this prosecution.\"",
      "Bove admonished Sassoon for not following the directive. \"The Justice Department will not tolerate the insubordination and apparent misconduct reflected in the approach that you and your office have taken in this matter.\" He said that he and Justice Department leadership stood by the decision to drop Adams' case and Sassoon's refusal to comply interfered with the \"interests of justice.\"",
      "\"As a result of the pending prosecution, Mayor Adams is unable to communicate directly and candidly with City officials he is responsible for managing, as well as federal agencies trying to protect the public from national security threats and violent crime,\" Bove wrote. \"My directive to you reflected a determination by the Justice Department that these public safety risks greatly outweigh any interest you have identified.\"",
      "The line prosecutors who worked on Adams' case have been placed on paid leave, pending investigations into Sassoon's conduct, Bove's letter also revealed.",
      "In response to Sassoon's new allegations against Adams and his legal team, Alex Spiro, an attorney for the mayor, told CBS News, \"The idea that there was a quid pro quo is a total lie. We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\"",
      "\"We were asked if the case had any bearing on national security and immigration enforcement and we truthfully answered it did,\" Spiro said.",
      "Bove also rejected Sassoon's claims of a quid pro quo, writing, \"You have also strained, unsuccessfully, to suggest that some kind of quid pro quo arises from my directive. This is false, as you acknowledged previously in writing. The Justice Department is charged with keeping people safe across the country. Your office's job is to help keep the City safe. But your actions have endangered it.\"",
      "The acting heads of the Justice Department's criminal and public integrity divisions, Kevin Driscoll and his deputy, John Keller, also recently resigned from their posts at Justice Department headquarters in Washington in the wake of the Adams case, according to three separate people familiar with the moves.",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Bove also cited Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies. The case was to be dropped without prejudice until the mayoral election later this year, pending a review by the U.S. attorney's office. So it's possible the charges could be revived at a later time.",
      "Adams was set to go to trial on the charges \u2014 which included bribery and campaign finance violations \u2014 in April. He pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Despite the Justice Department's order, federal prosecutors in Sassoon's office had not yet complied with the directive on Thursday, a signal of a potential conflict between the office that filed the charges against Adams and the Trump administration's new leadership.",
      "Driscoll and Keller's departures also point to a growing rift within the Justice Department over the handling of the case.",
      "During a press conference on Wednesday, when the Justice Department announced a civil lawsuit against New York State officials, Attorney General Pam Bondi said she was unaware that prosecutors in the Southern District of New York had not yet complied with Bove's order.",
      "Sassoon was appointed interim head of the office while President Trump's pick to be Manhattan's U.S. attorney, Jay Clayton, makes his way through the Ssenate confirmation process.",
      "Sassons's departure came after a number of Biden-appointed U.S. attorneys from across the country were fired from their positions this week, multiple sources confirmed to CBS News. Changes in top federal prosecutor jobs are customary and expected around the time of presidential transitions.",
      "The U.S. attorneys received notes in their inboxes informing them of their terminations, which sources said was a departure from past practice in which they were asked to submit their resignations.",

      "Hochul said she's sent out a notice that certain out-of-state warrants are not enforceable in the state of New York.",
      "Prosecutors in Louisiana said a mother ordered the pill online and gave it to her child, a pregnant minor.",
      "\"The young child was told by the mother that she had to take the pill or else, and the child took the pill,\" \u00a0Baton Rouge, La. District Attorney Tony Clayton previously said. \"To ship a pill from another state is equivalent to me shipping fentanyl or any other type of drugs over here that end up in the mouths and stomachs of our minor kids.\"",

      "The case appears to be the first criminal charges against a doctor accused of sending abortion pills to another state since the\u00a0U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "\"I will never under any circumstances turn this doctor over to the state of Louisiana under any extradition request,\" Hochul previously said\u00a0in a video posted to social media. \"I will do everything I can to protect this doctor and allow her to continue the work that she's doing that is so essential.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A fourth federal judge on Thursday blocked President Trump's executive order seeking to terminate birthright citizenship, joining the growing number of courts that have prevented the president from implementing his directive while a slew of legal challenges continue.",
      "U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin, who sits on the federal district court in Massachusetts, said that a group of 19 states and the District of Columbia, as well as two nonprofit organizations, are likely to prevail on the merits of their claims. The challengers have argued that Mr. Trump's executive order, issued on his first day in office, violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"The Constitution confers birthright citizenship broadly, including to persons within the categories described in the EO,\" Sorokin, appointed by former President Barack Obama, wrote in a 31-page decision.",
      "Sorokin joins federal judges in Maryland, Washington and New Hampshire that have issued preliminary injunctions blocking the Trump administration from enforcing the birthright citizenship executive order. The Justice Department has appealed two of those decisions to federal appeals courts in San Francisco and Richmond, Virginia.",
      "Matthew Platkin, attorney general of New Jersey, which is leading the case, cheered the decision and said the states' coalition delivered for children who could be impacted by Mr. Trump's order.",
      "\"President Trump may believe that he is above the law, but today's preliminary injunction sends a clear message: He is not a king, and he cannot rewrite the Constitution with the stroke of a pen,\" Platkin said in a statement.",
      "At least eight lawsuits have been filed in courts from coast to coast that challenge Mr. Trump's directive. His executive order came as part of an immigration crackdown\u00a0that he promised on the campaign trail. It denies U.S. citizenship to children born to mothers who are in the country unlawfully or temporarily on visas, and whose fathers are neither citizens nor lawful residents.",
      "The decisions from the federal judges against the Trump administration rely on an 1898 Supreme Court decision, United States v. Wong Kim Ark, in which the court held that a man born in the U.S. to Chinese immigrants was a citizen by virtue of the Constitution.",
      "Sorokin, too, pointed to that 127-year-old decision, writing in his opinion that it \"leaves no room\" for the Trump administration's proposed reading of the Constitution's Citizenship Clause.",
      "He noted that the administration can seek to revisit that case, but that would be a matter for the Supreme Court.",
      "\"The rule and reasoning from that decision were reiterated and applied in later decisions, adopted by Congress as a matter of federal statutory law in 1940, and followed consistently by the Executive Branch for the past 100 years, at least,\" Sorokin wrote.",
      "Sorokin was considering the two requests for preliminary injunctions brought by the states, the nonprofit organizations and a pregnant woman whose baby is due in March. The woman, identified in court filings as O. Doe, lives in Massachusetts and plans to be in the U.S. when she gives birth. The woman is in the country with temporary protected status and the baby's father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, according to court filings.",
      "Pointing to the nonprofits and expectant mother, Sorokin said that what is at stake \"is a bedrock constitutional guarantee and all of its attendant privileges. The loss of birthright citizenship \u2014 even if temporary, and later restored at the conclusion of litigation \u2014 has cascading effects that would cut across a young child's life (and the life of that child's family), very likely leaving permanent scars.\"",

      "What is an inspector general?",
      "On October 12, 1978, Congress passed the Inspector General Act, which established twelve Federal Offices of Inspector General tasked with rooting out fraud and waste and providing non-partisan recommendations at government agencies. There are now more than 70 statutory inspectors general\u00a0appointed either by the president or by agency heads.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, following weeks of questions surrounding whether the controversial nominee would win the Senate's approval.",
      "Senators voted 52 to 48 to confirm Kennedy. The vote fell largely along party lines, with one Republican \u2014 Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky \u2014 joining Democrats in opposing him. McConnell, a survivor of childhood polio, said in a statement that Kennedy \"failed to prove he is the best possible person\" for the post, while citing his record on vaccines.",
      "Kennedy was sworn in to the role by Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch during a ceremony at the White House later in the day.",
      "Kennedy, 71, is a longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist whose family has mythic status in Democratic politics. The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and the son of Robert F. Kennedy launched his own White House bid in 2023. And although he initially sought the Democratic nomination, Kennedy changed his bid to independent, before dropping out to endorse President Trump in August.",
      "Before entering politics, Kennedy worked for two decades as president of the Waterkeeper Alliance, a nonprofit. He also founded Children's Health Defense, which has launched legal challenges against vaccine requirements and approvals, and served as its chairman beginning in 2016. Kennedy is married to actor Cheryl Hines. He has six children.",
      "With his confirmation, Kennedy will be at the helm of the sprawling HHS department, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "RFK Jr.'s path to confirmation",
      "After Mr. Trump picked Kennedy for HHS secretary, pledging on the campaign trail to let him \"go wild\" on issues relating to health, food and medicine, Kennedy's confirmation initially appeared to be on shaky ground. With controversial stances on vaccines and abortion, Kennedy garnered opposition from both sides of the aisle. Then, a pair of\u00a0confirmation hearings featuring tense exchanges with several senators did little to quiet concerns about his path to confirmation, with little wiggle room among Republicans to advance his nomination out of committee.",
      "As it became clear Kennedy would not find support among Democrats on the committee, the vote to advance his nomination came down to a single Republican \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2014 whose vote would tip the scale in either direction. Cassidy, a medical doctor, had expressed consternation over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades.",
      "In a surprise move moments ahead of the committee vote, however, Cassidy said he would support Kennedy, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from administration. He later said Kennedy and the administration had agreed \"that he and I would have an unprecedentedly close collaborative working relationship,\" speaking multiple times a month.",
      "\"He will be the secretary, but I believe he will also be a partner,\" Cassidy said.",
      "After Kennedy's nomination advanced out of committee, Republican opposition in the full Senate also appeared to dissipate. Two senators who are among the few Republicans who have voted to oppose any of the president's nominees, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, announced they would support Kennedy's confirmation this week. And on Wednesday, all Republicans voted to advance his nomination in a procedural vote that fell along party lines.",
      "The final vote to confirm Kennedy as HHS secretary came after weeks of pushback by Democrats, who warned of the widespread impact Kennedy could have on the health system. Senate Democrats spent hours on the Senate floor vocalizing their opposition to his confirmation Wednesday.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which was the committee that voted on advancing Kennedy's nomination, called him an \"anti-vaccine crusader\" and the \"least qualified nominee to ever be nominated for a position of this importance.\"",
      "\"Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle still have an opportunity to turn away from a dangerous path,\" Wyden said on Wednesday. \"If they do not, my view is their legacy will be tarnished by setbacks in science that will echo in America for decades.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the vote Thursday morning that he's \"proud\" that every Democrat will oppose Kennedy's nomination, arguing that if the Senate held a vote on Kennedy under a secret ballot, \"Mr. Kennedy would never come close to becoming confirmed.\"",
      "\"Many if not most Republicans would vote against him,\" Schumer continued. \"But sadly and unfortunately for America, Republicans are being strong-armed by Donald Trump and will end up holding their nose and voting to confirm Mr. Kennedy.\"",
      "In his statement explaining why he voted against Kennedy, McConnell cited his history with polio, saying that in his lifetime he's \"watched vaccines save millions of lives from devastating diseases across America and around the world.\" The former GOP leader added that he \"will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures.\"",
      "\"Individuals, parents, and families have a right to push for a healthier nation and demand the best possible scientific guidance on preventing and treating illness,\" McConnell said. \"But a record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts.\"",
      "During his opening statement to the Senate Finance Committee last month, Kennedy said that \"Americans' overall health is in a grievous condition,\" citing high obesity, diabetes and cancer rates, among other conditions on the rise, while pledging to deliver on his and Mr. Trump's promise to \"make America healthy again.\"",
      "\"I promised President Trump that if confirmed I will do everything in my power to put the health of Americans back on track,\" Kennedy said.",

      "\"I love Minnesota and my intention is to run for United States Senate and continue to serve the people of this state,\" Flanagan said. \"I'll make a formal announcement later this month. In the meantime, I'm talking with community and my family and friends. I will have more to say soon.\"",
      "Flanagan is the country's highest ranking Native woman elected to executive office. A member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, she would have become the first Native American woman to become a U.S. governor if the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket won in the presidential election.",
      "After a stint serving on the Minneapolis Board of Education, Flanagan started working for the progressive group Wellstone Action, training organizers, elected officials and candidates with dreams of taking office. She even trained Walz, who before his political career was a high school social studies teacher.",
      "When Walz made his first gubernatorial run in 2018, he tapped Flanagan, who gave his candidacy a liberal tilt.",
      "Since taking office, Flanagan helped establish the country's first\u00a0Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office\u00a0and has worked to make childcare and\u00a0housing\u00a0more affordable. She is a vocal supporter of abortion rights.",
      "Flanagan shouldered more responsibility as Walz hit the campaign trail last fall.\u00a0In a recent interview with WCCO, Walz praised Flanagan for her work as second-in-command but did not confirm if she would be joining him if he were to run for a third term.",
      "\"Lt. Gov. Flanagan has been a voice for children. She has been a voice to make sure our communities are represented. She's been a voice on looking to make sure our tribal communities are listened to,\" Walz said. \"I think she \u2014 she and I together \u2014 have been highly successful, and when we get to that bridge, we'll cross it.\"",
      "After Smith made her announcement Thursday, Flanagan released a statement saying that the senator \"has paved the way for so many women like me throughout her entire career.\"",
      "\"She uses her voice to fiercely defend the people of Minnesota. She's fought for small businesses, farmers, and those who've been overlooked so they can have a fair shot at economic success. Senator Smith is also an organizer at heart. She knows we all do better when everyone has a seat at the table. Thank you, Tina, for your leadership. I look forward to continuing our work together for Minnesotans,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Linda McMahon, President Trump's nominee to become secretary of education, appeared before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on Thursday as the future of the agency that she could potentially lead hangs in the balance.",
      "\"I would like to thank President Trump for his confidence in me to lead a department whose mission and authority were a special focus of his campaign,\" McMahon told the committee. \"He pledged to make American education the best in the world, return education to the states where it belongs, and free American students from the education bureaucracy through school choice.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has long teased the possibility of closing the Department of Education, and he could be closer to making good on his pledge. Since taking office, the president has signed several\u00a0education-related executive orders\u00a0and multiple sources confirm he is\u00a0considering executive action\u00a0that would essentially dismantle the agency. This week, Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, slashed nearly $1 billion in funding from the department and terminated dozens of contracts and grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "\"Oh, I'd like it to be closed immediately,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. \"Look, the Department of Education is a big con job.\"",
      "Under questioning from independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the committee's ranking member, McMahon said the department could not be shut down without congressional action.",
      "\"It is set up by the United States Congress, and we work with Congress,\" she said. \"It clearly cannot be shut down without it.\"",
      "Ahead of her testimony, McMahon met with at least 19 senators, from GOP leadership to members of the HELP committee, including Chair Bill Cassidy, who said the pair had a \"productive\" discussion.",
      "\"She is prepared to return power to parents and reform an Education Department that has lost the plot over the last 4 years of the Biden administration,\" Cassidy posted on X.",
      "Sanders joined union members from the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers who rallied against McMahon's nomination outside of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday.",
      "\"We understand that public education is the backbone of American democracy where all of our people come together to learn and to grow,\" Sanders told the crowd. \"Our job is not to destroy public education, it is to significantly improve it!\"",
      "Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent a letter to McMahon questioning her experience and policy views.",
      "\"You have a minimal track record on education issues and strikingly little experience pertaining to education policy,\" the senators wrote. \"This lack of a public record means that the American people have not been afforded the opportunity to evaluate your views on topics related to the Education Secretary's core responsibilities.\"",
      "McMahon, the former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO who served as administrator of the Small Business Administration during Mr. Trump's first term, has said she is \"committed\" to ensuring students have access to quality education.",
      "\"I look forward to working collaboratively with students \u2014   educators \u2014  parents and communities to strengthen our education system; ensuring every child regardless of their demographics is prepared for a bright future,\" McMahon said in a statement after she was nominated by Mr. Trump last November.",
      "Congressional Democrats have seized on Mr. Trump's threats to eliminate the Education Department, as some House members were physically locked out of the agency's Washington, D.C., headquarters when they attempted to meet with Acting Education Secretary Denise Carter last week. Layoffs at the department began on Wednesday.",
      "\"It's important for us to allow the Department of Education to continue to do its work,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during a weekly news conference. \"That's the heart, soul and spirit of America.\u00a0 For the life of me, I can't understand why Republicans want to abolish the Department of Education. It's baffling to me. It's baffling to the American people, and we will continue to defend our public schools.\"",
      "Even if Mr. Trump moves forward with an executive order, legal and education experts say congressional action would be needed to fully eliminate the Department of Education.",
      "Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota introduced legislation last year that outlines a road map to abolish the Education Department and return control to the states. It would also redirect other federal agencies to oversee certain functions such as Pell grants and special education.",
      "Shortly after Republicans took control of both chambers in January, Republican Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky introduced a one-sentence bill to terminate the agency by the end of 2026. Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, has introduced a countermeasure to protect the Department of Education.",
      "\"We will not take away opportunity for so many children,\" Hayes said. \"We will not eliminate Pell grants and all the programs that help people from low-income communities to go to college.\"",
      "\"I think, as the American people begin to understand, 'Oh, wait a minute, I didn't realize that's what this meant,' and that's across all the departments, I think that there's going to be public outcry and pushback,\" Hayes added, referencing Mr. Trump's desired cuts to the federal government.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson has declared \"the time has come\" to disband the Education Department and said Congress should codify the president's executive order, if enacted.",
      "\"We believe in the core principle that education is best handled by the people closest to the kids,\" Johnson explained. \"What does that mean? It means local school districts, local school boards. It means at the state level rather than the federal level. We think you empower parents when you do that. We give them more choice when you do that. So that's why we're advocates for school choice. That's why we're advocates for charter schools and innovative ideas. And I think you can return American education to a place of prominence and success if you allow those things to happen.\"",
      "President Jimmy Carter signed legislation in 1979 establishing the Department of Education. Federal funding accounts for less than 10% of the nation's public school funding, which is mostly financed through state and local taxes. The agency, tasked with fostering student achievement, also administers programs for disadvantaged students and those with special needs, enforces non-discrimination policies in schools and supports federal college loan programs.",

      "Huitema recalled that the Office of Government Ethics was created by Congress after the Watergate scandal led to President Richard Nixon's resignation. He said it was designed \"to take a nonpartisan, non-politicized, matter-of-fact, by-the-book approach and be that voice of integrity where it's needed.\"",

That's included sidelining career officials, gaining access to sensitive databases and inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",
      "Musk's new role gave his comments more weight beyond being the world's wealthiest person through his investments in SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla.",
      "His remarks also offered a more-isolationist view of American power in the Middle East, where the U.S. has fought wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",

    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

    "story": [
      "New images captured by NASA's Curiosity rover show colorful clouds in the sky over Mars.",
      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",
      "The rover will continue on to a new location that includes what NASA called \"boxwork,\" or fractures in the planet's surface formed by groundwater. When seen from space, the fractures look like giant spiderwebs, NASA said.",

    "summary": "By switching the next space station crew to a different ferry ship, the Starliner astronauts will get home a bit earlier than planned.",
    "story": [
      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space. He said he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams. Musk also blamed Biden in a post on X.",
      "But the Biden administration had no known influence on NASA's decision to extend the Starliner crew's mission, a plan that has been in place since last September when the Crew 9 spacecraft was launched with a two-man crew and two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "And in any case, there was no need to \"go get\" the astronauts given the Crew 9 spacecraft, the Starliner crew's ride home, has been docked at the space station for the past five months.",

      "Flagstaff, Arizona \u2014 Scientists have long suspected that Mexican long-nosed bats migrate through southeastern Arizona, but without capturing and measuring the night-flying creatures, proof has been elusive.",
      "Researchers say they now have a way to tell the endangered species apart from other bats by analyzing saliva the nocturnal mammals leave behind when sipping nectar from plants and residential hummingbird feeders.",
      "Bat Conservation International, a nonprofit group working to end the extinction of bat species worldwide, teamed up with residents from southeastern Arizona, southwestern New Mexico and west Texas for the saliva swabbing campaign.",
      "The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA - or eDNA - to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home.",
      "The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988 and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It's an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated.",
      "\"If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you're not guaranteed to be successful,\" said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. \"By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.\"",
      "Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall.",
      "The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall.",
      "Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge.",
      "Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months.",
      "\"There's a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what's in the database,\" Riley said. \"A little bit like a Google search - you've got your question, you're asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you've got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.\"",
      "Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats.",
      "\"They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,\" Lear said."

      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",

      "\"It wouldn't be something like the rock that killed the dinosaurs,\" Harwood said. \"It wouldn't affect the global climate, but it would certainly be a disaster of every proportion. So we're all hoping that doesn't happen.\"",
      "Scientists aren't panicking yet, but they are watching closely.",
      "\"At this point, it's 'Let's pay a lot of attention, let's get as many assets as we can observing it,'\" Bruce Betts, chief scientist of The Planetary Society, told the AFP news agency.",
      "What we know about 2024 YR4 and its chances of hitting Earth",
      "Dubbed 2024 YR4, the asteroid was first spotted on December 27, 2024, by the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Based on its brightness, astronomers estimate it is between 130 and 300 feet wide.",
      "\"An asteroid this size impacts Earth on average every few thousand years and could cause severe damage to a local region,\" the European Space Agency said in a statement.",
      "By New Year's Eve, it had landed on the desk of Kelly Fast, acting planetary defense officer at US space agency NASA, as an object of concern.",
      "\"You get observations, they drop off again. This one looked like it had the potential to stick around,\" she told AFP.",
      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",
      "According to the latest calculations from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, there is a 1.6% chance the asteroid will strike Earth on December 22, 2032.",
      "The asteroid 2024 YR4 is now rated at Level 3 out of 10 on the\u00a0Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is \"a close encounter\" that warrants attention from astronomers and the public.",
      "If it does hit, possible impact sites include over the eastern Pacific Ocean, northern South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, the Arabian Sea, and South Asia, the IAWN memo states.",
      "2024 YR4 follows a highly elliptical, four-year orbit, swinging through the inner planets before shooting past Mars and out toward Jupiter.",
      "For now, it's zooming away from Earth, and its next close pass will not come until 2028. Scientists will be able to get another look at the asteroid then, Harwood said, and determine its orbit and trajectory.",
      "Betts said, \"The odds are very good that not only will this not hit Earth, but at some point in the next months to few years, that probability will go to zero.\"",
      "A similar scenario unfolded in 2004 with Apophis, an asteroid initially projected to have a 2.7 percent chance of striking Earth in 2029. Further observations ruled out an impact.",
      "\"City killer\" category",
      "The most infamous asteroid impact occurred 66 million years ago, when a six-mile-wide space rock triggered a global winter, wiping out the dinosaurs and 75 percent of all species.",
      "By contrast, 2024 YR4 falls into the \"city killer\" category.",
      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",
      "If it explodes over the ocean, the impact would be less concerning, unless it happens near a coastline triggering a tsunami.",
      "Time to prepare",
      "The good news, experts stress, is that we have plenty of time to prepare.",
      "Rivkin led the investigation for NASA's 2022 DART mission, which successfully nudged an asteroid off its course using a spacecraft \u2014 a strategy known as a \"kinetic impactor.\"",
      "The target asteroid posed no threat to Earth, making it an ideal test subject.",
      "\"I don't see why it wouldn't work\" again, he said. The bigger question is whether major nations would fund such a mission if their own territory was not under threat.",
      "Other, more experimental ideas exist.",
      "Lasers could vaporize part of the asteroid to create a thrust effect, pushing it off course. A \"gravity tractor,\" a large spacecraft that slowly tugs the asteroid away using its own gravitational pull, has also been theorized.",
      "If all else fails, the long warning time means authorities could evacuate the impact zone.",
      "\"Nobody should be scared about this,\" said Fast. \"We can find these things, make these predictions and have the ability to plan.\"",
      "Still, NASA tracks close approaches and calculates the odds of those space rocks \u2014 including asteroids, meteors and meteorites \u2014 impacting Earth.",
      "\"The majority of near-Earth objects have orbits that don't bring them very close to Earth, and therefore pose no risk of impact, but a small fraction of them \u2013 called potentially hazardous asteroids \u2013 require more attention,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0the website of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which manages the center dedicated to studying near-Earth objects for NASA.",

      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",
      "It also visited an impact crater nicknamed \"Rustic Canyon\" to take photos and study the rocks around the crater. The 67-foot wide crater likely formed millions of years ago, based on the erosion of the site, NASA said.",

      "The space rock is formally named 2024 YR4. Scientists say it currently carries a 2% risk of making contact with Earth when it eventually reaches this part of the solar system on Dec. 22, 2032. Although the asteroid will most likely pass by without issue, those tasked with monitoring its physical attributes and potential have shifted upward the probability of a crash since 2024 YR4 was initially discovered.",
      "The European Space Agency in January placed the asteroid's odds of hitting Earth at roughly 1%, before NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory estimated the risk was more like 1.6% at the tail end of the month. Officials at both agencies acknowledge the unlikelihood of 2024 YR4 causing problems, with the ESA saying that current risk estimates are probably unnecessarily high because the people studying it are still uncertain about some of the asteroid's key features.",
      "Right now, astronomers estimate the asteroid is between 40 meters and 90 meters wide, which is roughly 130 to 295 feet wide. For reference, an American football field measures 100 yards \u2014 or 300 feet \u2014 long.",
      "\"It is very important that we improve our size estimate for 2024 YR4,\" the ESA said in a statement Monday, which noted \"the hazard represented by a 40 m asteroid is very different from that of a 90 m asteroid.\"",
      "On the slim chance the asteroid does strike Earth in 2032, its impacts would be localized. But 2024 YR4 has nonetheless received a Level 3 rating, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which is a fairly rare distinction meant to represent \"a close encounter\" that warrants public and scientific attention.",

      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",

      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space.

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 11:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "In his first international address, Vice President JD Vance also argued AI must remain free from \"ideological bias.\"",
    "story": [
      "Paris, France\u00a0\u2014 Vice President JD Vance, in his first international address, warned European Union countries against overregulation and said the Trump administration wants artificial intelligence to remain free from ideological bias.",
      "\"The Trump administration is troubled by reports that some foreign governments are considering tightening the screws on U.S. tech companies with international footprints,\" Vance said while speaking to world leaders and tech executives at the Artificial Intelligence Action summit in Paris, France. \"Now, America cannot and will not accept that, and we think it's a terrible mistake \u2014 not just for the United States of America \u2014 but for your own countries.\"",
      "Vance said the U.S. wants to ensure that the internet is a safe place, but suggested the European Union's Digital Services Act had gone too far, enacting \"massive regulations\" and \"policing so-called misinformation.\"",
      "\"It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,\" Vance said.",
      "The Digital Services Act seeks to hold platforms more accountable for protecting European users from harmful or illegal content on their sites and imposes fines on violators. Last July, the EU found that the social media platform X, owned by Department of Government Effficiency head and Trump ally Elon Musk, did not comply with the act's transparency or accountability requirements.",
      "Vance told leaders, including European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, that excessive regulation of the AI sector could \"kill a transformative industry just as it's taking off\" and the Trump administration will make it a priority to promote pro-growth AI policies.",
      "\"I'd like to see that deregulatory flavor making its way into a lot of the conversations at this conference,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance promoted America-first AI policies during his address, echoing a push by French President Emmanuel Macron for the EU to embrace a deregulatory environment to encourage more AI development on the continent.",
      "Macron said Monday that France generates enough clean electric power to build artificial intelligence centers, which require massive amounts of energy.",
      "\"I have a good friend on the other part of the ocean saying 'drill, baby, drill,'\" Macron said, in reference to President Trump and his push for fossil fuel energy. \"Here, there is no need to 'drill, baby, drill.' It is just 'plug, baby, plug.'\"",
      "Though the intent of the summit, which Macron is co-hosting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was to establish standards for more sustainable AI in the public interest, it has been overshadowed by the race between global powers to become the dominant country in the sector.",
      "Major American tech CEOs Google's Sundar Pichai and OpenAI's Sam Altman are attending the summit, as well as world leaders, including Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing.",
      "Vance said the Trump administration would ensure that the U.S. continues to be the partner of choice for foreign countries and businesses in developing AI.",
      "While the vice president did not mention China \u2014 or its new AI company DeepSeek \u2014 he put \"hostile foreign adversaries\" who have \"weaponized A.I. software to rewrite history, surveil users, and censor speech\" on notice.",
      "\"I want to be clear: this administration will block such efforts, full stop,\" Vance said. \"We will safeguard American A.I. and chip technologies from theft and misuse, work with our allies and partners to strengthen and extend these protections and close pathways to advert areas attaining A.I. capabilities that threaten all of our people.\"",
      "He extended the warning to allies as well.",
      "\"I would also remind our international friends here today that partnering with such regimes, it never pays off in the long term. From CCTV to 5G equipment, we're all familiar with cheap tech in the marketplace that's been heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes,\" Mr. Vance said.",

    "summary": "After seeing a freshly dug hole while conditioning a horse, the equestrian found out later it was used to bury 17-year-old Justine Vanderschoot.",
    "story": [
      "It was Labor Day weekend 2003 when Matt Scribner, a local horse farrier and trainer who also competes in long-distance horse races, was on his usual ride in a remote part of the Sierra Nevada foothills \u2014 just a few miles northeast of Auburn, California \u2014when he noticed a freshly dug hole along the trail that piqued his curiosity.",
      "\"48 Hours\" contributor Natalie Morales revisited the site on horseback with Scribner, who told her, \"The rest of my ride, I kept trying to justify why [the hole] was there.\"",
      "\"It sort of haunted you, it sounds like,\" said Morales.",
      "\"It did,\" Scribner agreed. And it would haunt him for years to come as Scribner tells Morales in\u00a0\"Justine's Voice,\"\u00a0an all-new \"48 Hours\" airing Saturday, Feb. 15 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Scribner had returned with his horse to ride the same trail a week later. He saw a search team gathering at the park and ride nearby. Like everyone in the community, Scribner was aware that local teen Justine Vanderschoot had been missing. As he rode past the area where he had seen the freshly dug hole, he now saw a mattress. Scribner says he didn't suspect anything since the area was used as a dumping ground of sorts. It would be another week-and-a-half before he would realize he was a key witness in a murder case, when the local paper reported that Justine's remains had been found, and her boyfriend, Danny Bezemer, and his roommate, Brandon Fernandez, had been arrested and charged with her murder.",
      "\"The Auburn Journal had a photo of just the brush ... where Justine had been buried,\" Scribner said. \"I went, 'Oh my gosh.'\u00a0 ... I saw the freshly dug hole three days prior to her disappearance. ... I immediately ... contacted the [Placer County] sheriff's department.\"",
      "Retired Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner told \"48 Hours,\" \"That was a big piece of evidence ... that's absolutely coldblooded, premeditated.\"",
      "Justine's parents, Don and Lynnette Vanderschoot, had reported her missing on Sept. 2, 2003, after Lynnette had awoken in the early morning hours to find that Justine wasn't in her bedroom and her truck, normally parked in the driveway, was gone. They reached out to their community for help finding her, but more than two weeks passed with no sign of Justine.",
      "\"It felt sinister,\" Bonner told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sheriff's detectives spoke with people within Justine's inner circle, and quickly zeroed in on Bezemer and Fernandez. Bezemer was known to be jealous and possessive, and, according to Justine's friends, he believed she was cheating on him.",
      "\"There is a belief right away,\" Bonner said, \"that [Bezemer and Fernandez] are concealing something about Justine's disappearance. ... We needed to separate them, number one, but to have one roll on the other.\"",
      "Placer County Sheriff's detectives enlisted the help of the FBI. On Sept. 17, 2003, FBI agent Jeff Rinek and his partner Chris Hopkins interviewed Fernandez at the FBI building in Sacramento while Bezemer was questioned by detectives at sheriff's headquarters.",
      "Rinek \u2014 who had earned a reputation for eliciting confessions, particularly in cases involving children \u2014 asked Fernandez a key question: \"Have you ever seen anyone die, Brandon?\" Under pressure, Fernandez confessed and led investigators to Justine's grave \u2014 the same spot where Scribner had seen the hole freshly dug, then covered up. Fernandez said Bezemer had strangled Justine and made him help bury her. Her autopsy would later indicate she was still breathing when she was buried.",
      "Bezemer admitted to detectives he strangled Justine, but alleged Fernandez was the mastermind. Placer County District Attorney Morgan Gire told Morales, \"Brandon does a pretty good job incriminating Danny, and Danny does a pretty good job of incriminating Brandon.\"",
      "Taking into consideration Justine's family's wishes to avoid a painful, prolonged trial, both men were offered plea deals. In 2005, Bezemer pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and received a sentence of 25 years to life, while Fernandez pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for a sentence of 15 years to life.",
      "But after a 2018 change to the law of murder in California, Fernandez petitioned to have his murder conviction thrown out. The new law reduced the culpability of defendants who didn't actually do the killing and didn't intend for anyone to die, like a getaway driver in a robbery gone wrong. Fernandez asked to be resentenced as an accessory after the fact. His defense attorney Steve Defilippis told \"48 Hours\" his client is not guilty of Justine's murder and insists Bezemer threatened him into helping him after the fact.",
      "\"Clearly Brandon was ... in the wrong,\" Defilippis said. \"He shouldn't have participated in the cover-up of this, and that's what he did.\"",
      "Both sides would have to present their case in an evidentiary hearing in May 2024. If Fernandez's petition is granted, he would be released on time served \u2014 a terrifying thought for the Vanderschoots, who say he is still dangerous.",
      "\"He still has not taken any responsibility,\" Lynette said. \"He's guilty just as much as Danny.\"",
      "\"We're fighting for her, Justine's sister, Christine, told Morales. \"She doesn't have a voice, so we're her voice.\"",

Tyson Scofield, commanding officer of the Coast Guard Cutter Waesche, in a news release announcing the haul. \"Their dedication, strength of character, and resilience ensured the success of our mission, preventing over $275 million worth of illicit narcotics from reaching the United States and protecting our communities from the devastating effects of transnational crime.\"",
      "While operating, a crew member identified by the Coast Guard as Seaman Bryan K. Lee was reported as unaccounted for on Tuesday, Feb. 4, the week before the ship arrived in San Diego. The Waesche crew and other responding assets, including multiple Air Force aircraft, two Mexican navy vessels and an unmanned drone, searched more than 19,000 square nautical miles for a combined nearly 190 hours before the the search was suspended on Saturday, Feb. 8.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 09:14:30 -0500",
    "summary": "The federal government is the nation's largest employer, yet the size of its workforce hasn't kept up with U.S. population growth, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is moving swiftly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 a move that he has said will slash wasteful spending and make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's dictates.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the federal government as \"bloated\" and filled with \"people that are unnecessary.\" While the federal government has inefficiencies, as do all large and complex organizations, some experts are pointing out that the government workforce has grown little since 1980, and that some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration and the FAA's air traffic control centers.",
      "\"There's no indication that the government is particularly bloated in terms of numbers of federal workers \u2014 that number hasn't really changed over the past decades,\" Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The problem we were facing over the past decades isn't one of bloat, but of vacancies.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees\u00a0\u2014 who generally have less than a year on the job and who aren't yet covered by civil service protections \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "As Mr. Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency push to slash spending, here's what to know about the nation's federal workforce and the potential impact on Americans of scaling back government.",
      "What are Trump and Musk doing to shrink the federal workforce?",
      "Working with billionaire Elon Musk, Mr. Trump has offered a \"deferred resignation\" plan to more than 2 million federal employees, that would grant pay through the end of September while not working, in exchange for agreeing to step down. A federal judge on Tuesday cleared the program to proceed after it had been paused.",
      "About 75,000 workers have accepted the offer, and the Trump administration said that the deferred resignation program was closed as of 7 p.m. Feb. 12. The offer excludes members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security.",
      "In another move aimed at remaking the federal workforce, Mr. Trump this week also signed an executive order to reduce the number of government employees and limit hiring.",
      "The administration's order on Thursday to cut probationary workers is expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. According to federal data, there are about 220,000 federal workers with less than a year on the job, representing about 9% of the government workforce.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Is the federal workforce growing?",
      "As Mr. Trump and Musk charge ahead, some policy experts note that the federal workforce has decreased relative to the U.S. population when compared with earlier decades. The upshot: There are fewer government workers providing services to more U.S. residents than in prior years, according to new research from the Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "The federal workforce has waxed and waned over the years, but its size today puts it on the same footing as during the 1980s, when the U.S. population was about 220 million. Today, there are more than 330 million U.S. residents.",
      "How big is the federal workforce?",
      "The U.S. has more than 2.4 million federal workers, excluding those who work for the U.S. Postal Service, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (As a self-funded agency, the USPS relies on sales of stamps and other products and services to support its operations.)",
      "\"In absolute terms, the federal workforce is slightly smaller than it was 50 years ago, even though the U.S. population has increased by two-thirds during that time period,\" noted Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "In the 1940s, the federal workforce represented 4.5% of non-farm workers, a share that's dwindled to 1.5% today, according to CEPR's analysis.",
      "How efficient is the federal workforce?",
      "There's no overarching measure of the efficiency of the federal workforce, Linos of Harvard's Kennedy School noted. But agencies typically review their own operations to identify gaps that affect their ability to provide services.",
      "The federal workforce's efficiency should be measured on whether agencies are delivering the services they've been tasked to handle, she added. In recent years, many agencies have added data-driven measurements to determine whether they are providing those services to Americans.",
      "For instance, the Social Security Administration's most recent annual performance report identified long wait times for callers as a trouble spot, and added that it would like to shave the hold times to 12 minutes on average from its 34 minute on-hold time for fiscal year 2024. But that \"aspirational goal\" was being evaluated amid a hiring freeze, the report added.",
      "The Social Security Administration, which last year served a record 68 million beneficiaries, is working with its smallest staff in 50 years, former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in November congressional testimony.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. government suffers from various types of inefficiencies, with a 2024 U.S. Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0estimating that as much as $521 billion annually is lost to fraud, or about 8% of federal spending.",
      "Federal spending also has ballooned in recent years, although much of the increase is due to higher spending on Social Security and paying interest on federal debt,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "What agencies have the most federal workers?",
      "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has the most federal workers, with more than 487,000 employees, according to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. That's followed by the Department of Homeland Security, with more than 222,000 workers; and the U.S. Army, with 221,000 employees.",
      "Some of the agencies that have been targeted by Mr. Trump are relatively small by comparison. For instance, the president is considering an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, which has about 4,200 employees.",
      "Where are federal workers based geographically?",
      "Only about 7% of federal workers are located in Washington, D.C., proper, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. But when adding the federal workers located in Virginia and Maryland, the larger Washington, D.C., metro area represents about 20% of the entire government workforce.",
      "Roughly 80% of federal workers are located outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and civil service employees are employed in every U.S. state, the CRS report noted.",
      "While Washington, D.C., proper has the largest number of federal workers, at about 162,000, other states aren't far behind: California employs about 147,000 federal workers, while Texas has about 130,000.",
      "Additional states with sizable federal workforces include Florida, at about 94,000, and Georgia, with almost 80,000 federal workers, the analysis found.",
      "What does the typical federal worker earn?",
      "The average annual salary of federal workers tops $106,000, Pew Research Center found, citing OPM data.",
      "Federal salaries skew into the six figures because many civil service workers hold college or professional degrees, and are highly trained. The largest share of federal workers are employed in the medical field \u2014 physicians and nurses who work for the VA, for instance.",
      "Others are professionals such as accountants and attorneys who might be able to earn more if they worked for private employers. For instance, the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts and other derivatives, pays its employees an average of $235,910. About 40% of its workforce is comprised of attorneys, Pew found.",
      "How could a much smaller federal workforce affect Americans?",
      "Services could degrade if enough federal workers are cut or resign, Harvard's Linos said. But Americans would still expect a certain level of service, such as getting their benefits paid on time or getting a passport on a timely basis.",
      "To address that issue, the federal government could turn to private-sector contractors to pick up the slack, she added. \"That's more costly \u2014 you end up paying a higher wage to private sector workers with less accountability,\" she noted.",
      "A hit to public services could heighten negative public sentiment about the federal government, Linos added. Public trust in the federal government has declined for decades, falling from about 77% of people in the 1960s who trust the government to do what is right to about 22% today, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\"We tell people the government is bloated, the day-to-day experience gets worse, and that feeds the narrative that the government is useless,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Valentine's cards and gifts have their roots in English traditions \u2014 but Americans have long embraced them for romantic partners and other loved ones.",
    "story": [
      "The history of Valentine's Day is mushy.",
      "It's been linked to a 12th-century poem about birds mating, the Christian-martyr-turned-Saint Valentine and a deadly fertility ritual in ancient Rome, but Elizabeth Nelson, an associate professor of history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, thinks that's all a stretch.",
      "\"We want there to be an origin,\" Nelson said. \"We don't want this to be just a holiday invented by Hallmark.\"",
      "It wasn't.",
      "Where did modern Valentine's Day traditions come from?",
      "\"The history of Valentine's Day that Americans sort of adopt and enjoy is the history that comes from England,\" Nelson said.",
      "Samuel Pepys, an English businessman and politician, wrote about Valentine's Day in the 15th century. Here's an excerpt from his diary:",
      "\"So up I went and took Mrs. Martha for my Valentine (which I do only for complacency), and Sir W. Batten he go in the same manner to my wife, and so we were very merry.\"",
      "\"Those diary entries get entered into the history as evidence of its ancient origin,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"One of the things that's interesting about how Valentine's Day was celebrated then is that even married people are having valentines who aren't their spouses,\" Nelson said. \"It really seems like a kind of ritual of friendship rather than a kind of make-or-break romantic love holiday.\"",
      "In America, interest in the holiday continued as a way of belonging.",
      "\"As Americans, we're torn between our insistence that we are no longer English because of the American Revolution, but then we are in love with all things English,\" she said.",
      "Valentine's Day in the U.S.",
      "There are examples of Valentine's Day being celebrated in 18th-century America.",
      "\"We have some very beautiful examples of handmade valentines, particularly from the Pennsylvania Dutch country,\" Nelson said, \"Sort of puzzle valentines, like where you unfold and unpack.\"",
      "Nelson says that once stationers began to print in the early part of the 19th century, the holiday started to kick off as we recognize it now.",
      "\"Esther Howland, for example, creates Valentines that are kind of layers of lace paper and little printed images and all kinds of beautiful sort of 3D effects, which are very popular kind of after 1850,\" Nelson said.",
      "Howland, the daughter of a Massachusetts stationer, is known as the \"mother of the American valentine,\" according to Mount Holyoke College, where she went to college in the 1840s.",
      "\"She started making these valentines in her family parlor, hired a whole bunch of local girls to help her, and sent them around with her brothers who were traveling salesmen,\" Nelson said.",
      "By the 1870s, Holland built a business to admire, but when her father grew sick, she sold it to entrepreneur George Whitney.",
      "\"She really kind of defined the aesthetic of when we think of Victorian valentines,\" Nelson said.",
      "The 19th century also helped establish valentines from secret admirers \u2014 and saw Valentine's Day haters emerge.",
      "\"One of the things that makes what you feel about the valentine complicated is if it's an anonymous valentine, which becomes a convention in the 19th century,\" Nelson said. \"If you know who the valentine is from, you might feel one thing. If you don't know who it's from, you might feel another.\"",
      "That's especially true if the anonymous messages are sour.",
      "\"People start to make and send what are called 'vinegar valentines' or 'cruel valentines,' which are usually little poems that say mean things about people,\" Nelson said. \"They are usually printed in a very cheap way. The crudest possible engravings, they'll have a little poem making fun of various character flaws or other things like that.\"",
      "What are Americans doing for Valentine's Day in 2025?",
      "Clever and crude valentines persist,\u00a0but romance and friendship still prevail on the holiday.",
      "For Vanna Black, an Atlanta-based artist, Valentine's Day is about reflection and celebration.",
      "\"Especially in today's time, what we're dealing with in the American society I think that spreading this type of love is going to be very meaningful and draw community together,\" Black said.",
      "It's a grave mission for Black, who grieves every Feb. 14 for her mother, who died on the day in 1999.",
      "\"This time was always very difficult for me to kind of process grief,\" Black said. \"My mom, she was always very encouraging of me doing my art.\"",
      "This year, Black sold her art at Boggs Social & Supply in southwest Atlanta for a Valentine's Day pop-up. The vendors included a sculptor, a florist and a woman selling odd jewelry that included animal bones turned into pendants, and other gory pieces reminiscent of the carnivalesque aspects of Victorian times.",
      "Boggs is a dark space and a clean slate for community artists to fill with life, so it served Black's pieces well. Her colorful cards and posters radiated her refreshing messages, such as \"We have everlasting love\" and \"Celebrating you.\" Another design exclaimed, \"You are the prettiest flower of them all.\"",
      "\"I wanted to be able to honor her in that way,\" Black said. \"I had to figure out how to turn it around into something positive versus something negative.\"",
      "Valentine's Day inspires \"Galentine's Day\"",
      "Around Valentine's Day, \"Galentines\" groups of friends, women and sometimes men who are single, take a moment to spend time together and celebrate their platonic loved ones \u2014 typically on Feb. 13 \u2014 taking their inspiration from an episode of the sitcom \"Parks and Recreation.\"",
      "Businesses have taken notice of the trend and are catering to those who want to take part in a real-life version of the celebration.",
      "This year, jewelry designer Malik Waseem Shuler of Urbane Jewelry Studio is leading a Galentine's jewelry-making happy hour at Atlanta's \"Kitty Dare\" Mediterranean-inspired restaurant that will incorporate crystals.",
      "\"It's the beginning of a crazy year,\" Schuler said. \"I think that a lot of people could use some positive energy.\"",
      "Shuler wants all kinds of relationships to be cherished and nurtured this Valentine's Day \u2013 a sentiment that has been growing in popularity.",
      "\"A lot of times our friends are in our lives longer than a romantic partner maybe,\" Shuler said.\u00a0 \"So I'm going to be leading the workshop and helping people set intentionality behind their crystals and the unique pieces that they're making.\"",
      "\"I'm gonna be bringing lots of rose quartz to attract love. I have garnet, I have some obsidian stones for protection against negative energies. We have amethyst known to bring peace and tranquility into the space,\" Shuler said.",
      "No matter its origin, Valentine's Day still celebrates friendship and romance, and even if the holiday currently seems to lean toward gifts over other love languages, it keeps bringing Americans together.",
      "\"There's a commercial side of Valentine, but then there's also the humanistic side of Valentine where love is 365,\" Vanna Black said. \"It doesn't end, it doesn't stop, it's always growing. Love is everlasting.\"",

    "story": [
      "Each Valentine's Day, millions of Americans gift their partners or loved ones with flowers, cards or candy as a token of their affections on Feb. 14. But while some see it as a commercialized \"Hallmark holiday,\" the occasion actually has ancient roots in Roman history and connections to Saint Valentine.",
      "Valentine's Day is the perfect chance to ask someone on a date or to cement a long-lasting commitment to a partner. It could also be a great day to set aside time for yourself or spend a meal with family and friends.",
      "Some other Americans, though, rail against a day they feel is an over-commercialization of love, or the holiday might make them feel lonely if they aren't in a pair.",
      "A 2024 CBS News/YouGov survey found that 68% of Americans in relationships planned on celebrating Valentine's Day last year, compared with 24% of those not in relationships. Overall, about half of Americans were expected to mark the day.",
      "Whether you adore or despise the occasion, you might find its deep and ancient-rooted history surprising.",
      "Why do we celebrate Valentine's Day?",
      "Since ancient Roman times, people have celebrated a loosely connected festival of love in the second week of February. However, the way people express their love this time of year is \"conditioned by the historical circumstances they live in,\" Yale professor of classics and history Noel Lenski told CBS News.",
      "For about a thousand years, starting in the 5th century B.C., Romans celebrated a festival on the 15th of February called Lupercalia, commemorating the founding of Rome and the fertility god Lupercus.",
      "This day was essentially a drunken, sexually charged festival at the Palatine Hill in Italy \u2014 where men would sacrifice a dog, and with its hide, would beat young women who wanted to be fertile \u2014 that lasted until the 5th century C.E. The most famous Lupercalia festival took place a month before Julius Caesar was assassinated on March 15, 44 B.C. when Caesar famously rejected the crown offered by Roman general Mark Antony.",
      "After the Catholic Church became the dominant power in Rome, the empire became more \"buttoned up,\" as Professor Lenski characterized it. Pope Gelasius, I ended Rome's Lupercalia Day in the 5th Century. Meanwhile, Christians began to hold a feast on Feb. 14 to celebrate Saint Valentine and the sanctity of marriage. Saint Valentine's feast could have been a replacement for Lupercalia, but Lenski said there's no hard proof of this.",
      "A lot about this day is very mysterious. There's a lot historians don't know and where the dots always connect.",
      "As culture shifted with time, so did Valentine's Day and gift-giving began in the 14th century, Lenski said. The holiday grew more secular as people of that time seemed to consider the day about love, poetry and gifts.",
      "\"Valentine's Day is characteristic of the place and time,\" Lenski said. \"It says more about the times than it does about Saint Valentine.\"",
      "Who was Saint Valentine?",
      "Lenski said Saint Valentine is more legendary than a real person\u2013 actually, two people. Two bishops are associated with Saint Valentine and both were martyrs \"who died on behalf of the Christian church in the face of persecution from the Romans,\" he said. One of the legends, Lenski said, is that a bishop secretly performed marriage ceremonies and a Pagan emperor of Rome killed him for doing so.",
      "Father Michael Clark of Saint Paul's Roman Catholic Church in Connecticut disagrees that there were multiple, legendary Saint Valentines.",
      "\"I have seen his skull with my own eyes,\" he said.",
      "Father Michael said Saint Valentine was one, very real person\u2013 or at least the man that the church honored with a feast was no legend. He said he did not know of the secret marriage ceremonies, but Valentine's martyrdom for his religion is what strongly resonated with people.",
      "\"Martyrdom, the giving up of your life, is uncompromising,\" said Father Michael. \"We want to think of our love as uncompromising, too.\" He said the person we love is \"someone we'd be prepared to give our all for.\"",
      "The Song of Solomon 8:6 from the Bible reads, \"love is stronger than death.\" Father Michael said this quote summarizes why Saint Valentine's message impacted people for so many years. Martyrs show people that love transcends one of the few things that unites us all, being alive.",
      "While Saint Valentine's feast is no longer celebrated on Feb. 14 by the church, the celebration of love in the U.S. has continued.",
      "Who or what is Cupid?",
      "Cupid is not just a Valentine's Day gimmick or cartoon character but also has its history in ancient Rome. Cupid comes from the Latin word Cupido, which means desire, and is the child and assistant of Aphrodite or Venus. Cupid shows us that erotic love has been with the human species since the beginning, said Lenski.",
      "Love and desire, he said, are a never-ending theme in literature and human experiences. It has always mystified people and we still don't understand it, truly, today.",
      "How do we celebrate Valentine's Day in the U.S. now?",
      "Valentine's Day has become a major commercial holiday in the U.S. and the love, or spending rather, keeps on growing. According to the National Retail Federation, consumers are expected to spend a record $27.5 billion on Valentine's Day in 2025. The most popular gifts are likely to be candy, flowers and greeting cards, followed by an evening out and jewelry.",
      "But like the Romans or the British during the late Middle Ages, Valentine's Day is a sign of the times for modern-day Americans, too.",
      "Lifestyle expert Kathy Copcutt told CBS News that the wildfires that ravaged the L.A. County area in January are impacting how her community is celebrating this year.",
      "Copcutt said she and her 11-year-old are meeting with a group of her close friends and their kids for a low-key dinner this year about \"celebrating life.\"",
      "She said Valentine's Day is also a great way to \"step out\" of the stresses of every day and simply gather with the people you love.",
      "\"I think this year it's more about being surrounded by your loved ones and friends because, thank God, they all made it,\" she said. \"Property can be replaced, but friends and family cannot. I'm holding them all close.",
      "Copcutt said she is calling the celebration with family \"Falentine's Day.\" Another popular way to celebrate is doing a \"Galentine's Day\" with friends. Copcutt suggests indulging in a high tea, which she said is very popular this year.",
      "She also emphasized self-love in 2025.",
      "\"If you can take any day out and take care of yourself, that's great. But if you had to choose a day, I would say Valentine's Day,\" she said. \" Do not be afraid to be alone.\"",
      "Father Michael said that people can't love their neighbor if they don't love themselves. So he also reminds people to \"be good to yourself\" on Valentine's Day and every day. \"You are inherently loveable.\"",

    "summary": "Organizations that receive funding from USAID and other agencies sued after they were cut off from federal funding for foreign assistance programs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to reinstate funding for foreign aid contracts and other awards while litigation moves forward, delivering yet another setback for the president as he seeks to make sweeping changes to the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali partially granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of organizations that receive funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, and other agencies, but have since been cut off from federal dollars or had to suspend their work in the wake of Mr. Trump's executive action ordering a 90-day pause on foreign development aid.",
      "The nonprofit organizations argued that Mr. Trump's directive and a subsequent memorandum from Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued late last month, which temporarily stopped new obligations of funding for foreign assistance programs and called for stop-work orders, was an unlawful and unconstitutional exercise of executive power.",
      "They warned that the directive has \"created chaos in the funding and administration\" of USAID and other foreign assistance programs.",
      "\"One cannot overstate the impact of that unlawful course of conduct: on businesses large and small forced to shut down their programs and let employees go; on hungry children across the globe who will go without; on populations around the world facing deadly disease; and on our constitutional order,\" lawyers for one group of challengers, led by the Global Health Council, wrote in a court filing.",
      "Ali, appointed by former President Joe Biden, blocked top Trump administration officials from enforcing a pause on foreign assistance funded through the State Department or USAID without authorization and halting new obligations of funding for foreign assistance programs pending a review. He also barred the administration from suspending contracts, grants or other foreign assistance awards that were in effect as of Jan. 19 and issuing stop-work orders in connection with foreign aid awards that were in existence before Mr. Trump returned to the White House.",
      "The judge said at the current stage of litigation, the nonprofit organizations met their burden for temporary, emergency relief, but that their request was too broad. But Ali found the groups were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and made a \"strong preliminary showing that they were likely to suffer irreparable harm.\"",
      "\"Here, the stated purpose in implementing the suspension of all foreign aid is to provide the opportunity to review programs for their efficiency and consistency with priorities,\" Ali wrote. \"However, at least to date, Defendants have not offered any explanation for why a blanket suspension of all congressionally appropriated foreign aid, which set off a shockwave and upended reliance interests for thousands of agreements with businesses, nonprofits, and organizations around the country, was a rational precursor to reviewing programs.\"",
      "In a hearing held Wednesday, Stephen Wirth, a lawyer representing one group of seven nonprofits, said his clients have been \"devastated\" by Mr. Trump's executive order. He warned that as a result of the freeze on funding for foreign assistance programs, small businesses have been forced to shutter, food for starving populations abroad is rotting in ports and warehouses, and medical supplies are expiring.",
      "Additionally, at least one group, Democracy International, an international development company that conducts projects for USAID, has had to furlough all 95 of its U.S.-based workers and 93% of its employees working on USAID projects in overseas offices, Wirth said.",
      "The federal government, he said, is terminating contracts \"en masse.\"",
      "Lawyers for the nonprofits said that organizations that receive foreign assistance grants have tried to draw down funding from USAID and the State Department, but have not been able to access their funds. In other instances, groups have had contracts terminated and pending invoices for completed work have not been paid, Wirth said.",
      "At least 230 USAID grants and contracts have been terminated or been subject to stop-work orders since Tuesday, Justice Department lawyers said in a filing.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its decision to issue the 90-day pause on U.S. foreign development assistance allows it to ensure that the projects the U.S. is supporting align with the administration's foreign policy.",
      "Eric Hamilton, deputy assistant attorney general, said during the hearing that the issue is about how money that has been appropriated by Congress is being spent. He argued federal laws governing foreign assistance allow the president to determine how those funds should be used.",
      "He also noted that Rubio has approved a waiver for life-saving humanitarian assistance programs.",
      "The cases before Ali arose from recent efforts by the Trump administration to overhaul USAID, which was founded in 1961 and is an independent agency. Its operations have been in turmoil over the past few weeks amid the Trump administration's freeze on foreign assistance funding and stop-work orders for USAID contractors and agency partners. The administration also moved to shut down overseas USAID missions and recall thousands of employees living and working abroad. The administration last week\u00a0placed thousands of USAID employees on administrative leave and closed the aid agency's Washington, D.C., headquarters to staff.",
      "But some of Mr. Trump's efforts have been stopped by another federal judge in Washington in a separate case brought by labor unions.",
      "U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, appointed by Mr. Trump, temporarily prohibited the government from placing more than 2,000 employees on administrative leave. He also ordered the administration to reinstate employees already on leave and blocked expedited evacuations of USAID employees from their host countries.",

    "summary": "The House is pursuing one massive package, while the Senate plans to divide its work into two.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House and Senate Republicans are racing to keep pace on competing budget proposals to enact President Trump's top priorities, with committees in both chambers voting to advance their respective plans this week.",
      "The House Budget Committee marked up its resolution on Thursday, one day after the Senate Budget Committee did the same. The House is pursuing one massive package, while the Senate plans to divide its work into two.",
      "But the chambers will have to approve identical budget resolutions to move forward with the reconciliation process, which allows them to avoid the 60-vote threshold typically required in the Senate. Going that route would allow Republicans to pass the legislation without any Democratic support. Under budget reconciliation, the package may only include provisions dealing with taxes, spending or the debt limit. And any new spending must be paid for.",
      "The Senate's resolution could come to the floor as early as next week. The House will be away on recess and plans to bring its own resolution when the lower chamber returns the following week.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has repeatedly insisted that the House take the lead on the reconciliation process, told reporters Thursday that \"there's a lot of discussion and debate and deliberation ahead of us.\" Still, he called the markup the \"necessary first start to get it going.\"",
      "\"We have a very diverse conference and we have to get everybody onboard,\" the Louisiana Republican said.",
      "What's in the House GOP proposal",
      "House Republicans have been at odds with their Senate colleagues, preferring to pass one major border and defense bill that also includes up to $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "The House resolution calls for at least $1.5 trillion in spending cuts and instructs more than a handful of committees to find ways to reduce the deficit, while increasing spending for several other issue areas.",
      "In a deal with conservatives, the House Budget Committee agreed to amend the budget resolution Thursday to secure the tax cut threshold. Under the agreement, if House committees don't achieve at least $2 trillion in spending cuts, then tax cuts would be lower than the proposed $4.5 trillion. But if they slash more than $2 trillion, tax cuts would be increased.",
      "The panels tasked with finding the steepest cuts are the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is instructed to propose at least $880 billion in cuts; the Education and Workforce Committee, with at least $330 billion; and the Agriculture Committee, with a minimum of $230 billion.",
      "The resolution instructs the Judiciary Committee to propose up to $110 billion in additional spending, while the Armed Services Committee could propose $100 billion in new spending. The Homeland Security Committee would be allotted $90 billion.",
      "What's in the Senate GOP plan",
      "On the other side of the Capitol, Senate Republicans have backed a two-bill strategy. The first is focused on border security, defense and energy priorities, while the second would include an extension of the tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "The Senate's first resolution would direct the Judiciary Committee and the Homeland Security Committee to each propose no more than $175 billion in additional spending. The Armed Services Committee could propose $150 billion in new spending, while the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee would be allotted $20 billion and the Environment and Public Works Committee $1 billion.",
      "Several other committees would be instructed to find at least $1 billion in cuts.",
      "The resolution would increase annual spending by $85.5 billion, which would be paid for by the same amount in spending cuts, according to Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who leads the Senate Budget Committee.",
      "Graham said Wednesday during debate on the upper chamber's proposal that he's \"pulling for one big, beautiful bill, but there's a sense of urgency\" in approving immigration-related funding.",
      "\"I hope you will consider what we do if you cannot produce the one big, beautiful bill quickly,\" Graham said.",
      "House Freedom Caucus gets onboard",
      "The House Freedom Caucus, a conservative faction that has been a thorn in the side of Republican leaders, unveiled its own two-step plan on Monday as the House faced repeated delays in releasing its package. But Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Thursday that with the amendment in place tying tax cuts to spending cuts, he expects members will support the budget resolution.",
      "GOP Reps. Ralph Norman of South Dakota and Chip Roy of Texas, two House Freedom Caucus members who were seen as potential roadblocks on the budget panel, came out in favor of the proposal during Thursday's hearing.",
      "\"This budget put forward by the chairman is a giant step forward to reduce spending,\" Roy said. \"I believe that it is responsible, and I believe it is a balance of what we're supposed to do.\"",
      "Harris outlined that the agreement will \"allow the flexibility to actually bring the tax cuts even higher\" if there's more spending cuts. In terms of where to find the cuts, Harris wouldn't point to specifics, deferring to the committees on where to find savings.",
      "The House GOP's estimates project an increase of $2.5 trillion in revenues due to economic growth sparked by the trillions in tax cuts. Harris called that a \"conservative\" estimate and said that \"when it all balances out, we believe that \u2026 it's actually going to result in deficit reduction.\"",
      "Asked whether the Freedom Caucus was still planning to release its own tax package, Harris said, \"No, this is it.\"",
      "\"We declare victory,\" Harris said, noting that the group was aiming for meaningful deficit reduction, and the ability to advance Mr. Trump's tax policy. \"We don't need another bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats have hammered the Republican blueprints, questioning how the proposals will help everyday Americans struggling with the high cost of living.",
      "\"Republicans in the House and Senate have shown no interest in making life better for everyday Americans, because it's all about tax cuts for the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York told reporters Wednesday. \"The Republicans with their budget have betrayed the middle class.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Texas man who killed his strip club manager and another man, then later prompted a massive lockdown of the state prison system when he used a cellphone smuggled onto death row to threaten a lawmaker, was executed Thursday night.",
      "Richard Lee Tabler, 46, was given a lethal injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. The time of death was 6:38 p.m. CST, 15 minutes after a lethal dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital was administered in his arms.",
      "\"There is not a day that goes by that I don't regret my actions,\" Tabler said, strapped to the death chamber gurney, looking at relatives of his victims who watched through a window a few feet away.",
      "\"I had no right to take your loved ones from you, and I ask and pray, hope and pray, that one day you find it in your hearts to forgive me for those actions,\" Tabler said. \"No amount of my apologies will ever return them to you.\"",
      "He expressed to love to his family and friends, lawyers and supporters, and he thanked prison officials for their compassion and \"the opportunity to show you that I can change and become a better man and rehabilitate.\"",
      "After apologizing several more times and saying this was the beginning of a new life for him in heaven, he told the warden: \"I am finished.\"",
      "As the drugs began, he mouthed once again, \"I'm sorry,\" then began breathing quickly. After about a dozen breaths, all movement stopped.",
      "Tabler \u2014 the second person executed in Texas in a little over a week, with two more scheduled by the end of April \u2014 was condemned for the Thanksgiving 2004 shooting deaths of Mohammed-Amine Rahmouni, 28, and Haitham Zayed, 25, in a remote area near Killeen in Central Texas.",
      "Rahmouni was the manager of a strip club where Tabler worked until he was banned from the place. Zayed was a friend of Rahmouni, and police said both men were killed in a late-night meeting to buy some stolen stereo equipment that was actually a planned ambush.",
      "Tabler also confessed to killing two teenage girls who worked at the club, Tiffany Dotson, 18, and Amanda Benefield, 16. He was indicted but never tried in their killings.",
      "Dotson's father, George, was among the witnesses. He declined to comment on Tabler's apologies, saying he needed time to process what he had just seen but was glad to have seen it.",
      "\"I couldn't wait,\" he said. \"It took me 20 years to get here.\"",
      "\"Today is for Tiffany,\" said her godfather, Tom Newton. \"And this is justice.\"",
      "Tabler had repeatedly asked the courts that his appeals be dropped and that he be put to death. He also has changed his mind on that point several times, and his attorneys have questioned whether he is mentally competent to make that decision. Tabler's prison record includes at least two instances of attempted suicide, and he was previously granted a stay of execution in 2010.",
      "\"Petitioner has spent the last twenty years in the Courts, and see's no point in wasting this Courts time, nor anyone else's,\" Tabler wrote to the state Court of Criminal Appeals on Dec. 9, 2024 after his current execution date was set.",
      "Tabler's death row phone calls in 2008 to state Sen. John Whitmire, who is now the mayor of Houston, prompted an unprecedented lockdown of more than 150,000 inmates in the the nation's second-largest prison system. Some were confined to their cells for weeks while officers swept more than 100 prisons to seize hundreds of items of contraband, including cellphones.",
      "Whitmire led a Senate committee with oversight of state prisons, and said at the time that Tabler warned him that he knew the names of his children and where they lived. Whitmire, through a spokesperson at the mayor's office, declined to comment on Tabler's pending execution.",
      "The ACLU appealed Tabler's case to the U.S. Supreme Court last year, claiming he was denied adequate legal representation during his lower court appeals by attorneys who refused to participate in hearings at what they said was his request.",
      "The ACLU appeal argued that Tabler's attorneys ignored a psychological exam that determined he had a \"deep and severe constellation of mental illnesses \" that had been ignored since childhood. The court refused to halt his execution.",
      "The club Tabler worked at was called TeaZers. Investigators said he had a conflict with his boss, Rahmouni, who allegedly said he could have Tabler's family \"wiped out\" for $10.",
      "Tabler recruited a friend, Timothy Payne, a soldier at nearby Fort Cavazos, and lured Rahmouni and Zayed to a meeting under the guise of buying the stolen stereo equipment. Tabler shot them both in their car, then pulled Rahmouni out and had Payne video him shooting Rahmouni again.",
      "Tabler later confessed to the killings. During the sentencing phase of his trial, prosecutors introduced Tabler's written and videotaped statements saying he also killed Dotson and Benefield days later because he was worried they would tell people he killed the men.",
      "Investigators said that before he was arrested, Tabler called the Bell County Sheriff's office to taunt deputies about the murders and threatened to kill more employees and undercover law enforcement at the strip club.",
      "Also Thursday, in Florida, a man convicted of killing a husband and wife during a fishing trip at a remote farm while their toddler looked on was put to death by lethal injection in that state's first execution this year.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS \u2014 A lawsuit filed on Thursday by attorneys general from 14 states challenges the authority of billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to access sensitive government data and exercise \"virtually unchecked power.\"",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., argues President Trump violated the appointments clause of the Constitution by creating a federal department without congressional approval.",
      "DOGE, which isn't an official government agency, was tasked by Mr. Trump to produce recommendations on trimming federal outlays, with billionaires Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, before he departed, \u00a0saying they\u00a0aimed to cut about $500 billion\u00a0in annual expenditures.",
      "Musk's team has roamed from agency to agency, tapping into computer systems, digging into budgets and searching for what he calls waste, fraud and abuse, while lawsuits pile up claiming Mr. Trump and DOGE are violating the law.",
      "The latest lawsuit details how, according to the state attorneys general, Musk has \"unraveled federal agencies, accessed sensitive data, and caused widespread disruption for state and local governments, federal employees, and the American people.\" It goes on to say DOGE \"endangers cybersecurity and erodes public trust.\"",
      "The New Mexico Department of Justice is leading the lawsuit with Arizona and Michigan as co-leads. Attorneys general from California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington also joined the lawsuit.",
      "They asked the court to order Musk to identify ways that \"any data obtained through unlawful agency access was used,\" destroy \"such unauthorized access in his or DOGE's possession\" and bar Musk and DOGE from ordering changes in the disbursement of public funds, canceling government contracts, taking steps to dismantle agencies and more.",
      "On Thursday, Musk called for the U.S. to \"delete entire agencies\" from the federal government as part of his push to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.",
      "Democratic attorneys general say Musk's approach is generating profound concerns among their constituents about the secure handling of sensitive information at agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the IRS.",
      "\"Donald Trump seems to think a narrow electoral victory makes him into a king. He could not be more wrong,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. \"Worse still, Trump installed Elon Musk at the head of that agency without vetting and Senate confirmation, and Musk has proceeded to use that unconstitutional appointment to try to cut the federal government to the bone.\"",
      "New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez said Mr. Trump is demonstrating \"weakness\" in deploying Musk rather than advancing his agenda through a Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "\"Move fast and breaking things may work in Silicon Valley for a tech company,\" Torrez said. \"It's not good governance and it's unconstitutional.\"",
      "The lawsuit seeks a court ruling declaring Musk's actions unconstitutional and wants his previous actions invalidated.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in New York temporarily\u00a0blocked DOGE from accessing Treasury Department records that contain sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans. U.S. District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer issued the preliminary injunction after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued Mr. Trump.",

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. is deporting unauthorized migrants from nations in Africa and Asia to Panama, a major diplomatic breakthrough for the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts, internal federal documents obtained by CBS News show.",
      "On Wednesday, an American military flight deported Asian migrants who were in U.S. immigration custody to Panama, the first known deportation of its kind under the Trump administration. They included adults and families with children from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran and Uzbekistan, according to the documents.",
      "Another U.S. military flight to Panama planned for Thursday is expected to deport more Asian migrants, in addition to some African deportees. The documents show they include migrants from Cameroon.",
      "In a statement Thursday, Panama's foreign ministry confirmed it received on Wednesday the first flight under an agreement with the Trump administration that allows the U.S. to deport non-Panamanians to the Central American country.",
      "The ministry said Wednesday's deportation flight included 119 deportees from Afghanistan, China, India, Iran, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. The costs of the deportations under the agreement will be covered by the U.S., the ministry added.",
      "The deportations to the Central American country, a corridor for the mass migration that has gripped the region in recent years, represent a significant diplomatic win for President Trump and his government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "The U.S. has long had difficulty deporting migrants from Africa and Asia, due to the long distances involved in deportations to the Eastern Hemisphere and decisions by governments in those continents to limit or reject American deportations flights. The New York Times first reported Wednesday's deportation of Asian migrants.",
      "The flights also underscore how aggressively and quickly the Trump administration is moving to convince countries across the region to accept migrants who are difficult to deport, even though they are not citizens of their nations.",
      "The governments of El Salvador and Guatemala have already agreed to accept migrant deportees from the U.S. who are not from their countries. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has even offered to accept and detain suspected members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who are expelled from the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed more deportation agreements, though it's unclear how many more arrangements will be agreed to. One plan that had been considered would have sent third-country nationals to the South American nation of Guyana, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "Panama's willingness to accept the deportees also comes as Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in retaking control of the strategically important Panama Canal, which the U.S. ceded to Panama in 1999. Panama's leaders have rejected the idea outright, and disputed claims by Mr. Trump and U.S. officials about China's influence on the canal's operations.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in his first international trip shortly after taking office, and the State Department said last week that the U.S. had reached a deal that would allow its military ships to transit the canal for free. Panama's president said no such deal had been reached and that the State Department's statement was \"based on a falsity.\"",

    "summary": "A Florida man convicted of killing a husband and wife at a remote farm in front of the couple's toddler has received a lethal injection in the state's first execution of the year.",
    "story": [
      "A Florida man convicted of killing a husband and wife at a remote farm as the couple's toddler looked on was put to death Thursday in the state's first execution of the year.",
      "James Dennis Ford, 64, was pronounced dead at 6:19 p.m. following a lethal injection at Florida State Prison, state officials said.",
      "Ford was convicted in a jury trial of the murders of Gregory Malnory, 25, and his wife Kimberly, 26. The two were killed during a fishing trip in 1997 at a sod farm in southwest Charlotte County where court records showed the two men were coworkers.",
      "The couple's 22-month-old daughter witnessed the killings while strapped in a seat in the family's open pickup truck. She survived an 18-hour ordeal before workers came upon the scene and found the girl covered in her mother's blood and suffering from numerous insect bites, according to investigators.",
      "The daughter, Maranda Malnory, recently told Fort Myers television station WBBH that she had no recollection of what had happened and only remembers her parents through photos and the memories of others. \"I told one of my grandmas the other day you grieve the people you knew,\" she said. \"But I grieve what could have been.\"",
      "First state execution in 2025",
      "Ford's execution was the first in Florida in 2025. One person was put to death in 2024, down from six in 2023, when Gov. Ron DeSantis was campaigning for the Republican presidential nomination. During the previous three years, the governor didn't sign off on any executions. He signed Ford's death warrant in January.",
      "Also Thursday evening, a man who murdered his strip club manager and another man, then later prompted a massive lockdown of the state prison system, was scheduled to be executed in Texas.",
      "The Malnory murders",
      "Court documents show Ford attacked Gregory Malnory after the group arrived to go fishing, shooting him in the head with a .22-caliber rifle, beating him with an axe-like blunt instrument and finally slitting his throat. Kimberly Malnory was beaten, raped and then shot with the same rifle, authorities had said.",
      "Ford initially told investigators that the Malnorys were alive when he left them to go hunting, suggesting someone else killed them. Prosecutors said in a court filing that there was \"overwhelming proof that Ford was responsible for the murders and the rape.\"",
      "The rifle was found later in a ditch near where Ford's truck had run out of gas and prosecutors presented DNA evidence at his trial connecting him to both slayings. The jury voted 11-1 to recommend the death penalty in the killings, to which the trial judge agreed.",
      "Legal battles",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court denied Ford's final appeal Wednesday without comment.",
      "Ford's lawyers had filed numerous appeals since his sentencing, all unsuccessful. Recently the Florida Supreme Court rejected claims that his IQ of about 65 at the time of the murders put him in an intellectually disabled category with a mental age then of about 14 \u2014 therefore ineligible for execution, court documents show.",
      "The court noted that only defendants whose chronological age was under 18 at the time of a crime can be ineligible for the death penalty \"and because Ford was 36 at the time of the murders, it was \"impossible for him to demonstrate that he falls within the ages of exemption.\"",
      "It's not clear from court records why these killings happened. Part of Ford's defense was that he suffered from abuse as a child and became an alcoholic like his father, drinking about a case of beer a day along with liquor. He also suffered from untreated diabetes, sometimes leading to blackouts and erratic behavior.",
      "At trial, Ford also was convicted of sexual battery with a firearm and child abuse.",

      "Thousands of Californians who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires last month are now grappling with insurance claims. And with research showing that extreme weather today\u00a0poses a threat to nearly half of all U.S. homes, it's important to know exactly how much coverage you have so that when disaster strikes, you're not left standing in the rubble.",
      "Indeed, as many as 3 in 4 U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, reports CBS News national consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi. That means more Americans should get to know their insurance policies, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the nonprofit After the Fire USA.",
      "\"Well, the first thing you have to do is actually read your policy, and most of us don't do that, and so really encourage you to either sit down with somebody who is an expert in insurance \u2014 your underwriter [the insurance company] will be able to do this with you,\" Thompson told Quraishi.",
      "How much coverage do I need?",
      "Determining how much insurance you have, versus what you need to rebuild your a home in case of a disaster, is relatively straighforward. Start by taking the dollar amount of your policy coverage limit and dividing that by the square footage of your house or apartment.",
      "The resulting figure should equal the average construction cost per square foot in your area \u2014 a dollar amount Quraishi said you can find by doing an online search for \"construction cast per square foot,\" along with your zip code.",
      "For those who discover they have no protection of any kind of natural disaster, or after doing the math find that they're not sufficiently covered, the next step should be to get the maximum amount of coverage they can.",
      "\"Do go to your underwriter and ask,\" Thompson said. \"Max out on your insurance \u2014 it does cost us a little bit more every single month, but it's just incredibly important. Some people won't call because they're afraid of being dropped. Do not do that.\"",
      "Make a list of all your things",
      "Your home insurance policy should also cover possessions, also known as contents insurance. To be sure you're fully covered, make a list of all of your belongings, along with their estimated value. Update the list every year and let your agent know about any large purchases, from jewelry to cars.",
      "\"Most people don't even know they have contents insurance as part of their insurance policy,\" Thompson said. \"See how much it is.\"",
      "When to call Fema",
      "If you find yourself in the middle of a crisis while underinsured, you can contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 800-621-3362 from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Pacific time seven days a week. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also may be able to provide assistance and negotiate with your insurance company.",
      "What if you think you're underinsured?",
      "If after reading your policy and calculating your coverage you determine you're underinsured, but your insurance provider insists that you're fine, Thompson suggests having them put that in writing.",
      "\"Ask them to actually put it in writing \u2014 an email or something back to you that is official saying that you are adequately insured,\" she said. \"You must have it in writing and in some way that you can easily access it.\"",

      "But researchers who indulged their curiosity in the name of science found that well-preserved Egyptian mummies actually smell pretty good.",

      "\"Woody,\" \"spicy\" and \"sweet\" were the leading descriptions from what sounded more like a wine tasting than a mummy sniffing exercise. Floral notes were also detected, which could be from pine and juniper resins used in embalming.",
      "The study published Thursday in the Journal of the American Chemical Society used both chemical analysis and a panel of human sniffers to evaluate the odors from nine mummies as old as 5,000 years that had been either in storage or on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
      "The researchers wanted to systematically study the smell of mummies because it has long been a subject of fascination for the public and researchers alike, said Bembibre, one of the report's authors. Archeologists, historians, conservators and even fiction writers have devoted pages of their work to the subject \u2014 for good reason.",
      "Scent was an important consideration in the mummification process, which used oils, waxes and balms to preserve the body and its spirit for the afterlife. The practice was largely reserved for pharaohs and nobility. Pleasant smells were associated with purity and deities, while bad odors were signs of corruption and decay.",
      "Without sampling the mummies themselves, which would be invasive, researchers from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia were able to measure whether aromas were coming from the archaeological item, pesticides or other products used to conserve the remains, or from deterioration due to mold, bacteria or microorganisms.",
      "\"We were quite worried that we might find notes or hints of decaying bodies, which wasn't the case,\" said Matija Strli\u010d, a chemistry professor at the University of Ljubljana. \"We were specifically worried that there might be indications of microbial degradation, but that was not the case, which means that the environment in this museum, is actually quite good in terms of preservation.\"",
      "Using technical instruments to measure and quantify air molecules emitted from sarcophagi to determine the state of preservation without touching the mummies was like the Holy Grail, Strli\u010d said.",
      "\"It tells us potentially what social class a mummy was from and and therefore reveals a lot of information about the mummified body that is relevant not just to conservators, but to curators and archeologists as well,\" he said. \"We believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections.\"",
      "Barbara Huber, a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany who was not involved in the study, said the findings provide crucial data on compounds that could preserve or degrade mummified remains. The information could be used to better protect the ancient bodies for future generations.",
      "\"However, the research also underscores a key challenge: the smells detected today are not necessarily those from the time of mummification,\" Huber said. \"Over thousands of years, evaporation, oxidation, and even storage conditions have significantly altered the original scent profile.\"",
      "Huber authored a study two years ago that analyzed residue from a jar that had contained mummified organs of a noblewoman to identify embalming ingredients, their origins and what they revealed about trade routes. She then worked with a perfumer to create an interpretation of the embalming scent, known as \"Scent of Eternity,\" for an exhibition at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark.",
      "Researchers of the current study hope to do something similar, using their findings to develop \"smellscapes\" to artificially recreate the scents they detected and enhance the experience for future museumgoers.",
      "\"Museums have been called white cubes, where you are prompted to read, to see, to approach everything from a distance with your eyes,\" Bembibre said. \"Observing the mummified bodies through a glass case reduces the experience because we don't get to smell them. We don't get to know about the mummification process in an experiential way, which is one of the ways that we understand and engage with the world.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 08:15:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Vance is to meet with Zelenskyy amid concerns over U.S.-Russia talks to end the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance hammered home the United States demand that the NATO alliance step up defense spending on Friday, ahead of a security meeting in Europe at a time of intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration's foreign policy.",
      "The future of Ukraine is the top item on the agenda at the Munich Security Conference following a phone call between U.S. President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, when they pledged to work together to end the 3-year-old Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
      "Vance is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later Friday for talks that many observers, particularly in Europe, hope will shed at least some light on Trump's ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war.",
      "Vance started his day in Munich meeting separately with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and British foreign secretary David Lammy. He used the engagements to reiterate the Republican Trump administration's call for NATO members to spend more on defense. Currently, 23 of NATO's 32 member nations are hitting the Western military alliance's target of spending 2% of the nation's GDP on defense.",
      "\"NATO is a very important military alliance, of course, that we're the most significant part of,\" Vance told Rutte. \"But we want to make sure that NATO is actually built for the future, and we think a big part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden sharing in Europe, so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia.\"",
      "Rutte said he agreed that Europe needs to step up. \"We have to grow up in that sense and spend much more,\" he said.",
      "Hours before Vance and Zelenskyy were set to meet, a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the protective confinement shell of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Kyiv region, the Ukrainian president said. Radiation levels have not increased, Zelenskyy and the U.N. atomic agency said.",
      "Zelenskyy in Munich told reporters that he thinks the Chernobyl drone strike is a \"very clear greeting from Putin and Russian Federation to the security conference.\"",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday denied Ukraine's claims. And Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the Munich organizers haven't invited Russia for several years, a decision she called \"strange and politicized.\"",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was supposed to join Vance and Zelenskyy but was delayed when his Air Force plane had to return to Washington after developing a mechanical problem en route to Munich. He took a different aircraft, but it was unclear whether he would arrive in time for the meeting.",
      "Trump, who upended years of steadfast U.S. support for Ukraine during his call with Putin on Wednesday, has been vague about his specific intentions - other than suggesting that a deal will likely result in Ukraine being forced to cede territory that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014.",
      "\"The Ukraine war has to end,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"Young people are being killed at levels that nobody's seen since World War II. And it's a ridiculous war.\"",
      "Trump's musings have left Europeans in a quandary, wondering how - or even if - they can maintain the post-WWII security that NATO afforded them or fill the gap in the billions of dollars of security assistance that the Democratic Biden administration provided to Ukraine since Russia's February 2022 invasion.",
      "Trump has been highly skeptical of that aid and is expected to cut or otherwise limit it as negotiations get underway in the coming days.",
      "Both Trump and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week undercut Ukraine's hopes of becoming part of NATO, which the alliance said less than a year ago was \"irreversible,\" or of getting back its territory captured by Russia, which currently occupies close to 20% including Crimea.",
      "\"I don't see any way that a country in Russia's position could allow ... them to join NATO,\" Trump said Thursday. \"I don't see that happening.\"",
      "But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Zelenskyy on Friday that Ukraine must be allowed to join NATO.",
      "Trump in recent days said he wants to reach an agreement with Ukraine to gain access to the country's rare earth materials as a condition for continuing U.S. support for Ukraine's defense against Russia. He confirmed earlier this week that aides were working toward striking such a deal.",
      "Asked Friday if a deal might be completed in Munich, Vance responded, \"We'll see.\"",
      "Vance, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said that the U.S. would hit Moscow with sanctions and potentially military action if Putin won't agree to a peace deal with Ukraine that guarantees Kyiv's long-term independence.",
      "The warning that military options \"remain on the table\" was striking language from a Trump administration that's repeatedly underscored a desire to quickly end the war.",
      "The U.S. reassurances may have somewhat allayed Zelenskyy's fears, although they will not replace any lost military or economic support that President Joe Biden's administration had provided.",
      "The Ukrainian leader conceded Thursday that it was \"not very pleasant\" that Trump spoke first to Putin. But he said the main issue was to \"not allow everything to go according to Putin's plan.\"",
      "\"We cannot accept it, as an independent country, any agreements (made) without us,\" Zelenskyy said as he visited a nuclear power plant in western Ukraine.",
      "The track Trump is taking also has rocked Europe, much as his dismissive comments about France and Germany did during his first term.",
      "French Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Haddad described Europe as being at a turning point, with the ground shifting rapidly under its feet, and said Europe must wean itself off its reliance on the United States for its security. He warned that handing a victory to Russia in Ukraine could have repercussions in Asia, too.",
      "\"I think we're not sufficiently grasping the extent to which our world is changing. Both our competitors and our allies are busy accelerating,\" Haddad told broadcaster France Info on Thursday.",

      "Hamza said that the eight-day trial proved that Dawson engaged in conduct which caused Chen's death while they were staying at an exclusive island resort, the Fiji Times said. Hamza also said that Dawson intended to cause Chen's death or was reckless as to causing it, according to the Fiji Times.",
      "Chen, a graduate of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, was working as a pharmacist at the time of her death, CBS affiliate WREG reported.",
      "Members of the staff had heard the couple arguing before the murder, and Chen was found the next day by resort staff, with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head. In 2022, a lawyer representing Christe Chen's parents said their daughter's body was so badly damaged that she couldn't be embalmed for return to the U.S. and her remains were cremated.",
      "Dawson fled by kayak to a nearby island after he killed Chen. He was found about 36 hours after Chen's body was discovered, with his passport and other belongings with him. Hamza said this indicated he planned to flee.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis was to be hospitalized to treat bronchitis and undergo some necessary diagnostic tests, the Vatican said Friday, confirming the latest issues with the 88-year-old's pontiff's health. A spokesperson said he was expected to be there for \"a few days.\"",
      "Francis was diagnosed with bronchitis last Thursday, but has continued to hold daily audiences in his Vatican hotel suite, attended his general audience Wednesday and even presided at an outdoor Mass on Sunday. He has, however, handed off his speeches for an aide to read aloud, saying he was having trouble breathing.",

      "Ever since his diagnosis, Francis has appeared bloated, an indication the medication he was taking to treat the lung infection was making him retain water.",
      "Francis is being hospitalized at Rome's Gemelli hospital, where he was last hospitalized in June 2023 to have surgery to remove intestinal scar tissue and repair a hernia in the abdominal wall. A few months before that, he spent three days in the hospital to receive intravenous antibiotics for a respiratory infection.",
      "A Vatican statement said Francis would be admitted at the end of his Friday audiences. In addition to regular Vatican officials, the pope met Friday morning with the Slovak prime minister, Robert Fico, and the head of CNN, Mark Thompson.",
      "\"This morning, at the end of the audiences, Pope Francis will be admitted to the Agostino Gemelli Polyclinic for some necessary diagnostic tests and to continue in a hospital setting treatment for bronchitis that is still ongoing,\" the statement said.",

On the calendar is an audience with artists Saturday, a Mass on Sunday and a trip to Rome's famed Cinecitta studios on Monday.",

      "Hamas said Thursday that it would continue releasing hostages according to the terms of the ceasefire and hostage release deal with Israel, several days after it accused Israel of violating the agreement and said it would delay the next scheduled exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners. Under the terms of the deal between Israel and Hamas, which is a U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group, that exchange is set to take place on Saturday, with the release of three more Israeli hostages and dozens more Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"Hamas confirms continuation in implementing the agreement in accordance with what was signed, including the exchange of prisoners according to the specified timetable,\" Hamas said in a statement.",
      "Hamas said it had spoken to negotiators in Egypt and Qatar about, \"the necessity of adhering to implementing all terms\" of the the agreement with Israel, particularly relating to \"securing housing for our people and urgently bringing in caravans, tents, heavy equipment, medical supplies, fuel, and continuing the flow of humanitarian aid, as stipulated in the agreement.\"",

      "Archaeologists have uncovered the remnants of London's earliest-known ancient Roman basilica on the site of a planned 32-story skyscraper, right in the heart of what was once known as Londinium. Excavations in the basement of a building slated to be demolished to make way for the the new tower at 85 Gracechurch Street uncovered flint, brick and ragstone walls and foundations over three feet wide, 13 feet deep and almost two millennia old.",
      "Sophie Jackson of the Museum of London Archaeology called it \"one of the most significant discoveries\" in years in British capital's oldest quarter, the City of London \u2014 the square-mile financial district where modern glass high-rises stand atop the remnants of Victorian, medieval and much earlier structures.",
      "The scientists say they have uncovered the foundations of a two-story building that was almost as big as an Olympic swimming pool. It was constructed between 78 and 84 A.D., about three decades after Roman troops invaded the British isles and roughly 20 years after forces of the Celtic warrior queen Boudicca sacked the fledgling settlement.",
      "The basilica was part of the forum, the social, political and commercial heart of Roman London, or Londinium, as it was called, where people went to shop, mingle, seek justice and hear the latest edicts from political leaders. The newly discovered remains are believed to form part of the tribunal, a raised area of the forum where politicians and officials made decisions about the city's governance.",
      "\"We're talking about the early stages of London here,\" said Andrew Henderson-Schwartz, head of public impact at Museum of London Archaeology. \"But it's a real sign of investment in the city, even in its early infancy.\"",
      "Developer Hertshten Properties, which owns the site and has planning permission for a new office tower, has agreed to incorporate the remains into its plans and put them on display in a visitor center.",
      "Henderson-Schwartz said the extent of the \"absolutely massive\" foundations discovered in several test pits dug by archaeologists suggests an \"extraordinary\" level of preservation of the building ruins.",
      "Further digging could answer intriguing questions, including why the original forum was only used for 20 years before being replaced by a much larger one, which remained in use until the collapse of Roman rule in Britain three centuries later. Items such as writing tablets, styluses \u2014 even ancient trash \u2014 could offer glimpses into the daily lives of Roman Londoners.",
      "Property developers in Britain routinely have to bring in archaeologists as consultants as part of the construction planning process, a practice that has uncovered finds from Anglo-Saxon jewelry and remains and medieval ice skates to the skeletons of 14th-century plague victims.",
      "The latest discovery adds to the traces of Roman London that can be seen around the city, including a section of the ancient wall that once surrounded Londinium, a portion of an amphitheater and a temple to the god Mithras that lies incongruously under the modern headquarters of information company Bloomberg.",
      "\"We do have these little windows into Roman London that are all over the city,\" Henderson-Schwartz said. \"But this is really in some ways the site that connects them all together. This is the heart of Rome in London, where all the decisions were made.\"",
      "Elsewhere in England, archaeologists have recently discovered a \"mysterious lump\" of a purple substance that in Roman times would have been worth more than gold, and a stash of coins worth over $125,000 dating back to the reign of Emperor Nero.",

    "story": [
      "Dubai, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Elon Musk called Thursday to \"delete entire agencies\" from the U.S. government as part of his push under President Trump to radically cut spending and restructure its priorities.",
      "Musk offered a wide-ranging survey via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, of what he described as the priorities of the Trump administration interspersed with multiple references to \"thermonuclear warfare\" and the possible dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "In remarks similar to ones he made in the Oval Office Tuesday\u00a0with the president looking on, Musk said, \"We really have here rule of the bureaucracy as opposed to rule of the people \u2014 democracy,\" Musk said, wearing a black T-shirt that read: \"Tech Support.\" He also joked that he was the \"White House's tech support,\" borrowing from his profile on the social platform X, which he owns.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "While Musk has spoken to the summit in the past, his appearance Thursday comes as he has consolidated control over large swaths of the government with Mr. Trump's blessing since assuming leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency. That's included sidelining career officials, gaining access to sensitive databases and inviting a constitutional clash over the limits of presidential authority.",
      "Musk's new role gave his comments more weight beyond being the world's wealthiest person through his investments in SpaceX and electric carmaker Tesla.",
      "His remarks also offered a more-isolationist view of American power in the Middle East, where the U.S. has fought wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq since the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",
      "\"A lot of attention has been on USAID for example,\" Musk said, referring to Mr. Trump's dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development. \"There's like the National Endowment for Democracy. But I'm like, 'O.K. Well, how much democracy have they achieved lately?'\"",
      "He added that the U.S. under Mr. Trump is \"less interested in interfering with the affairs of other countries.\"",
      "There are \"times the United States has been kind of pushy in international affairs, which may resonate with some members of the audience,\" Musk said, speaking to the crowd in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms.",
      "\"Basically, America should mind its own business, rather than push for regime change all over the place,\" he said.",
      "He also noted the Trump administration's focus on eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion work, at one point linking it to AI.",
      "\"If hypothetically, AI is designed for DEI, you know, diversity at all costs, it could decide that there's too many men in power and execute them,\" Musk said.",
      "On AI, Musk said he believed X's newly updated AI chatbot, Grok 3, would be ready in about two weeks, calling it at one point \"kind of scary.\" He criticized Sam Altman's management of OpenAI, which Musk just led a $97.4 billion takeover bid for, describing it as akin to a nonprofit aimed at saving the Amazon rainforest becoming a \"lumber company that chops down the trees.\"",
      "Musk also announced plans for a \"Dubai Loop\" project in line with his work in the Boring Company - which is digging tunnels in Las Vegas to speed transit. However, he and the Emirati government official speaking with him offered no immediate details of the plan.",
      "\"It's going to be like a wormhole,\" Musk promised. \"You just wormhole from one part of the city \u2014 boom \u2014 and you're out in another part of the city.\"",

      "A Chinese J-16 fighter released flares on Tuesday that passed within 30 meters (100 feet) of a P-8 Poseidon surveillance jet in daylight and in international air space, Defense Minister Richard Marles said on Thursday.",
      "The Australian plane usually carries eight or nine crew. The plane was not damaged and no crew member was injured, Marles said.",
      "\"The J-16 was so close that there's no way you could have been able to ensure that the flares did not hit the P-8,\" Marles told Sky News.",

      "The protest accused the two Chinese pilots of an \"unsafe and unprofessional maneuver that posed a risk to the aircraft and personnel,\" a statement said.",
      "The protest highlights that while bilateral diplomatic and trade relations have improve, relations between the two militaries remain dangerous.",
      "The interaction is the first significant clash between Chinese and Australian forces that Australia has disclosed in nine months.",

      "There were no injuries or damage, although experts warned the helicopter could have been forced to ditch at sea if a flare had struck an engine.",
      "China protested at the time that the helicopter had flown close to Chinese airspace and had attempted to carry out reconnaissance on a Chinese navy training exercise.",
      "In November 2023, Australia accused Beijing of an unsafe and unprofessional interaction off the coast of Japan after a Chinese destroyer came close to an Australian military ship where divers were trying to untangle fishing nets from its propellers. Australia's defense ministry said the Chinese vessel was \"operating its hull-mounted sonar in a manner that posed a risk to the safety of the Australian divers who were forced to exit the water.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 04:12:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Of the 124 journalists and media workers who were killed in 2024, 82 were killed in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, the Committee to Protect Journalists said.",
    "story": [
      "A record number of journalists were killed in 2024, the Committee to Protect Journalists said\u00a0in a report released Wednesday. At least 124 journalists and media workers were killed worldwide, and about two-thirds of them were Palestinians who were killed by Israel during its war against Hamas in Gaza, the CPJ said.",
      "The previous record was 113 journalists killed, in 2007, during the Iraq War.",
      "Other countries including Sudan, Pakistan, Mexico and Syria also had multiple cases of journalists killed last year, the report found.",
      "The CPJ considers a journalist or media worker someone who covered news or commented on public affairs, in any medium. To be included on its list, the person's death must have been work-related. The deaths can be deliberate or accidental, such as if a journalist is killed in a conflict zone. A journalist's death would not be included if there is evidence they were \"inciting violence with imminent effect or directly participating as\u00a0combatants\u00a0in armed conflict at the time of their deaths,\" the CPJ said.",
      "The CPJ says it only includes confirmed cases in its report, meaning it found evidence indicating the journalist was killed in connection with their work; it says it considers all war-zone cases as confirmed.",
      "Increased global conflict leads to record deaths",
      "Of the 124 journalists who were killed in 2024, the CPJ report said 82 were killed amid the war in Gaza\u00a0and three were\u00a0killed in Lebanon, where Israel was fighting Hezbollah. In at least 10 cases, CPJ says its investigation determined they were \"deliberately targeted.\" The group says it continues investigating whether at least 20 other cases may have been deliberate.",
      "Thirty-one of the journalists killed in Gaza were Palestinian freelancers who the CPJ said \"stepped in to fill the information void after many news outlets ceased to operate\" in the territory.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News, the Israel Defense Forces said it \"takes all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians including journalists\" and that it \"has never, and will never, deliberately target journalists.\"",
      "The IDF sent a list of about half of a dozen \"so-called journalists named in CPJ's reports who've been found to have actively participated in and led terror efforts against Israel,\" including at least two whom it accused of directly participating \"in the October 7th massacre\" orchestrated by Hamas.",
      "Israel's military has frequently alleged that \"terror operatives\" in Gaza have doubled as journalists and could therefore be \"legitimate military targets,\" including some who've worked for Al Jazeera. The Qatari network has strongly denied this allegation.",
      "The uptick in journalist deaths comes amid a rising number of conflicts globally, the CPJ said. The other journalist killings in 2024 occurred in over a dozen countries, including Sudan, Pakistan and Mexico.",
      "Sudan and Pakistan saw six journalist killings each, while Mexico had five. Four journalists were killed in Syria. Three died in Myanmar, where underground reporters are \"increasingly treated as enemy combatants,\" according to the CPJ. Another three journalist deaths were recorded in Iraq, marking the first journalist deaths there since 2020. Two journalists were killed in Haiti, where \"gangs now openly claim responsibility for journalist killings,\" the CPJ said.",
      "The CPJ said that it found countries where journalists are deliberately killed often try to \"bury evidence of killings, shift blame, and avoid accountability.\" Such actions put surviving journalists in even more danger, the group said, and remove \"the possibility of justice\" for those who have died.",
      "Around the world, journalists have also been intimidated, censored and arrested or assaulted. Such incidents were reported in Cameroon, Somalia and Afghanistan, even though there were no journalists killed in those countries. There were also no journalist deaths in the war between Ukraine and Russia, though several possibly targeted attacks left reporters injured, the CPJ said. A\u00a0Ukrainian journalist who was detained in August 2023 died in Russian custody last year.",
      "\"Conditions can grow more lethal for the press when those who kill journalists are not held to account. And fewer journalists means less information for citizens seeking the truth,\" the CPJ said.",

      "The call between Mr. Trump and Putin was the first known conversation between the two since the president returned to the White House for a second term. It came a day after Russia released\u00a0Pennsylvania schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was serving a 14-year sentence and was considered by the U.S. to be wrongfully detained.",
      "\"I just had a lengthy and highly productive phone call with President Vladimir Putin of Russia,\" the president wrote on Truth Social\u00a0Wednesday morning. \"We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he and Putin talked about the \"great benefit that we will someday have in working together\" and agreed on the need to end Russia's war with Ukraine. In addition to the pledge to begin discussions on the war, the president and his Russian counterpart said they would visit \"each other's nation.\"",
      "The president said he has directed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, national security adviser Michael Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to lead negotiations on the war.",
      "Speaking in the Oval Office later in the day, Mr. Trump said the phone call with Putin lasted roughly an hour, and said the two leaders would likely meet in Saudi Arabia for their first sitdown of his new term. He told reporters that Putin \"wants peace\" and \"wants to see it end.\" Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon after his call with the Russian leader. Zelenskyy wrote in a post on X that \"[n]o one wants peace more than Ukraine\" and that Ukraine is \"charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace.\" Mr. Trump wrote in a statement on Truth Social that the conversation with Zelenskyy went \"very well\" and said it's \"time to stop this ridiculous War, where there has been massive, and totally unnecessary, DEATH and DESTRUCTION.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's conversation with Putin came shortly after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed to undercut\u00a0key Ukrainian positions in eventual peace talks, including by ruling out eventual membership in NATO. Speaking ahead of a closed-door meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contract Group about more aid, Hegseth said peace in the country must include security guarantees that \"should not be provided through NATO membership, but must instead be backed by capable European and non-European troops.\"",
      "The defense chief also said Ukraine's goal of returning to its borders before 2014, when Russia first invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula, was an \"unrealistic objective.\"",
      "The president, too, has addressed the prospect of Russia maintaining control of Ukrainian territory its forces have occupied, suggesting in an interview with Fox News that aired Monday that Ukraine \"may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday.\"",
      "In the Oval Office on Wednesday, Mr. Trump also said he is \"OK\" with taking the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO off the table. \"I don't think it's practical,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump frequently claims that Russia would not have launched its invasion of Ukraine three years ago if he were president and vowed on the campaign trail to quickly bring an end to the war. Vice President JD Vance is set to meet\u00a0with Ukraine's Zelenskyy at a security conference in Munich that begins Friday.",
      "The president has been a vehement critic of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, prompting concerns from Kyiv that assistance would stop flowing with him back in office. He told Fox News that aid could depend on Ukraine agreeing a trade deal that gives the U.S. access to its rare earth minerals.",
      "\"We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,\" he said. \"They have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.\"",

      "Norwitz \u2014 a self-described \"academician\" with a PhD in metabolic health, who is currently finishing his medical degree \u2014 told Fox News Digital that he's always had a passion for sharing his \"joy and interest\"\u00a0in science.",
      "RED MEAT COULD RAISE DEMENTIA RISK, RESEARCHERS CLAIM",
      "See Norwitz's eight myths below \u2014 followed by input and perspective from other health experts.",
      "Myth No. 1: There is no evidence for the carnivore diet",
      "Norwitz noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet, including a Harvard study of 2,029 participants that found \"high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being and various medical conditions.\"",
      "Other research that Norwitz himself conducted showed that the diet helped to alleviate inflammatory\u00a0bowel disease and restrictive eating disorders, he said.",
      "A Harvard medical student and researcher, Nick Norwitz, recently released a video in which he debunked eight myths surrounding the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz)",
      "While he called the results \"impressive\" and claimed that thousands of people have benefited from the carnivore diet, Norwitz noted that randomized controlled trials have not been conducted.",
      "\"These trials will need to be completed before conventional medicine can recommend a carnivore diet as a metabolic health prevention for any specific disorder,\" he says in his video.",
      "Myth No. 2: The diet increases the risk of scurvy",
      "Some claim that a carnivore diet could increase the risk of scurvy due to a vitamin C deficiency, Norwitz said.",
      "\"While it\u2019s true it's difficult to meet the RDA daily dose of 75 to 90 milligrams of vitamin C by eating only meat, there are about 25 micrograms per gram of vitamin C in fresh, grass-fed beef, so eating about 2 pounds of meat daily should give you about 18 milligrams of vitamin C.\"",
      "MEAT 'CHEAT MEALS' AMONG VEGETARIANS, VEGANS 'MORE COMMON THAN YOU MIGHT THINK'",
      "While this is still well below the recommended daily amount, Norwitz went on, \"that doesn't necessarily mean one will develop a vitamin C deficiency or the associated medical condition, which is scurvy.\"",
      "When Norwitz himself did a six-month carnivore diet experiment and then tested his vitamin C levels, he found they were normal, even bordering on being high. He explains the science behind that result in the video.",
      "Myth No. 3: Lack of fiber will cause constipation",
      "While it is true that a majority of the nutrition a person consumes on a carnivore diet will be absorbed in the small intestine, leading to an overall decline in fecal mass, \"you will still poop,\" Norwitz said in the video.",
      "\"Some studies suggest that fiber elimination can actually help manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation,\" he added.",
      "Norwitz (left) noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz/iStock)",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean fiber is bad or that long-term zero-fiber diets wouldn't have negative consequences on the microbiome, he noted.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse,\" he said. \"There are many, like me, who feel better on low- or no-fiber diets, so it's a legitimate individual choice.\"",
      "Myth No. 4: The carnivore diet will harm athletic performance",
      "Norwitz disputes this claim, noting that as the body adapts to carbohydrate restriction, the capacity to burn fat increases.",
      "\"A new study of Iron Man athletes has debunked the idea that the body needs a high intake of carbohydrates during intense exercise to maintain peak performance,\" he said.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse.\"",
      "Norwitz goes into greater detail about the association between diet and athletic performance in his video, as does another doctor.",
      "Myth No. 5: The diet will lead to heart attacks",
      "While Norwitz acknowledges that a diet rich in red meat and saturated fat can increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and its associated marker (ApoB), which is a risk factor for heart disease, the extent to which a carnivore diet affects those levels is \"highly individual.\"",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"Some people even see LDL cholesterol and ApoB decrease, and many don't see any change,\" he says in the video.",
      "There are many risk factors for heart disease beyond cholesterol, Norwitz noted. These include visceral fat, insulin resistance, inflammation triglycerides and HDL, all of which could actually be improved on very low-carbohydrate diets.",
      "'I WENT ON A VEGAN DIET AND MY CHOLESTEROL WENT UP \u2014 HERE'S WHY'",
      "\"So a carnivore diet does not implicitly increase heart disease risk \u2014 but the bottom line here is that different people respond differently,\" he said.",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"",
      "Myth No. 6: The carnivore diet is an eating disorder",
      "Eating disorders are defined as \"restrictive eating patterns that impair physical or mental health,\" Norwitz noted.",
      "\"So if a person cures or goes into remission from a debilitating chronic disease \u2014 be that obesity, diabetes, depression, schizophrenia, inflammatory bowel disease \u2014 using a carnivore diet, then the diet clearly had a positive impact on physical or mental health and is not an eating disorder by definition.\"",
      "Overall, the researcher said, while a carnivore diet may be beneficial for some, it\u2019s not necessarily the best choice for everyone \u2014 \"and it doesn't mean that fiber or fruit is bad, or that someone else can't succeed on a plant-based or even a vegan diet.\" (Nick Norwitz)",
      "Instead, Norwitz said it should be considered an \"adaptive eating pattern.\"",
      "\"Not eating normally is not an eating disorder \u2014 in fact, I'd say standard American diet eating patterns could themselves reflect a form of eating disorder,\" he said.",
      "Myth No. 7: A meat-heavy diet is bad for the brain",
      "Following recent research that suggests red meat intake is linked to dementia, Norwitz said this data is \"misleading.\"",
      "The study in question lumped together different types of food, he noted, adding that there was \"tremendous healthy user bias.\"",

    "summary": "Security experts have discovered that hackers are targeting apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from saved screenshots.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson walks you through the process.",
      "Every tech expert will tell you the App Store is safer than Google Play Store. Some might even claim it is impossible to download a malicious app from the App Store, but they are wrong.",
      "While I admit the App Store is a secure and tightly controlled ecosystem, it cannot completely shield you. Security researchers have found that hackers are targeting several apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from screenshots saved on a device.",
      "The issue also affects those downloading apps from the Google Play Store.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S THE CYBERGUY REPORT NOW",
      "A person holding an iPhone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "How the malware works and what makes it different",
      "According to\u00a0researchers at Kaspersky, this malware campaign is more advanced than typical info stealers, both in how it works and how it spreads. Instead of relying on social engineering tricks to get users to grant permissions like most banking trojans or spyware, this malware hides inside seemingly legitimate apps and slips past Apple and Google\u2019s security checks.",
      "One of its standout features is Optical Character Recognition. Instead of stealing stored files, it scans screenshots saved on the device, extracts text and sends the information to remote servers.",
      "Once installed, the malware operates stealthily, often activating only after a period of dormancy to avoid raising suspicion. It employs encrypted communication channels to send stolen data back to its operators, making it difficult to trace. Plus, it spreads through deceptive updates or hidden code within app dependencies, an approach that helps it evade initial security screenings by app store review teams.",
      "The infection vectors vary between Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. On iOS, the malware is often embedded within apps that initially pass Apple\u2019s rigorous review process but later introduce harmful functionality through updates. On Android, the malware can exploit sideloading options, but even official Google Play apps have been found to carry these malicious payloads, sometimes hidden within SDKs (software development kits) supplied by third-party developers.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What's being stolen, and who's responsible?",
      "The scope of stolen information is alarming. This malware primarily targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but is also capable of exfiltrating login credentials, payment details, personal messages, location data and even biometric identifiers. Some versions are designed to harvest authentication tokens, allowing attackers to access accounts even if users change their passwords.",
      "The apps serving as malware carriers include ComeCome, ChatAi, WeTink, AnyGPT and more. These range from productivity tools to entertainment and utility apps. In some cases, malicious developers create these apps with full knowledge of the malware\u2019s purpose. In others, the issue appears to be a supply chain vulnerability, where legitimate developers unknowingly integrate compromised SDKs or third-party services that introduce malicious code into their applications.",
      "We reached out to Apple for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims. (Kaspersky)",
      "Apple's response to screenshot-scanning malware discovered in App Store",
      "Apple has removed the 11 iOS apps mentioned in Kaspersky's report from the App Store. Furthermore, they discovered that these 11 apps shared code signatures with 89 other iOS apps, all of which had been previously rejected or removed for violating Apple's policies, resulting in the termination of their developer accounts.",
      "Apps requesting access to user data such as Photos, Camera or Location must provide relevant functionality or face rejection. They must also clearly explain their data usage when prompting users for permission. iOS privacy features ensure users always control whether their location information is shared with an app. Also, starting in iOS 14, the PhotoKit API \u2014 which allows apps to request access to a user\u2019s Photos library \u2014 added additional controls to let users select only specific photos or videos to share with an app instead of providing access to their entire library.",
      "The App Store Review Guidelines mandate that developers are responsible for ensuring their entire app, including ad networks, analytics services and third-party SDKs, complies with the guidelines. Developers must carefully review and choose these components. Apps must also accurately represent their privacy practices, including those of the SDKs they use, in their privacy labels.",
      "In 2023, the App Store rejected over 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet its stringent privacy, security and content standards. It also rejected 248,000 app submissions found to be spam, copycats or misleading and prevented 84,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users.",

      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Installing strong antivirus software can add an extra layer of protection by scanning apps for malware, blocking suspicious activity and alerting you to potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Stick to trusted developers and well-known apps:\u00a0Even though malware has been found in official app stores, users can still minimize their risk by downloading apps from reputable developers with a long track record. Before installing an app, check its developer history, read multiple reviews and look at the permissions it requests. If an app from an unknown developer suddenly gains popularity but lacks a strong review history, approach it with caution.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully:\u00a0Many malicious apps disguise themselves as legitimate tools but request excessive permissions that go beyond their stated purpose. For example, a simple calculator app should not need access to your contacts, messages or location. If an app asks for permissions that seem unnecessary, consider it a red flag and either deny those permissions or avoid installing the app altogether. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android.",
      "4. Keep your device and apps updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to distribute malware. Always\u00a0keep your operating system and apps updated to the latest versions, as these updates often contain critical security patches. Enabling automatic updates ensures that you stay protected without having to manually check for new versions.",
      "5. Be wary of apps that promise too much:\u00a0Many malware-infected apps lure users by offering features that seem too good to be true \u2014 such as free premium services, extreme battery optimizations or AI-powered functionality that appears unrealistic. If an app\u2019s claims sound exaggerated or its download numbers skyrocket overnight with questionable reviews, it\u2019s best to avoid it. Stick to apps with a transparent development team and verifiable functionalities.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The new malware campaign highlights the need for stricter vetting processes, continuous monitoring of app behavior post-approval and greater transparency from app stores regarding security risks. While Apple and Google have removed the malicious apps upon detection, the fact that they made it onto the platform in the first place exposes a gap in the existing security framework. As cybercriminals refine their methods, app stores must evolve just as quickly or risk losing the trust of the very users they claim to protect.",

      "SpaceX's Starship exploded during an unmanned test flight. Debris from the explosion streaked through the sky, leaving people on the ground amazed and confused. (Greg Munch /TMX)",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) said Monday that its Euclid space telescope has detected a rare bright halo of light around a nearby galaxy.",
      "Known as an Einstein ring, the halo was captured in photos encircling a galaxy nearly 590 million light-years away, which is considered close by cosmic standards. A single light-year is measured at 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have known about the galaxy where the phenomenon was captured for over a century, they were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring,",
      "Euclid blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida on July 1, 2023, to begin a six-year mission to explore the dark universe.",
      "GIANT STELLAR NURSERY REVEALED IN NEW IMAGES FROM ESA'S SPACE TELESCOPE",
      "A sea of colorful stars and galaxies appear to swim in the vast blackness of space around a hazy halo at center stage. In the middle of the image, the fuzzy-looking bulb of light in a warm shade of yellow extends around a small bright spot, nestled within a thin light circle that appears to be drawn closely around it. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "But before the space telescope could begin its survey of the universe, scientists had to ensure everything onboard was working properly. During the early phase of testing, which took place in September 2023, Euclid sent images back to Earth.",
      "The ESA said the images were deliberately out of focus, but in one of the images, Euclid Archive Scientist Bruno Altieri saw what he believed was a very special phenomenon and decided to look at it a bit closer.",
      "\"I look at the data from Euclid as it comes in,\" Bruno said in a press release from the ESA. \"Even from that first observation, I could see it, but after Euclid made more observations of the area, we could see a perfect Einstein ring. For me, with a lifelong interest in gravitational lensing, that was amazing.\"",
      "For most of the population out there, an Einstein Ring is an \"extremely rare phenomenon,\" the ESA said.",
      "POWERFUL WEBB TELESCOPE SPIES SPECTACULAR STAR BIRTH CLUSTER BEYOND THE MILKY WAY",
      "A thin ring of a perfect circular shape and a piercingly bright white disc in its middle are the protagonists of this image. They stand out against a uniformly colored background of a hazy dark gray. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "When a distant galaxy is observed through a telescope, the light from that galaxy may encounter another galaxy on its way to the telescope. When that happens, the foreground galaxy acts like a magnifying glass, and gravity causes the traveling light rays to bend. When light rays bend, scientists call that gravitational lensing, according to the ESA.",
      "When the background galaxy, lensing galaxy and telescope are in perfect alignment, the image appears as a ring, also known as an Einstein Ring.",
      "The galaxy, called NGC 6506, is about 590 million light-years away, and this is the first time the ring of light around its center has ever been detected.",
      "\"All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically,\" Conor O\u2019Riordan of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said. \"This one is particularly special, because it\u2019s so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful.\"",
      "POWERFUL WEBB TELESCOPE CAPTURES PHOTOS OF ONE OF THE EARLIEST SUPERNOVA EVER SEEN",
      "The text paragraph explains the principle behind the Einstein rings. (ESA)",
      "Einstein rings are based on physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which predicts that light will bend around objects in space, so they focus the light like giant lenses, ESA said. The phenomenon allows scientists to sometimes see the light from distant galaxies that would otherwise be hidden.",
      "\"I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,\" Valeria Pettorino, ESA Euclid project scientist, said. \"The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.\"",
      "Over the course of the mission, scientists expect Euclid will reveal more about the role of gravity in the Universe, as well as the nature of dark energy and dark matter.",

      "Euclid will map over a third of the sky and observe billions of galaxies as far as 10 billion light-years away, ESA said. In doing so, scientists expect Euclid to find around 100,000 more strong lenses, though finding one so cosmically close to home and so spectacular, ESA added, \"is astonishing.\"",

      "If there is one corporation that is targeted by scammers more than anyone else, it is Microsoft. From customer support scams to impersonation and phishing attacks, the company\u2019s services are constantly under threat. Recently, even Russia-sponsored hackers managed to breach Microsoft and steal sensitive information.",
      "While Microsoft services as a whole are prime targets, one that stands out is Teams. The collaboration tool is used by more than 300 million people worldwide, making it a goldmine for attackers. Hackers are using it to spread\u00a0phishing,\u00a0vishing and\u00a0quishing campaigns, relying on social engineering tactics to trick victims into sharing private and sensitive data.",

      "The rising attacks on Microsoft Teams users",
      "Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting Microsoft Teams users with\u00a0sophisticated attack methods. One such technique involves malicious GIF images that exploit worm-like vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to take over accounts and infiltrate chat sessions when the image is opened.",
      "Hackers also insert malware-laden files into chat threads, tricking users into downloading DLL files that enable system takeover. Phishing campaigns leverage compromised accounts or domains to send deceptive invitations, luring victims into downloading harmful files.",
      "Some attackers use email bombing and vishing, posing as tech support to overwhelm users with spam emails before tricking them into granting remote access. Compromised email addresses and stolen Microsoft 365 credentials provide another entry point for unauthorized access.",
      "Plus, external access settings in Microsoft Teams, which often allow outside users to initiate chats or meetings, can be exploited if not properly restricted. Another common tactic is sending phishing links through Teams chats, often disguised as invoices or payment notifications, leading to ransomware infections.",

      "Scammers have been running fake job schemes for a while, but their tactics keep evolving. Lately, I reported how\u00a0fake job emails are being used to install crypto mining software that slows down computers. Now, they are using Microsoft Teams chat to trick people.",
      "It usually starts with an email about a job followed by a suggestion to do the interview over Teams. The first red flag is that the entire interview happens over chat with no video and no call. After that, you are \"hired\" and asked to submit your details, often through a Google Doc requesting personal info like your social security or tax number. Some victims are even asked to buy equipment for the job, pay a hiring fee or purchase gift cards, which are classic signs that the whole thing is a scam.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from scammers targeting Microsoft Teams",
      "1) Avoid opening suspicious links and attachments: Be cautious of unsolicited links or attachments, especially in chat messages or emails. Cybercriminals often use these to deliver malware or phishing links. Never click on links that seem unusual or come from unknown sources.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Check for red flags in job offers: If you receive a job offer that seems too good to be true or involves an interview conducted entirely via chat with no phone call or video meeting, it's likely a scam. Legitimate companies typically conduct interviews using multiple forms of communication.",
      "A job offer that insists on only text-based conversations is a major red flag. Other warning signs include being asked to provide personal information through Google Docs, being asked to pay for equipment, paying fees to secure the job or purchasing gift cards as part of the hiring process.",
      "3) Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure your Microsoft 365 and other accounts are protected with strong passwords. Consider using\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. Also, you might want to use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive personal details, like social security numbers or tax information, through unsecured or unsolicited channels, such as Google Docs or messages on Teams. Always verify the legitimacy of such requests.",
      "5) Report suspicious activity: If you notice any suspicious activity on your Microsoft Teams account or receive unusual job offers, report it immediately. Prompt action can prevent a potential breach or further compromise. Notify your IT department or relevant authorities so they can investigate and take appropriate measures.",
      "6) Verify IT support requests: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls claiming to be from IT support, especially those asking you to install software or grant remote access. Cybercriminals often impersonate IT staff to deploy ransomware or steal sensitive data. Always verify such requests with your actual IT department before taking any action. If in doubt, contact your IT team directly using official channels, not through the message or call you received.",
      "ENERGY-SAVING SCAM USES ELON MUSK\u2019S NAME \u2013 HERE\u2019S THE TRUTH",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers and hackers are not slowing down, so staying sharp is the only way to stay ahead. If something feels off, like a job that sounds too good to be true, a random Teams message with a sketchy link or an interview that is just a chat, trust your instincts. You should always be careful with external messages and invites that you to receive on Microsoft Teams. Even if it seems like it is from someone you know, it is best to double-check, especially if it involves a file, a link or an invitation to a chat you were not expecting to receive.",

      "2. Turn off ad personalization:\u00a0Many companies track your online activity to show targeted ads. You can limit this by disabling ad personalization in\u00a0Google,\u00a0Facebook, and other accounts. This reduces the amount of data collected about your interests and behavior.",
      "3. Limit social media tracking:\u00a0Social media platforms track your activity even when you are not using them.\u00a0Adjust privacy settings to restrict data collection.",
      "4. Avoid signing in with Google or Facebook:\u00a0Many websites offer login options using Google or Facebook. While convenient, this shares even more data with these platforms. Instead, create separate accounts using email whenever possible.",
      "5. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and private browsing mode:\u00a0A\u00a0VPN hides your IP address, helping to obscure your location and online activity, making it harder for websites to track you. Combined with private browsing or incognito mode, this reduces the amount of data companies can collect about your online activity. Using a VPN service can also enhance your privacy by encrypting your internet traffic, making it harder for hackers and third parties to intercept your data, especially on public Wi-Fi.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The best way to reduce companies from collecting your data is to remove invasive apps from your phone. Many apps request unnecessary permissions that can track your activity, so deleting them limits exposure. Instead of downloading standalone apps, try using the browser versions of popular social media platforms, as they typically have fewer permissions.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "However, web tracking still exists through cookies and fingerprinting, so using a\u00a0privacy-focused browser like Brave, Firefox with enhanced tracking protection, or Safari with Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) can further reduce data collection. However, some apps are so deeply integrated that replacing them is difficult. For example, if you use an Android phone, avoiding Google\u2019s ecosystem is nearly impossible. Apple, on the other hand, offers more privacy controls, giving users better options to limit data collection.",

      "The healthcare industry has recently been a major target for hackers. You might remember the 2024 Ascension attack, which led to significant disruptions.",
      "The Change Healthcare breach was also on a massive scale. UnitedHealth initially\u00a0claimed that 100 million Americans were affected, but later\u00a0raised that number to 190 million.",
      "There have been countless other incidents, and now you can add another to the list. Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC), a Connecticut-based federally qualified health center, has disclosed a data breach following a criminal cyberattack on its systems.",

      "What You Need to Know",
      "Community Health Center, Inc. (CHC)\u00a0detected a data breach on Jan. 2 after identifying unusual activity within its computer systems. An investigation confirmed that a skilled hacker had accessed and extracted data but did not delete or lock any information. If CHC's claims are accurate, this is a positive outcome, as hackers often deploy ransomware, a type of attack in which they lock systems and demand payment before restoring access.",
      "In a\u00a0regulatory filing with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s Office, CHC said that 1,060,936 people were affected by the data breach. The type of information compromised varies depending on an individual\u2019s relationship with CHC. Patient data that may have been accessed includes names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, diagnoses, treatment details, test results, Social Security numbers and health insurance information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "For individuals who are not regular CHC patients but received COVID-19 services at a CHC clinic, the breached data may include names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, addresses, gender, race, ethnicity and insurance details if provided. Additional information, such as test dates, results and vaccine details, including type, dose and administration date, may also have been affected. In rare cases, Social Security numbers were also included in the breach.",
      "The organization did not disclose how the hackers gained access to the data or whether proper cybersecurity measures were in place at the time of the breach. While CHC has assured that its systems are no longer at risk, the same cannot be said for its patients, who may now be targets of various cyberattacks.",

      "1. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0The breach has exposed sensitive personal data, making it essential to reduce your online footprint. While no service can guarantee complete data removal, a reputable data removal service can significantly limit your exposure. These services systematically monitor and erase your personal information from numerous websites and data brokers.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With addresses among the compromised data, scammers may exploit this breach to send fraudulent letters. Be aware of mail claiming\u00a0missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Always verify the authenticity of such communications before responding or taking action.",
      "3. Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: Scammers may use your compromised email or phone number to target you with\u00a0phishing attacks. Be wary of messages asking for personal information or containing suspicious links. To protect yourself, ensure strong antivirus software is installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, regular monitoring of your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts is critical. Look for unauthorized transactions or suspicious activity, and report any issues immediately to your bank or credit card provider.",
      "5. Recognize and report a Social Security scam:\u00a0If your Social Security number is exposed, you could become a target for related scams. Official communication regarding Social Security issues usually comes via mail, not phone calls or emails. Learn more about spotting and reporting scams by visiting the Social Security Administration\u2019s\u00a0scam information page.",
      "6. Invest in identity theft protection: Data breaches happen every day, and most never make the headlines, but with an identity theft protection service, you\u2019ll be notified if and when you are affected. An identity theft protection service can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using an identity theft protection service is that it might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The CHC breach may not be as large as the UnitedHealth attack, but with over a million individuals affected, it\u2019s still a serious incident. Cybercriminals can exploit stolen data in various ways, from identity theft to targeted phishing scams. While CHC has taken steps to secure its systems, those impacted should remain vigilant. Be wary of unexpected emails, calls or messages requesting personal information, and consider monitoring financial and medical accounts for any suspicious activity.",

    "story": [
      "Danon officially informed members of the Security Council that Israel will cease its cooperation with UNRWA on January 30th. ( Video: UNTV.)",
      "UNITED NATIONS - President Donald Trump has made major foreign policy moves in his first few weeks in office, including cutting off U.S. funding to the controversial United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). UNRWA has long faced accusations of ties to terrorists, which have intensified over the course of the Israel-Hamas war that began with the massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Former President Joe Biden initially cut off U.S. funding to UNRWA in January 2024, months into the war, after Israel accused members of the U.N. agency of taking part in Hamas\u2019 brutal attacks.",
      "U.N. Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer said Americans need to know that some U.N. agencies, such as UNRWA, are founded on \"altruistic good intentions,\" but have \"morphed into something which is the complete opposite of what it was supposed to be.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has cut off U.S. funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East. (Getty)",
      "DAYS BEFORE TRUMP HALTED FUNDING, AN EX-ISRAELI HOSTAGE WAS HELD AT UNRWA SCHOOL IN GAZA, SHE REVEALS",
      "UNRWA was founded in 1949 \"to carry out direct relief and works programs for Palestine refugees,\" according to the agency\u2019s website. However, Neuer disputes Palestinians\u2019 refugee status and says that President Trump\u2019s proposed Gaza takeover uncovered a \"truth that has been hidden.\"",
      "Neuer points out that UNRWA supporters and critics of the president\u2019s proposal have accused Trump of \"uprooting them [Palestinians] from their homes and lands,\" which would mean that \"they\u2019re not refugees.\" Gaza, which the U.N. recognizes as part of the \"State of Palestine,\" would be considered their home under this criticism, negating their refugee status.",
      "However, the problems with UNRWA go beyond ambiguous definitions. Neuer told Fox News Digital that the agency \"systematically employed individuals who were supporting terrorism.\" He pointed to Fathi al-Sharif, who served as the principal of a school run by UNRWA, as well as the agency\u2019s teachers\u2019 union in Lebanon.",
      "\"We know that the head of UNRWA's education system, namely, teacher, school principal and head of the teachers\u2019 union of 2,000 teachers in Lebanon, was a man named Fathi al-Sharif\u2026 he was the head of Hamas in Lebanon,\" Neuer said, adding that American taxpayers\u2019 money funded al-Sharif and \"the entire education system that he oversaw.\"",
      "In the case of Suhail al-Hindi, UNRWA\u2019s former head of a \"local staff union in Gaza,\" the agency insists that it suspended and fired al-Hindi after an announcement that he had been \"elected to political office with Hamas.\"",
      "In response to a request for comment, UNRWA told Fox News Digital that it \"prohibits any type of involvement of staff in a militant or armed group. As a representative of the U.N., any involvement in a group that promotes discrimination or violence violates the principle of neutrality and gravely jeopardizes UNRWA\u2019s ability to provide services and protection to refugees.\"",
      "UNRWA referenced al-Hindi's case specifically, noting it \"also dismissed another staff member whose name appeared in the list of those newly elected to Hamas political office in Gaza.\"",
      "Contrary to critics\u2019 claims, Neuer told Fox News Digital that Israel was not always trying to shut down UNRWA, saying that the Jewish State first saw the agency as \"convenient\" in the late 1960s. However, Neuer said that Israel\u2019s view on the agency has greatly shifted, particularly since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attacks.",

      "In January 2024, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini ordered an investigation of any staff who allegedly participated in Hamas' attacks, which he condemned in a statement. UNRWA told Fox News Digital that \"upon ascertaining that the individuals were indeed UNRWA staff members,\" Lazzarini \"immediately\" terminated their appointments.",
      "Late last month, Israeli Ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon formally notified U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres of Israel\u2019s demand that UNRWA cease operations in Jerusalem and evacuate its premises.",
      "\"Months of good-faith engagement with the United Nations and years of related grievances conveyed to UNRWA, have been met with blatant disregard, compromising its fundamental obligation to impartiality and neutrality beyond repair,\" Danon wrote in the letter.",
      "In a statement released last month, UNRWA spokesperson Jonathan Fowler slammed the laws that Israel passed in October 2024, saying that the Jewish State\u2019s shortening of UNRWA staff visas was \"tantamount to being evicted.\" However, Fowler confirmed that \"UNRWA remains absolutely committed to stay and deliver,\" referring to the agency\u2019s other locations in the region.",
      "While Israel\u2019s views on the agency have changed, prompting action from the country\u2019s government, Neuer points out that several countries, including the U.S., failed to \"take any meaningful action\" against UNRWA. He called the countries\u2019 past moves \"largely performative and limited.\"",
      "A protester holds a flag outside the United Nations Relief and Works Agency during the demonstration. (Ahmed Zakot/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "When asked about what Americans need to know about UNRWA, Neuer says that the agency is \"a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing,\" adding examples of U.N. officials who he says have gone against their mission. He also compared it to a social issue commonly debated here, namely anti-racism.",
      "\"Just like Americans were told for at least the past 5 years - maybe more - that anti-racism means you have to discriminate against white people, against heterosexuals, you know, all kinds of categories, we were told that's tolerance, that's equality. We were told that racism and discrimination was anti-racism and anti-discrimination. We were fed a pack of lies,\" Neuer told Fox News Digital.",
      "Addressing UNRWA and the U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Neuer added, \"They are no humanitarian agencies. They are agencies that systematically have incentivized and legitimized terrorist groups from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the Islamic regime in Iran. That's the reality.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's administration began a mass firing of federal workers Thursday.",
      "Office of Personnel Management officials met with agency leaders and advised them to dismiss probationary employees, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people could be affected, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management, although the exact number of people who will be terminated was not immediately clear.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here.",
      "Employees who have probationary status have typically been with the federal government for only one or two years \u2014 before all their civil service protections have kicked in.",
      "\"The probationary period is a continuation of the job application process, not an entitlement for permanent employment,\" an OPM spokesperson said in a statement. \"Agencies are taking independent action in light of the recent hiring freeze and in support of the President\u2019s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government to better serve the American people at the highest possible standard.\"",
      "The American Federation of Government Employees, a union for federal workers, condemned the move. AFGE President Everett Kelley said in a statement that the administration \u201chas abused the probationary period to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese firings are not about poor performance \u2014 there is no evidence these employees were anything but dedicated public servants. They are about power,\u201d Kelley continued. \u201cThey are about gutting the federal government, silencing workers, and forcing agencies into submission to a radical agenda that prioritizes cronyism over competence.\u201d",
      "The exact extent of the firings is unclear. The Department of Veterans Affairs announced on Thursday that it was dismissing more than 1,000 employees, including certain probationary employees. The total number of probationary employees across the department is over 43,000, but the \"vast majority\" of the probationary employees \"are exempt from today\u2019s personnel actions because they serve in mission-critical positions \u2014 primarily those supporting benefits and services for VA beneficiaries \u2014 or are covered under a collective bargaining agreement,\" the VA said in a press release.",
      "The Education Department began terminating dozens of probationary employees on Wednesday. At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, senior-level managers were told in meetings who on their teams would be cut. They were also told to expect up to a 50% reduction in workforce at the housing agency, according to two HUD employees. The U.S. Forest Service is planning to terminate at least 3,400 people, according to Dennis Lapcewich, communications chair for the National Federation of Federal Employees\u2019 Forest Service Council.",
      "The move comes after an OPM spokesperson said Wednesday that about 75,000 federal employees accepted the White House\u2019s \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d offer to leave their roles but be paid through September. NBC News cannot independently verify the number.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump administration has taken aim at the U.S. Agency For International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Thousands of institutional support contractors at USAID were fired or placed on leave this month.",
      "Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has promised to slash what he and Trump paint as wasteful spending.",
      "On the first day of his second term, Trump declared a hiring freeze, meaning that vacant federal civilian positions could not be filled, nor could the government create new positions in most cases. The freeze has faced some legal challenges, with a federal appeals court on Tuesday rejecting the Trump administration's bid to pause a lower court's order that temporarily halted the federal funding freeze."

    "summary": "Some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar, Thailand\u2019s army said.",
    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 Some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar, Thailand\u2019s army announced Thursday.",
      "In a fresh crackdown on scam centers operating from Southeast Asia, the Thai army said it was coordinating an effort to repatriate some 260 people believed to have been victims of human trafficking after they were rescued and sent from Myanmar to Thailand.",
      "Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have become known as havens for criminal syndicates that are estimated to have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have extracted tens of billions of dollars from victims around the world, according to U.N. experts, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023 after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state along its border. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.",
      "The army said that those rescued in the most recent operation came from 20 nationalities \u2014 with significant numbers from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan and China. There were also nationals of Indonesia, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, Laos, Brazil, Burundi, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana and India. They were sent across the border from Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy district to Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Wednesday.",
      "Reports in Thai media said a Myanmar ethnic militia that controls the area where they were held, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, was responsible for freeing the workers and taking them to the border. Myanmar\u2019s military government exercises little control over frontier areas where ethnic minorities predominate.",
      "Several ethnic militias are believed to be involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking and protecting call-center scam operations.",
      "The Thai army statement said the rescued people will undergo questioning, and if determined to be victims of human trafficking, will enter a process of protection while waiting to be sent back to their countries.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who is also defense minister, said Wednesday that there might be many more scam workers waiting to be repatriated from Myanmar through Thailand, but that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their country of origin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that Thailand is not going to set up another shelter,\u201d he told reporters during a visit in Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. Thailand hosts nine refugee camps along the border holding more than 100,000 people, most from Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Karen minority.",
      "Phumtham added that Thailand would also need to question them before sending them back, both to make sure that they are victims of human trafficking, and also to get information that would help the police investigate the trafficking and scam problems.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks that plague Southeast Asia.",
      "Many dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Bangkok only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar have surfaced. Chinese actor Wang Xing was a high-profile case but was quickly rescued after his tale spread on social media.",
      "Underlining Beijing\u2019s concern, Liu Zhongyi, China\u2019s vice minister of public security and commissioner of its Criminal Investigation Bureau, made an official visit to Thailand last month and inspected the border area opposite where many of the Myanmar scam centers are located.",
      "Just ahead of Paetongtarn\u2019s visit to China, the Thai government issued an order to cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border with northern Thailand, citing national security and severe damage that the country has suffered from scam operations.",
      "Her government is considering expanding this measure to Thailand\u2019s northeastern areas bordering Cambodia, said Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Thanathip Sawangsang, who explained that officials had already removed internet cables that were installed in the areas illegally."

      "During a\u00a0Q&A in January, fans\u00a0threatened to boycott the film and Mackie\u00a0because of his comments on what he thinks Captain America represents that some deemed unpatriotic.",
      "\u201cCaptain America represents a lot of different things, and I don\u2019t think the term \u2018America\u2019 should be one of those representations. It\u2019s about a man who keeps his word and who has honor, dignity, and integrity. Someone who is trustworthy and dependable. This is like an aspect of a dream coming true,\u201d the actor said at the time.",
      "Following the backlash, Mackie has since clarified his comments online and in interviews, saying he\u2019s a\u00a0\u201cproud American,\u201d\u00a0and that Captain America is \u201cimportant for kids of all races\u201d so they can have someone to look up to regardless of their race.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about some fans\u2019 mixed reaction following the first\u00a0teaser\u00a0of him as Cap, Mackie, 46, says he wasn\u2019t \u201caware\u201d that a Black Captain America had become so controversial.\u201cI think that\u2019s funny, because we all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America,\u201d Mackie says pragmatically.",
      "Though Mackie says he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any hesitations\u201d taking on the role in the MCU, Waid \u2014 who introduced the idea of Falcon becoming the first Black Captain America in the comics \u2014 admits there was \u201ca little bit of resistance\u201d from Marvel when he pitched it in the \u201890s.",
      "\u201cNot because anybody disbelieved the message,\u201d Waid, 62, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNot because anybody at Marvel was on the wrong side of history here, but just because when you\u2019re dealing with a corporate character like that it\u2019s going to go through many creators hands over his 80 years of existence.\u201d",
      "But Waid\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t just to make sure the comic\u2019s core readers were satisfied, it was also to authentically portray the Black experience. To do this, the comic book writer says he spoke to his real-life Black friends who made him see a different perspective of America, which included sentiments of \u201cracial hatred\u201d and \u201cbigotry.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018There is more of this going on than you realize \u2026 so just be mindful of that as you go into the story,\u2019\u201d he recalls them saying.",
      "Within Marvel, Waid says his story of Falcon taking on the mantle of Captain America \u201cwas very well received.\u201d But externally, he says there was \u201ca little bit of pushback\u201d from fandom and readers, with some saying, \u2018\u2018Well, this is not Captain America. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d",
      "Looking back, Waid says the pushback by fans wasn\u2019t so severe that he recalls \u201creceiving any hate mail\u201d about it. But he suspects that if he had done this story today, \u201cpeople would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Waid notes that over the last 10 to 15 years, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot more trolling, a lot more blow back. A lot of organized fandom full of angry white guys who are not happy that they are being quote, unquote, eclipsed by people of color, which is bulls--t.\u201d",
      "The tenured comic book writer says it comes as no surprise that some fans are upset and even threatening to boycott Marvel\u2019s TV shows and the movies, because \u201cthese are the same people who were up in arms about the comics.\u201d\u00a0\u201cLuckily, they have been a small enough part of the audience where we didn\u2019t have to take them into account,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we lost tons of sales because these trolls were out there being actively, performatively angry about the replacement of Captain America by a Black man in a comic book. They weren\u2019t buying the comics anyway. They were just looking for something to be mad about.\u201d",
      "Waid\u2019s introduction of Sam Wilson (Falcon) as Captain America in the comic \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty #9\u201d unfolds in a time of \u201cgreat racial divide\u201d in America.",
      "Steve Rogers (Captain America) is trying to disassociate himself from white supremacists (Sons of Serpents) who are co-opting his name and image because they believe that Cap represents their cause, Waid explains.",
      "\u201c\u2018He\u2019s a blonde white guy with a strong jaw. He\u2019s showing you that this is what America should be,\u2019\u201d he says of their sentiments toward Rogers \u2014 who, during his fight to stop them, appears to get killed. It\u2019s at this juncture that \u201cSam Wilson realizes that someone has to pick up the mantle, someone has to pick up the shield, and someone has to fight to clear the name of Captain America.\u201d",
      "While the film is not exactly like the comics, there are similarities. The\u00a0film follows Falcon\u2019s fight to uncover a villainous plot against President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) while also helping to exonerate Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) \u2014 a war vet who is turned into a Super Soldier after undergoing human testings by the government \u2014 who was accused of being involved. Some fans have\u00a0argued that Bradley is the first Black Captain America\u00a0since he took the Super Solider serum like Cap. Mackie says Sam\u2019s sense of integrity and dedication to justice is what he leans into and tries to embody with his titular role.",
      "\u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us,\u201d Mackie tells TODAY.com. \u201cSam didn\u2019t take the (Super Soldier) serum. Sam isn\u2019t a Super Soldier. He\u2019s just a good human being, and I think that\u2019s why we all kind of are endeared to him and kind of appreciate him, because we can see the best of us in him.\u201d",
      "Since its\u00a0first publication in March 1941, Waid says Captain America has had a simple, altruistic purpose: he represented the American dream and showed that it was attainable. But he says Cap\u2019s mission has \u201cchanged\u201d over the years.",
      "\u201cAmerica was the land of opportunity,\u201d Waid tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd clearly it has not always been that way for some people \u2026 And I think that Captain America today stands for equality. He stands for making sure that anyone in this country has an opportunity at bettering themselves and has an opportunity to have the best life possible \u2014 if they\u2019re willing to put the work into it.\u201d",
      "And Anthony Mackie\u00a0has\u00a0put that work in with his over two decades in Hollywood and 10 years playing Sam Wilson. Still, even with his tenure, there will still be those who take issue with there being a Black Captain America.",
      "Mackie even gave a nod to the pressure of taking on Cap\u2019s mantle in the film. In an exchange with President Ross following the attack on his life, Mackie\u2019s Sam tells the president that he overwhelmingly understands what he\u2019s going through.",
      "\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to feel you have something to prove,\u201d he says.",
      "Later in the film, Mackie is seen grappling with his past decision to reject the Super Soldier serum and also the pressure that he\u2019s under if he fails his mission.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m not on point, I let everyone who wants a seat at that table down,\u201d he says to his First Lieutenant Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), who takes on Sam\u2019s former mantle of Falcon. \u201cThat\u2019s pressure. It makes you feel that you\u2019re not enough.\u201d",
      "The \u201cCaptain America\u201d comic book writer says there\u2019s always been room\u00a0for the character to change, evolve and represent something more inclusive.",
      "\u201cCaptain America can be an Asian man. Captain America can be a woman. Captain America could be anyone who stands for the ideals that Captain America stands for,\u201d Waid explains, noting that he hopes Cap\u2019s fight eventually \u201cgets easier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs long as they\u2019re an American at heart and fight for the American way \u2026 the way we wish truly was the dream as opposed to what racism and bigotry has sort of poisoned that well.\u201d",
      "Mackie agrees, noting that his Captain America leads with two important things: \u201cCompassion and empathy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like today, we could all use a little compassion and empathy,\u201d he adds."

      "The page used to say \"LGBTQ+,\" according to an archived version\u00a0of the National Park Service's website. It now only says \"LGB.\"",
      "Stacy Lentz, co-owner of the Stonewall Inn and the chief executive of the nonprofit Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative, said the Trump administration was trying to \"erase trans people from history and from existing.\"  A protest is scheduled for noon on Friday.",

      "In a joint statement, the Stonewall Inn and the Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative said it was \"outraged.\"",
      "\"This blatant act of erasure not only distorts the truth of our history, but it also dishonors the immense contributions of transgender individuals - especially transgender women of color - who were at the forefront of the Stonewall Riots and the broader fight for LGBTQ+ rights,\" the statement read.",
      "\"Let us be clear: Stonewall is transgender history. Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and countless other trans and gender-nonconforming individuals fought bravely, and often at great personal risk to push against oppressive systems,\" it continued. \"Their courage, sacrifice, and leadership were central to the resistance we now celebrate as the foundation of the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement.\"",
      "The statement said removing the word transgender is an attempt to marginalize the people who fought for change in the community. They called it a \"direct attack on transgender people\" and demanded the word be added back to the website."

      "Fragrance brand Brown Girl Jane\u2019s perfume bottles sit on shelves at Sephora near some of the most storied labels in the fashion and beauty world, including Prada and Dior.",
      "For the Black-owned brand, getting a retailer to bet on it was just the start, Brown Girl Jane CEO and co-founder Malaika Jones said. She said Sephora has supported the company so it can better compete with well-known brands with huge marketing budgets and glossy celebrity endorsements.",
      "Brown Girl Jane got a $100,000 grant last year to help grow its business through\u00a0Sephora\u2019s Accelerate\u00a0program, which aims to boost founders who are people of color. Sephora spotlighted the fragrance brand in an email to customers in early February, putting it\u00a0in front of potential shoppers who don\u2019t know its name. Brown Girl Jane\u2019s sales more than doubled after Sephora began carrying the company\u2019s fragrances online and at select stores about a year ago.",
      "While Sephora has put its weight behind its brand incubator, much larger retailers like\u00a0Walmart\u00a0and\u00a0Target\u00a0recently scaled back similar efforts focused on finding and funding more brands founded by people of color.\u00a0Without that support from the retailers themselves, brands like Brown Girl Jane could face a tougher time getting on shelves \u2014 and succeeding once they get there.",
      "\u201cFor small brands, but for any brands, really, it\u2019s a constant fight for relevance and for visibility,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd so when you don\u2019t have that commitment or even that understanding from the retailer side, it becomes quite difficult for small brands to survive \u2014 even when they\u2019ve made it on shelves.\u201d",
      "When retailers launched supplier diversity programs \u2014 many of them in the months after police killed George Floyd in 2020 \u2014 top industry leaders including\u00a0Walmart CEO Doug McMillon\u00a0and\u00a0Target CEO Brian Cornell\u00a0spoke out about the institutional barriers that\u00a0people of color face, including when financing their businesses. Now, as more retailers drop diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Black-owned brands may find it harder to clear those hurdles.",
      "In January, Target\u00a0dropped specific DEI pledges\u00a0that it made four years ago after Floyd was murdered a short distance from its Minneapolis headquarters. Among those goals, the big-box retailer had\u00a0committed\u00a0to adding products\u00a0from more than 500 Black-owned brands to its shelves or website and\u00a0spending $2 billion\u00a0with Black-owned businesses by 2025.",
      "Late last year, Walmart confirmed that it was ending key diversity initiatives, including winding down the Center for Racial Equity,\u00a0a nonprofit that the retailer started and funded with $100 million to tackle racial inequities.

      "Not every major retailer has dropped DEI initiatives. Sephora,\u00a0Costco\u00a0and\u00a0E.l.f. Beauty, among others, have reaffirmed their commitments. And the most prominent effort to increase the share of Black-owned brands on retail shelves, the 15 Percent Pledge, still has major backers.",
      "A larger retreat",
      "Companies from\u00a0Google\u00a0to\u00a0Ford\u00a0and\u00a0Tractor Supply\u00a0have\u00a0rolled back their initiatives\u00a0to boost representation of people of color, women and LGBTQ+ people, as political backlash and pressure from conservative activists has intensified. The trend only accelerated after\u00a0President Donald Trump issued an executive order\u00a0banning DEI programs in the federal government\u00a0and describing the efforts as \u201cdangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a sharp change from about five years ago, when companies released a wave of announcements committing to fighting inequity. They made bold pledges to add more diversity to their workforces and C-suites, seek out Black and minority vendors and donate to philanthropic causes that fought racism and supported\u00a0expanded opportunities for marginalized groups.",
      "Fear of litigation, activist investor scrutiny and political pressure has caused companies to backpedal or keep their initiatives below the radar, said Jon Solorzano, an attorney at Vinson & Elkins who advises companies on DEI.",
      "One of those lawsuits targeted The Fearless Fund, an Atlanta-based venture capital fund dedicated to awarding grants to businesses founded by Black women to bridge a longstanding funding gap. Only 1.3% of the more than $345 billion raised by venture-backed startups in 2021 went to Black founders, according to\u00a0Deloitte and Venture Forward\u2019s 2023 report. About 2.4% went to startups led by female founders and 2.1% of that total went to startups led by Hispanic founders.",
      "American Alliance for Equal Rights, a conservative group founded by Edward Blum, sued The Fearless Fund in 2023, accusing it of discriminating against non-Black business owners. Blum previously fought against race-based college admissions, a campaign that led to\u00a0the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling\u00a0that affirmative action policies are unconstitutional \u2014 which some companies cited last year in ending their DEI initiatives.",
      "As part of a settlement reached last year, The Fearless Fund shut down its grant program.",
      "Solorzano said that lawsuit had a chilling effect and will \u201cseriously undermine some of these [supplier] initiatives.\u201d He said he expects more corporations to scrub numbers from their diversity programs, including supplier programs focused on increasing Black- and minority-owned brands on shelves.",
      "Yet ending or scaling back efforts to seek out merchandise that reflects the diversity of U.S. consumers could put a company at risk, too, he said. Not only could companies face boycotts, but also they could miss out on fresher items and brands that help them stand apart from competitors.",
      "The companies standing firm",
      "Even as some retailers walk back diversity pledges, Sephora,\u00a0Costco\u00a0and\u00a0E.l.f. Beauty, have doubled down on those efforts not as a feel-good move, but as a meaningful part of their business strategies.",

      "Sephora started Accelerate in 2016 with a focus on female founders. The six-month incubator helps mentor business owners, connects them to investors and gives them the opportunity to launch at Sephora.",

      "And Macy\u2019s, another 15 Percent Pledge participant, has had an accelerator for over a decade which was launched to support underrepresented brand owners and founders. The Workshop, which started in 2011, offers grant funding and education for companies seeking to make it on retailers\u2019 shelves and websites.",
      "James, who herself is a Black founder of a luxury brand called Brother Vellies, said she\u2019s disheartened to see companies back away from supporting smaller Black- and minority-owned suppliers.",
      "\u201cThe idea is not about giving preferential treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is about making sure that we cast our net wide enough that we\u2019re not just looking at the obvious channels.\u201d",
      "By relying more on big conglomerates, retailers miss out on funding smaller U.S. business that create jobs and stimulate the local economy, she said.",
      "\u201cIn a time when I think small business all across America is suffering, to specifically target groups of founders and say, \u2018You can\u2019t get access or opportunity,\u2019 just feels like a blow to all small businesses across America,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cTarget never took the pledge. Walmart never took the pledge,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that they were ever really that serious about what they were doing.\u201d",
      "Not every company has stuck with the pledge.\u00a0Gap\u00a0did not renew with the group late last year \u2014 but said in a statement that it\u2019s not backing away from DEI efforts. Over the past year, the company has gone through major changes as part of a turnaround led by\u00a0Richard Dickson, its new CEO.",
      "In a statement, the denim and apparel retailer, which also includes Old Navy and Athleta, said the pledge looked different for the company because it sells and manufacturers its own brands. It said it \u201cjoined the\u00a0pledge with the goal of increasing our diverse access and pipeline programs, and we met and exceeded that goal.\u201d",

      "Risks for Black founders",
      "Walmart and Target have downplayed concerns that they will start to carry fewer Black-owned brands.

She said the company also works with banks and lenders to expedite payments for orders or connect suppliers to loans.",
      "Even as Target phases out DEI goals for Black-owned businesses, the discounter will keep offering Black-owned and minority-owned brands, a spokesman said. On its website, it\u2019s promoting its collection of Black History Month items. He said Target will offer its\u00a0Forward Founders\u00a0program two times per year, which is designed for early-stage consumer packaged goods companies across categories including beauty, food and pets.",
      "When Target\u00a0launched Forward Founders\u00a0in 2021, the company said the program was \u201cdesigned to help Black-owned businesses increase their potential for long-term success in retail.\u201d",
      "Since last year, Target\u2019s website has said the program is \u201cevolving\u201d \u2014\u00a0noting that founders no longer fill out an application for programs and Target will reach out to them if they\u2019re \u201ca strategic fit.\u201d\u00a0A spokesman said the company\u2019s changes to its DEI initiatives do not affect its programs to boost founders, but did not offer more detail.",

      "In\u00a0an Instagram post, social media personality, actress, and entrepreneur Tabitha Brown said \u201cit\u2019s definitely heartbreaking to feel unsupported.\u201d But Brown, who has an active contract with Target, encouraged shoppers to use their dollars strategically when shopping Target\u2019s shelves.",

      "His brand took off in 2020 during the Black Lives Matter movement, after he made a tote decorated with three words instead of a logo: \u201cEnd Systemic Racism.\u201d The bag gained traction through social media.",
      "Yet he said major retailers that picked up handbags from his brand at the time, including Neiman Marcus, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Nordstrom, \u201chelped put my product in front of a lot of people that wouldn\u2019t necessarily have seen it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat really helped us and that really helped our brand awareness,\u201d he said.",

    "summary": "Anthony Mackie and Mark Waid, the comic book writer who introduced the idea of the first Black Captain America, discuss the controversy surround the superhero.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Mackie taking on the role of Captain America, a fictional comic book character initially portrayed as a white man with blond hair and blue eyes, isn\u2019t groundbreaking to comic books fans.",
      "The idea of a Black man as the patriotic superhero was introduced in 1998 by writer Mark Waid in the comic book \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty,\u201d where, according to Waid, Sam Wilson first \u201cpicked up the costume and took on the identity of Captain America.\u201d",
      "Over two decades after Sam Wilson became Cap in the comics, a Black Captain America in the movie adaptations has turned into a contentious topic.",
      "The issue of a Black Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe first arose after Chris Evans, who portrayed Cap on-screen for eight years, passed the mantle on to Mackie\u2019s Falcon in 2019\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d Fans were upset with Evans\u2019 departure and some felt Mackie wasn\u2019t capable of taking on the superpowered role.",
      "Though some eventually warmed up to the idea after seeing him in the 2021 critically acclaimed Disney+ series, \u201cFalcon and the Winter Soldier,\u201d where Mackie\u2019s Falcon grapples with the complicated notion of what it means for a Black man to be Captain America, the vitriol against actor ramped back up during his press run for \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World.\u201d",
      "During a Q&A in January, fans threatened to boycott the film and Mackie because of his comments on what he thinks Captain America represents that some deemed unpatriotic.",
      "\u201cCaptain America represents a lot of different things, and I don\u2019t think the term \u2018America\u2019 should be one of those representations. It\u2019s about a man who keeps his word and who has honor, dignity, and integrity. Someone who is trustworthy and dependable. This is like an aspect of a dream coming true,\u201d the actor said at the time.",
      "Following the backlash, Mackie has since clarified his comments online and in interviews, saying he\u2019s a \u201cproud American,\u201d and that Captain America is \u201cimportant for kids of all races\u201d so they can have someone to look up to regardless of their race.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about some fans\u2019 mixed reaction following the first teaser of him as Cap, Mackie, 46, says he wasn\u2019t \u201caware\u201d that a Black Captain America had become so controversial.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s funny, because we all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America,\u201d Mackie says pragmatically.",
      "Though Mackie says he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any hesitations\u201d taking on the role in the MCU, Waid \u2014 who introduced the idea of Falcon becoming the first Black Captain America in the comics \u2014 admits there was \u201ca little bit of resistance\u201d from Marvel when he pitched it in the '90s.",
      "\u201cNot because anybody disbelieved the message,\u201d Waid, 62, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNot because anybody at Marvel was on the wrong side of history here, but just because when you\u2019re dealing with a corporate character like that it\u2019s going to go through many creators hands over his 80 years of existence.\u201d",
      "We all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America.\u201d",
      "Anthony mackie",
      "Captain America was first created in 1941 during World War II. Since then, an array of people have held the role in the comics, including women and people of color, like Sam Wilson.",
      "Waid explains that Marvel wanted him to be careful and not\u00a0\u201ctoo extreme\u201d since that could potentially \u201calienate\u201d a huge part of their audience. \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money comes from,\u201d he explains.",
      "But Waid\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t just to make sure the comic\u2019s core readers were satisfied, it was also to authentically portray the Black experience. To do this, the comic book writer says he spoke to his real-life Black friends who made him see a different perspective of America, which included sentiments of \u201cracial hatred\u201d and \u201cbigotry.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018There is more of this going on than you realize \u2026 so just be mindful of that as you go into the story,\u2019\u201d he recalls them saying.",
      "Within Marvel, Waid says his story of Falcon taking on the mantle of Captain America \u201cwas very well received.\u201d But externally, he says there was \u201ca little bit of pushback\u201d from fandom and readers, with some saying, \u2018\u2018Well, this is not Captain America. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d",
      "Looking back, Waid says the pushback by fans wasn\u2019t so severe that he recalls \u201creceiving any hate mail\u201d about it. But he suspects that if he had done this story today, \u201cpeople would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Waid notes that over the last 10 to 15 years, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot more trolling, a lot more blow back. A lot of organized fandom full of angry white guys who are not happy that they are being quote, unquote, eclipsed by people of color, which is bulls--t.\u201d",
      "If we had done this story today, people would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Mark Waid, writer of \u00a0\u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty\u201d",
      "The tenured comic book writer says it comes as no surprise that some fans are upset and even threatening to boycott Marvel\u2019s TV shows and the movies, because \u201cthese are the same people who were up in arms about the comics.\u201d",
      "\u201cLuckily, they have been a small enough part of the audience where we didn\u2019t have to take them into account,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we lost tons of sales because these trolls were out there being actively, performatively angry about the replacement of Captain America by a Black man in a comic book. They weren\u2019t buying the comics anyway. They were just looking for something to be mad about.\u201d",
      "Waid\u2019s introduction of Sam Wilson (Falcon) as Captain America in the comic \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty #9\u201d unfolds in a time of \u201cgreat racial divide\u201d in America.",
      "Steve Rogers (Captain America) is trying to disassociate himself from white supremacists (Sons of Serpents) who are co-opting his name and image because they believe that Cap represents their cause, Waid explains.",
      "\u201c\u2018He\u2019s a blonde white guy with a strong jaw. He\u2019s showing you that this is what America should be,\u2019\u201d he says of their sentiments toward Rogers \u2014 who, during his fight to stop them, appears to get killed. It\u2019s at this juncture that \u201cSam Wilson realizes that someone has to pick up the mantle, someone has to pick up the shield, and someone has to fight to clear the name of Captain America.\u201d",
      "While the film is not exactly like the comics, there are similarities. The film follows Falcon\u2019s fight to uncover a villainous plot against President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) while also helping to exonerate Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) \u2014 a war vet who is turned into a Super Soldier after undergoing human testings by the government \u2014 who was accused of being involved. Some fans have argued that Bradley is the first Black Captain America since he took the Super Solider serum like Cap. Mackie says Sam's sense of integrity and dedication to justice is what he leans into and tries to embody with his titular role.",
      "\u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us,\u201d Mackie tells TODAY.com. \u201cSam didn\u2019t take the (Super Soldier) serum. Sam isn\u2019t a Super Soldier. He\u2019s just a good human being, and I think that\u2019s why we all kind of are endeared to him and kind of appreciate him, because we can see the best of us in him.\u201d",
      "One thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us.\"",
      "Anthony Mackie",
      "Since its first publication in March 1941, Waid says Captain America has had a simple, altruistic purpose: he represented the American dream and showed that it was attainable. But he says Cap\u2019s mission has \u201cchanged\u201d over the years.",
      "\u201cAmerica was the land of opportunity,\u201d Waid tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd clearly it has not always been that way for some people \u2026 And I think that Captain America today stands for equality. He stands for making sure that anyone in this country has an opportunity at bettering themselves and has an opportunity to have the best life possible \u2014 if they\u2019re willing to put the work into it.\u201d",
      "And Anthony Mackie has put that work in with his over two decades in Hollywood and 10 years playing Sam Wilson. Still, even with his tenure, there will still be those who take issue with there being a Black Captain America.",
      "Mackie even gave a nod to the pressure of taking on Cap\u2019s mantle in the film. In an exchange with President Ross following the attack on his life, Mackie\u2019s Sam tells the president that he overwhelmingly understands what he\u2019s going through.",
      "\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to feel you have something to prove,\u201d he says.",
      "Later in the film, Mackie is seen grappling with his past decision to reject the Super Soldier serum and also the pressure that he\u2019s under if he fails his mission.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m not on point, I let everyone who wants a seat at that table down,\u201d he says to his First Lieutenant Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), who takes on Sam's former mantle of Falcon. \u201cThat\u2019s pressure. It makes you feel that you\u2019re not enough.\u201d",
      "The \"Captain America\" comic book writer says there\u2019s always been room\u00a0for the character to change, evolve and represent something more inclusive.",
      "\u201cCaptain America can be an Asian man. Captain America can be a woman. Captain America could be anyone who stands for the ideals that Captain America stands for,\u201d Waid explains, noting that he hopes Cap\u2019s fight eventually \u201cgets easier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs long as they\u2019re an American at heart and fight for the American way \u2026 the way we wish truly was the dream as opposed to what racism and bigotry has sort of poisoned that well.\u201d",
      "Mackie agrees, noting that his Captain America leads with two important things: \u201cCompassion and empathy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like today, we could all use a little compassion and empathy,\u201d he adds."

      "Barbaro, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Baez in the film, tells TODAY.com that while she had texted with the singer before the release of the film, it was a voicemail from Baez, 84, that ended up making her emotional.",
      "\u201cWhen she saw it, she left me the most wonderful voicemail that I got on Golden Globes weekend, and fully just brought me to tears,\u201d Barbaro says. \u201cLike always, to hear her voice \u2014 had that effect on me. And then, and she said wonderful things about my performance, and about Timmy, and about Ed and the movie, and that was wonderful.\u201d",
      "Directed by James (Jim) Mangold, Barbaro stars alongside Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Bob Dylan, Edward Norton as Pete Seeger and Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, in the critically-acclaimed biopic that centers on Dylan\u2019s early beginnings as an artist.",
      "\u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d scooped up eight Academy Award nominations, including best picture, since its release on Dec. 25. Barbaro says prior to Baez seeing the movie, she sent her a text that not only helped her prepare for the \u201ceventuality\u201d of the film\u2019s success, but also her first real encounter with the singer.",
      "\u201cShe was just really cool about it, like I could tell she wasn\u2019t going to tell me that she liked it, just to be nice or anything, you know \u2014she\u2019s not that kind of person,\u201d Barbaro says of their correspondence.",
      "On Feb. 8 \u2014 over a month after the film premiered in theaters \u2014 the pair got to meet in person for the first time at Baez\u2019s performance at a benefit concert in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cIt was just great to hug her and see her. I thought it would be overwhelming, but it felt kind of, familial, like it was really nice,\u201d Barbaro says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll see her again.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was really present and lovely with me, and was like, \u2018When are you landing? What are you (doing) when is all of this over?\u2019\u201d Barbaro continues. \u201cI think she understands probably better than anyone, how much of a whirlwind moments like this can be.\u201d",
      "The 34-year-old actor adds it was \u201camazing\u201d to get to see Baez perform live, after learning how to play guitar and sing the performer\u2019s songs in the film.",
      "\u201cI obviously am very well acquainted with how talented she is, but I just didn\u2019t expect for her voice to be still, so smooth and powerful as it is in her 80s,\u201d Barbaro says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, absolutely incredible. And her stage presence \u2014 she\u2019s so funny, and she just made the crowd, I think, feel really seen.\u201d",

      "\u201cI loved what she did in the film,\u201d Baez told the Journal about Barbaro\u2019s performance. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t think she was good at it, I probably wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it in general. But she looked enough like me and she had my gestures down. You could tell who it was. She worked so hard. Kudos to her for taking the role on.\u201d",
      "Barbaro tells TODAY.com she appreciated Baez publicly speaking out about her performance, because she hasn\u2019t wanted to share what the singer has told her privately.",
      "\u201cI feel very protective of the things she says to me in private, and so it was just really generous of her to then have opened up to the press and said that because nobody has to do that,\u201d Barbaro says.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen a lot of biopics and a lot of characters portrayed, and a lot of responses that are not so positive, or even with a good performance, sometimes people can feel really attached to how a story maybe got something wrong, and she just had a really wonderful way of giving this film over to us.\u201d",
      "In Baez\u2019s interview with the Journal, she also praised Chalamet\u2019s performance as Dylan in the movie (though she did say she remembered the real-life Dylan as a lot scruffier than Chalamet).",
      "\u201cI have to come back to that\u2019s how it was,\u201d Baez said. \u201cWhen he walked into the room, he took up all the oxygen. And so my part was always diminished in his presence. And in that sense the film is accurate.\u201d",
      "Those seemingly authentic moments between Barbaro\u2019s Baez and Chalamet\u2019s Dylan in the film came somewhat naturally to the actors. Barbaro says she didn\u2019t have many conversations with Chalamet prior to their scenes together as the two chose to trust in each other\u2019s abilities.",
      "\u201cTimmy and I didn\u2019t plan anything, and we didn\u2019t really talk much before we came in and did our scenes,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a testament to how much we trusted Jim as a director, and then also trust each other \u2014 trusted each other\u2019s versions of these people.\u201d",
      "She recalls the first scene they shot together, a concert scene in Pittsburgh where Dylan leaves Baez alone on stage.",
      "\u201cHe was improvising as Bob,\u201d Barbaro says of Chalamet. \u201cAnd he just was so clearly locked into Bob\u2019s language and energy. And I just trusted it completely. And I think he trusted me as Joan and we just sort of like, let that dynamic fly.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we just deeply understood these people as best as we could, and then we therefore came up with something authentic,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd the way Jim chose to film it and edit it, I think was indicative of his understanding of their overall dynamic.\u201d",

    "title": "EXCLUSIVE: \u2018Love Is Blind\u2019 star Alex Brown was ready to propose. Why he didn't",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 14:51:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Alex Brown talks about his breakup with Madison Errichiello on Season 8 of Love Is Blind, what happened with Mason and why they split.",
    "story": [
      "Alex Brown is planning to tune in to Season 8 of \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d but he\u2019s admittedly nervous to watch the action unfold on the small screen after living it firsthand last year.",
      "\u201cI might be in bed just crying alone when I watch it. I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d the commercial real estate broker said while speaking to TODAY.com ahead of the premiere.",
      "It\u2019s understandable why the 29-year-old is cautiously awaiting his TV debut. After all, it\u2019s not every day that you watch yourself navigate a love triangle. But that\u2019s exactly what Brown encountered when he entered the \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d dating pods.",
      "Madison Errichiello, one of 32 Minneapolis singles on the latest season of \u201cLove Is Blind, was torn between Brown and another contestant, Mason Horacek.",
      "While drawn to Errichiello, Brown was also wary of an engagement given their experiences with conflict. Errichiello admitted that she had an avoidant attachment style and often \u201cdissociates\u201d when faced with a challenge. Brown, who said he was more anxiously attached, acknowledged Errichiello\u2019s approach was a \u201ctrigger\u201d for him since it reminded him of past relationships and \u201ccould lead to some issues.\u201d",
      "The two finally split up over Errichiello\u2019s reaction to what happened between her and Horacek. After first committing to her, he decided to pursue a connection with another woman, Meg Fink (who turned him down). Despite wanting to be with Brown, Errichiello was offended that Horacek was so quick to backtrack from his initial sentiment. Then, when she told Brown how she was feeling, he said he understood \u201cboth perspectives,\u201d which seemed to escalate Errichiello\u2019s annoyance.",
      "After she seemed to retreat emotionally, the topic of avoidance came up again and Brown expressed his concern that they had two very different communication styles. Ultimately, he decided to walk away from the relationship.",
      "Thanks to love triangles like Brown\u2019s, this season spent a particularly long time in the pod stage \u2014 six full episodes. At this point in the season, five couples are together. Two, like Brown and Errichiello, split in the pods.",
      "Below, Brown analyzes his drawn-out breakup with Errichiello, their love triangle and more.",
      "I went into that final date truly 50/50, not knowing if I was going to propose or end things. It was a really big moment when all that went down. At that point, I still had hope that I was going to propose in the next couple hours. It really shook both of us, I think, when we had that disagreement. It was definitely a tough moment for me.",
      "I think (Madison) and I were clearly on different pages in a couple different ways. I haven\u2019t seen the episodes yet, but what had been discussed several times is attachment styles.",
      "I think her and I are different attachment styles. I think it just is very apparent as the show goes on and as we progressed in the dates.",
      "I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy.",
      "There just wasn\u2019t enough time at that point to figure out if that communication gap was going to be an issue or if we could overcome it or not. And I think it was just too much in the moment for us to move forward.",
      "I guess I try to stay along the same principles of finding someone that matches my attachment style or is as secure as possible. I\u2019ve worked so hard in so many years to build myself up to a point where I feel like I\u2019m in a secure attachment style. I know the effort that that took and I want to find someone that has also put in the effort.",
      "I think I just look for those signs that they\u2019re not gonna fight me or run away or all the things that I used to do and that people that I\u2019ve been with have done in the past. I just want to be in a healthy relationship as much as possible.",
      "I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen.",
      "I\u2019m always going to have empathy for others no matter what the situation is, so I\u2019m definitely glad that I stuck to my guns and had empathy. Maybe that wasn\u2019t the right move in the situation. Maybe it was. But I think from my perspective, it was the right move.",
      "I just honestly, sincerely felt bad for Mason because I saw him 10 minutes before that crying into my arms. Basically, he\u2019s sitting there heartbroken. And then it\u2019s hard to walk into the date (with Madison) and have someone just really talk negatively about him.",
      "So that it was hard for me and I just wanted to give him some of the benefit of the doubt while also trying to understand her perspective as well. Maybe I didn\u2019t do a good job. Maybe I did. I haven\u2019t seen the show yet, so I don\u2019t really remember. It\u2019s been a year now.",
      "I think my ideal partner would be someone who is very open-minded, someone who is adventurous, someone who\u2019s very kind and will stay by my side and be kind and be there for me and have some fun adventures together.",
      "I feel like I really understand how to get deeper with someone and to kind of forget about the appearances and the more surface level things. It allows me to get deeper with people and not really focus on those things anymore. So that\u2019s been a really big impact on my life. From friends to family, I\u2019ve been able to get a lot closer to people and feel more vulnerable."

      "As a California native and Los Angeles resident, \u201cThe Californians\u201d\u00a0sketches\u00a0are spot-on and hilarious. The way that the characters describe having to navigate the freeways, streets and traffic is something every person living in LA understands.

The skits perfectly utilized Tracy Morgan's comedic skills of being able to be na\u00efve and sassy at the same time. I love how Brian Fellow always has beef with the animals because \u201cthat\u2019s crazy!\u201d",

In this version, Robert De Niro gets hilariously annoyed at the \"rude\" interruptions; Robin Williams hardly says a word but says so much. Equally fun is the recurring cast, like Jason Sudeikis in a track suit. Watch out for that snare drum!",

Plus, it was a clear precursor to The Lonely Island\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m on a Boat\u201d with T-Pain, and what else can really be said about that song\u2019s impact on America at the time?",

It was 2015, and I came home from a night of babysitting to my parents absolutely losing it, for an at first undecipherable reason. My dad picks up the remote and rewinds the TV (again), and my mom explains that they\u2019re going to watch an \u201cSNL\u201d sketch for the\u00a0third\u00a0time in a row, just for me to see it, too. By the time Kate McKinnon said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I was dealing with the top brass,\u201d we had to pause to TV to make sure we didn\u2019t miss a line through all the cackling. And as Gosling was laughing out loud behind his hand \u2014\u00a0almost\u00a0missing his queue before getting an assist from Cecily Strong\u2014 tears were streaming down my face.

      "I've loved so many \"SNL\" sketches that choosing just one is like picking between my children. But it's my children that actually inspire my pick. Like sullen \"teens\" David Spade and Christina Applegate, my kids can relate to getting a total dress down on the couch and I can only wish that I'd had Chris Farley, aka motivational speaker, Matt Foley, to fill them with fear over eating a \"steady diet of government cheese\" and living in a van down by the river. Written by Bob Odenkirk, this genius sketch that singularly sums up \"SNL's\" comedy magic to a tee. An unhinged Farley, spitting, spouting, re-adjusting his too-tight belt and ad libbing his lines, Spade breaking character and hiding his laughter beneath his hand, all topped off by a completely unscripted set failure when Farley falls and breaks the coffee table \u2014 yet manages to finish the sketch without missing a beat. Whoops-a-daisy! If there's ever been a reason to steer clear of \"rollin' doobies,\" Matt Foley, is it. Thank you, \"SNL,\" thank you.",

It became a recurring sketch that hilariously tackled the headlines of the day, but this first appearance of Carvey\u2019s condescending Church Lady in particular signaled the dawn of a new era for \u201cSNL,\u201d with her famous lines \u201cSatan!\u201d and \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that special!\u201d entering the pop culture lexicon. Nearly four decades later, Carvey still plays the character when he stops by the show.",

      "You can choose many Phil Hartman sketches, but this one from Season 17 in 1991 is so ridiculous it merits citing. He plays a caveman who fell in ice, only to be thawed out centuries later and become a lawyer, simultaneously overwhelmed and taken in by the conveniences of the modern world. It\u2019s the type of ludicrousness that makes \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d what it is. \u201cYour world frightens and confuses me\u201d became one of the many lines that the late Hartman, who also aced impressions of Ed McMahon, Phil Donahue and Bill Clinton during his \u201cSNL\u201d tenure, perfectly delivered and highlights just how versatile and brilliant a performer he was.",
      "\u2014 D.W.",
      "\u201cSNL\u201d turned comedy into a kind of rock and roll, so it was only fitting that lovable, burned out rock fans Wayne and Garth welcomed Aerosmith to their little cable access show in what may be the quintessential \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d sketch, from Season 15 in 1990. \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d was a smash sketch that later became a hit movie. Getting Aerosmith to play along here (the bit where the band debates the future of communism is fantastic) made sense in much the same way it made people laugh. This sketch also gets bonus points for frequent host Tom Hanks playing a dedicated roadie.",
      "\u2014 D.W.",
      "This piece from Season 16 in 1990 was an instant classic. Patrick Swayze parlayed the moves he showed off a few years earlier in \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d by going toe-to-toe with Chris Farley as two men competing for one spot to be a Chippendales dancer. Swayze has the seductive moves and Farley is a slovenly mess, but we\u2019re to believe it\u2019s a dead heat as they perform. Swayze was the sex symbol, but it\u2019s Farley we can\u2019t stop watching. The sketch takes itself very seriously, which is what makes it even funnier \u2014 that and the fact that it\u2019s Farley at his physically comedic best.",

      "The \"Christimas Party\u201d skit featuring her character Sue was a running joke among my group of friends growing up, especially when it comes to the cheese ball!

This is Macdonald at his all-time wackiest, changing his name to \u201cTurd Fergeson\u201d and making Will Ferrell as Trebek call him the name for the entire episode, which catches on for future sketches. Hammond as Connery is also a staple of the series and a perfectly appropriate over-the-top impression of the actor. He insults Trebek the entire episode, writing, \u201cSuck it, Trebek!\u201d for his final Jeopardy answer. Ferrell\u2019s reactions and demeanor as Trebek when talking to the clueless celebrities are perfect.",

In the sketch, Boseman reprises his \"Black Panther\" role of King T\u2019Challa and, like the other contestants, responds to statements as it relates to their Black culture. One of the now viral clues in the \u201cBlack Jeopardy!\u201d category of \u201cWhite People,\u201d centered around a \u201cKaren\u201d bringing her potato salad to a Black person\u2019s cookout. Bosemen\u2019s humorous and culturally relatable response as T\u2019Challa immediately became a meme.

He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "Daniel and Taylor",
      "Daniel Hastings and Taylor Haag matched each other\u2019s energy from their first conversation. He joked about proposing a few minutes into their chat and she playfully went along. When she returned to gush with the girls, Taylor, a 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse, said she appreciated that Daniel, a 30-year-old sales account executive, repeatedly spoke about searching for the mother of his kids.",

Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",

Joey, a 35-year-old physician associate, and Monica, a 28-year-old digital marketer, seemed to only form a bond with each other. They quickly connected thanks to their bubbly and quirky personalities and their love for \u201cThe Sound of Music.\u201d Joey also supported Monica when she revealed that she was between jobs because she needed to take time off to help her family.",
      "By Episode 2, they already knew that they wanted to get engaged and leave the pods together, making them the first official couple of Season 8.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible time falling in love with who you are as a person, your laugh, your voice, and I would love to take the next step with you,\u201d Joey said.",

    "story": [
      "(Warning: Spoilers from Season 2, Episode 12 of \u201cFound.\u201d)",
      "In the latest episode of \u201cFound,\u201d fans finally receive an answer to one of the biggest questions that has stumped them since the show premiered: How did Gabi and Sir\u2019s twisted partnership begin?",
      "Season 2, Episode 12, out Feb. 13, flashes back to the moment Gabi, played by Shanola Hampton, and Sir, portrayed by Mark-Paul Gosselaar, came face to face about 20 years after he kidnapped her. Viewers see Gabi intend to kill Sir, hoping to end her years of suffering and fear, before he changes her mind. He pitches that the two collaborate on her M&A cases, allowing their toxic, unbreakable bond to continue.",
      "A majority of the episode, titled \"Missing While Misidentified,\" is set in the past while in the present, both Gabi and Sir are arrested and questioned separately by the police.",
      "\u201cThis is my favorite episode that I\u2019ve ever shot on the show,\u201d Hampton tells TODAY.com in an interview.",
      "She adds, \u201cTo see that rage and that passion of why she did what she did, it was just so fun to do and I was so excited to play it.\u201d",
      "Gosselaar says the episode also digs deeper into the psychology behind Sir\u2019s attachment to Gabi.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a question that people have asked about the first season. Like, \u2018Was he able to escape? How did he escape? Did he want to escape?\u2019 So I think we get a glimpse of that in Episode 212,\u201d he shares.",
      "Below, the two stars unpack all the secrets that were revealed in Season 2, Episode 12 in a joint interview with TODAY.com \u2014 and why Sir and Gabi's relationship is a dynamic \"we have not seen play out on television before.\"",
      "Gosselaar: It\u2019s been lovely. This has been just a great season. The fact that I don\u2019t have to be in the same room as you for so many hours.",
      "Hampton: That\u2019s what I was going to say, too. You know how you go on \"Love Is Blind\" and you want to switch your answer to \"no\" after they say \"No\" (at the altar)?",
      "Gosselaar: Honestly, I do enjoy the scenes that Sir has with Gabrielle in Episode 212 \u2014 we go back to the origin. It\u2019s fun to watch the dynamic between the two characters. And there\u2019s just so much going on, right? So it\u2019s fun to shoot and it\u2019s fun to watch.",
      "Hampton: I make no secret that I get to work with wonderful actors on this show. But my scenes with Mark-Paul, they lift me. And when he\u2019s there and he\u2019s present, on a personal level, it lifts me. So, not having as much interaction this season was really a bit of a shock to my system, because I got so used to it Season 1. I relied on those days as an escape day for me, and so not having that was quite an adjustment. Truthfully, that\u2019s how I feel about it. And hopefully in Season 3 we will be back on the screen together a lot!",
      "Gosselaar: How did it happen? I think that\u2019s a big question of the first season. How did she abduct Sir? Why is he in her basement? Somebody had to help. Who helped her? All those questions get answered. And for us, as fans of our show, that was fun to read and fun to do. We always end on a cliffhanger. That\u2019s by design. The next script for us, we just can\u2019t wait to get into it. So we\u2019re sort of mirroring what the audience is going through, just in a different way.",
      "Hampton: This is my favorite episode that I\u2019ve ever shot on the show. To be able to answer some of the questions from Season 1 in this episode, to see the mindset, to play the dynamics and the nuances of dealing with Margaret (Kelli Williams) while making this choice, and to see Dhan\u2019s (Karan Oberoi) part in it. All of these things where it just was so juicy to me. To see that rage and that passion of why she did what she did, it was just so fun to do and I was so excited to play it. I like seeing Gabi here, because I think the audience gets to really go on the ride that she went through in a real way.",
      "Hampton: I think it\u2019s telling to the psychological damage that one does to the victim and how hard it is to break the cycle. Our central theme is not to judge people\u2019s healing process. People are so quick to say, \"Just block them, girl! Don\u2019t talk to him anymore!\" Everybody has advice until they\u2019re there. Now, she can search why and really heal so that when she does press block, if that time ever comes, it\u2019s out of a place of healing. That was really a telling moment, I think, for Gabi, for me as the actor playing Gabi, and for the audience to see, \"Oh, this goes way deeper than we even think.\"",
      "Gosselaar: I just think it reinforced that a lot of the time that Sir is there by choice. That\u2019s a question that people have asked about the first season. Like, \"Was he able to escape? How did he escape? Did he want to escape?\" So I think we get a glimpse of that in Episode 212.",
      "Hampton: Sick. It\u2019s an obsession of sorts. There\u2019s no real definition. We\u2019ve not really seen this dynamic play out on television before. So to have it not be a sexual chemistry or him wanting to marry her, wifey her up \u2014 you just see him wanting a life with her. So it\u2019s weird.",
      "Gosselaar: There\u2019s so many things. We don\u2019t choose family, so I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s why he uses that word. That even years can go by and because you have the bond of family, it\u2019s an unbreakable bond. So I think he\u2019s very particular in the words that he chooses. But \"family\" is deep and it\u2019s really dark. I guess that\u2019s what people come to our show for.",
      "Hampton: Well, it shows that it\u2019s going to be a disconnect. This means a lot less time of them being in the same room. Gabi (is) putting a line in the sand, saying, \"I\u2019m not giving into his manipulation.\" It sets up the next several episodes of what the dynamic is going to be with Sir and Gabi.",
      "Gosselaar: We\u2019re just going to see moments where the lack of control is going to eat at him. You\u2019re just going to see him do everything in his power to connect.",
      "Gosselaar: We have a great group of actors, very talented. There\u2019s a few stinkers. Actually, just one. But I won\u2019t name names, because that wouldn\u2019t be fair to the other actors. We are a very ambitious show. We\u2019ve said this before: we have 44 minutes to tell a story, and this story is just packed with plot and characters. It was very difficult to get this all on screen. We did, and we have just an unbelievable crew that works their butt off every single day of our show for the nine months that we\u2019re filming. So my hat goes off to them. We have great writers and everyone working behind us and all the actors. It is truly a collaboration that couldn\u2019t be done with one of the parts missing. Thankfully we don\u2019t have any parts missing, and it just makes for a great show. I hope we can continue with Season 3. Maybe I\u2019ll just have to have a conversation with that actor that was slowing things down.",
      "Hampton: That actor says that she has in her contract not to speak to her or look her in the eyes, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. (laughs)",
      "Hampton: It\u2019s awful. So what people don\u2019t understand is that Mark-Paul is the lead on this show, but he doesn\u2019t work. So it\u2019s one day a week, which means I only have to stomach him one day. When he\u2019s directing, he\u2019s gotta prep. His presence is there. He has to direct all eight days. You know what eight days is like being with Mark-Paul? No, it was amazing.",
      "Gosselaar: Actually, I was there for a lot longer. We went through a hurricane together. I was there for three weekends. I was like, \"What is going on here? I\u2019ve never worked so hard in my life!\"",
      "Hampton: What I\u2019ll say about Mark-Paul as a director, and this is for future projects as well, what you\u2019re going to get is someone who is intellectually prepared, technically prepared, but also able to be really chill when things need to change. He has so much experience on set. He is a leader of not only the cast but the crew. He commands trust on day one, and he\u2019s a joy. I mean, he is a stick in the mud. And yes, you would think he\u2019s boring and a jerk. But he\u2019s actually super funny, and people enjoy being around him. I\u2019m not one of those people. He is one of the five directors that I would work with for the rest of my career and be happy.",
      "Hampton: I think it\u2019s that they thought they were just going to get another procedural, and then there was a man in the basement. You start the ride and you cannot get off, because you have to see what\u2019s going to happen with these two characters while serving the communities who are underserved. So I think that\u2019s where the connection has happened.",
      "Gosselaar: I agree. I like how you started that off. Because it\u2019s like the audience thought they were just going to get Shanola, and then they got Mark-Paul Gosselaar.",
      "Hampton: (laughs) Not what I said, Sir!",
      "Gosselaar: Pretty much. You said the procedural and then you were, like, \"Then the guy in the basement.\" I totally agree with that.",
      "Hampton: I mean, how many Critics Choice nominations did you get before working with me? You\u2019re welcome.",
      "Gosselaar: Same as you. (laughs)",

Among the cast, which TODAY exclusively announced in June, were \u201cBig Brother\u201d legends Danielle Reyes and Britney Haynes, deceptive \u201cSurvivor\u201d winners Tony Vlachos and Jeremy Collins and reality television favorites Chrishell Stause and Gabby Windey.",

      "Dorinda Medley made a costly mistake in Episode 1 when she decided to sacrifice her safety in the mission to help the team complete the task. After her selfless act was unappreciated by the rest of the cast, The \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star bickered with British royal Lord Ivar Mountbatten and a few others, placing a target on her back. The Traitors pounced on the opportunity and decided to make her their first victim, killing her off in Episode 2.",

      "During Episode 2, at the first roundtable of Season 3, Wells Adams had the tables turned on him. He initially planned to call out \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Robyn Dixon as a potential Traitor following an awkward interaction between them earlier. But, she proved to be more convincing and reflected the spotlight onto him instead. \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d alum was banished after receiving a majority of the votes. Before he left, he revealed that he was a Faithful.",

      "Chanel Ayan seemed, admittedly, unprepared for the duplicity she would face on \u201cThe Traitors.\u201d Like Dorinda, she erroneously chose to get off the boat in Episode 1. Then, she struggled after Wells\u2019 elimination as he was one of her closest friends and allies in the house. In Episode 3, the Traitors decided to murder another housewife to create more confusion in the castle. As \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star learned her fate, she became emotional and questioned how the Traitors could be so cruel.",
      "Tony Vlachos",
      "Tony Vlachos, a two-time \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner, had his stint on Season 3 cut short after placing his trust in the wrong people. During the third mission, Bob Harper called out Tony for not volunteering to go first and risk his safety. Tony didn\u2019t appreciate being put on blast and voiced his irritations during the car ride home. At the roundtable, Bob Harper learned Tony was upset with him and started to wonder if Tony was a Traitor. Although the \u201cSurvivor\u201d star tried to prove his innocence, a majority of the cast voted him out in Episode 3. Before departing, a hurt Tony confirmed he was a Faithful and labeled fellow \u201cSurvivor\u201d alum Rob Mariano a \u201csellout\u201d for turning on him.",
      "Jeremy Collins",
      "Episode 4 began with the conclusion of a special task for the Traitors. They were required to meet in a secret room in the castle and scribe three names, either Faithfuls or Traitors, onto a hidden parchment, shortlisting them for murder. The Traitors selected \"Survivor\" winner Jeremy Collins, \"Summer House\" star Ciara Miller and retired professional wrestler Nikki Garcia. Each person then had to lie down in a coffin and await their fate. Although Jeremy offered to work with the Traitors if he was spared, they chose to murder him since he correctly suspected \"Big Brother\" star Danielle Reyes was a Traitor. In his final confessional, Jeremy became emotional as he spoke about not bringing home the prize pot to his family.",
      "Bob the Drag Queen",
      "Bob the Drag Queen's devilishly cunning run on Season 3 was cut short in Episode 4 when his fellow Traitors, particularly Rob, turned on him. Bob had been vocal throughout the season, trying to cast suspicion onto others and throw his adversaries off his scent. But when he suggested the group question if the three newcomers \u2014 Rob, Wes and Derrick \u2014 were possible Traitors, Rob took it as an opportunity stab the \"RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\" winner in the back. Rob convinced the group to banish Bob, stunning him. After being voted out, Rob stood before the cast and proudly confirmed he had lied and was a Traitor.",
      "Robyn Dixon",
      "After a roaring roundtable that resulted in one of their own being exposed, the remaining Traitors plotted in Episode 5 to murder someone who would draw suspicion away from them. They debated back and forth, with one Traitor failing to be heard. Ultimately, they decided that murdering Robyn Dixon would add to the confusion permeating throughout the castle. When \"The Real Housewives of Potomac\" star learned she had been eliminated, she said, \"I knew it was coming because I am a threat to the Traitors.\" In her parting words, she advised the Traitors to \"work harder\" after losing Bob the Drag Queen.",
      "Nikki Garcia",
      "Nikki Garcia was living on borrowed time in the castle after the Traitors set up her inevitable downfall. After being selected as one of the three contestants to lie in the coffin in Episode 4, the rest of the contestants assumed that at least one cast member chosen was a Traitor. The former WWE star deflected suspicion at first, but in Episode 5, one of her closest allies, Chrishell Stause, started to doubt her. Chrishell voiced her concerns about Nikki during the roundtable, leading most of the group to vote her out. \"The win for me is that I do get to go home to my son. The loss for all of you is that I'm a Faithful,\" Nikki said as she left.",
      "Bob Harper",
      "As Episode 6 began, the trust between the Traitors was at an all time low.  They met in the turret and discussed their \"dysfunctional family\" before listing their targets. They settled on Bob Harper, who was vocal at the most recent roundtable about who the Faithfuls couldn't trust. The three remaining Traitors labeled him as \"the more imminent threat\" and agreed to murder him. When \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer didn't show up for breakfast the next morning, the cast, excluding the Traitors, were stunned. After Bob H. read his letter from the Traitors, he said, \"No f---ing way. I think the Traitors are playing a really ballsy game. They're very invincible right now because they are so hidden. I'm angry. I'm just angry over the train of thought of why I was murdered. I hate the Traitors.\"",
      "Wes Bergmann",
      "At the end of the Episode 6, Wes Bergmann planned to turn on Rob, but the \"Survivor\" winner beat him to it. Throughout the episode, Wes had been suggesting Rob's name to multiple people. When everyone arrived at the roundtable, Rob used Wes' scheming ways against him and pointed out that Wes pushed for Nikki to be banished. To defend himself, Wes warned that he would target anyone who voted against him. His tactic didn't work and pushed the Faithfuls in the opposite direction, making them vote to banish him. \"The Challenge\" star delivered one of his signature boastful speeches before he left, calling himself \"one of the greatest reality competition players of all time.\" He added, \"I don't care about any of you. You are all chess pieces on a board. And so to all those people that have died until I got to this circle right here, I have no idea who killed them because I'm a Faithful.\"",
      "Derrick Levasseur",
      "Derrick Levasseur took a chance during the roundtable in Episode 6 and voiced his theory about Rob being a traitor. The next episode, his boldness came back to bite him. When the Traitors met in secret at the beginning of Episode 7, they begrudgingly decided the \"Big Brother\" winner needed to go to help rebuild trust between them. As Derrick learned his fate, he was unsurprised. \"I knew that after I called out Rob directly last night, and he chose to instead go at Wes, that he was not going to give me another roundtable, which I guess I have to take as a compliment,\" Derrick said. He proudly added, \"I'm the most dangerous person in here for the Traitors, and they know it.\" He said he would have made the same move and that he was \"honored\" to have been a part of the season.",
      "Rob 'Boston Rob' Mariano",
      "Rob's smooth-talking and cunning ways could no longer save him by Episode 7. Before he departed, Derrick planted seeds to his fellow Faithfuls, cautioning them that Rob was a Traitor. At breakfast, Rob posed the theory that the Traitors had murdered Derrick to make the \"Survivor\" star look guilty. But \"Vanderpump Rules\" star Tom Sandoval was unconvinced and realized that it was the third time a Faithful was murdered after publicly going against Rob. So, Tom presented that evidence during the roundtable, hoping that others would jump on board. After everyone voted, Rob received a majority of votes \u2014 including two from his fellow Traitors \u2014 and was banished, ending his masterful run this season. \"First of all, I just want to tell all of you that I have really enjoyed meeting you and playing this game with you. I've had a ton of fun,\" he said during his final speech. \"I am, and always have been, from the very beginning, a Traitor.\"",
      "Chrishell Stause",
      "At the start of Episode 8, Chrishell Stause was one of the few remaining players that did not secure a shield in the previous mission. So, she had to dress to the nines and go to the chapel to learn if the Traitors decided to murder her. While the other vulnerable players turned around and saw Cumming waiting for them near the pews, Chrishell came face to face with the two remaining Traitors. The \"Selling Sunset\" star seemed slightly shocked as she discovered the Traitors' identities. They explained that she would've never been banished, so they needed to eliminate her. \"That's unfortunate,\" Chrishell simply said. In her final confessional interview, she said that all of the Faithfuls had been \"idiots\" and that one particular Traitor was \"playing the best game.\" She added, \"I wasn't ready to leave. But, if I must go, I appreciate the fabulous send off.\"",
      "Ciara Miller",
      "The remaining Faithfuls desperately searched for any evidence that could point them in the direction of a Traitor. Sam Asghari suggested that the group revisit the theory that one of the Traitors was in the coffins in Episode 3. With Jeremy murdered and Nikki banished, that left Ciara as the only possible option. At the round table in Episode 8, Ciara explained that her passionate speech after she was placed in the coffin was an example of her pleading for her life in the game. She also tried to cast doubt on two contestants. But, the other players did not trust her and all voted to banish the \"Summer House\" star. \"I don't really do speeches, but I'll always go down fighting. I'm never succumbing to anyone,\" she said during her final remarks. \"Even the Traitors, because I am a Faithful.\""

      "After three \"Karate Kid\" movies and several TV seasons of \"Cobra Kai,\" Ralph Macchio's Daniel LaRusso is still learning more about his mentor, Mr. Miyagi. And in the series' final episodes, he receives one last lesson from his sensei.",
      "Pat Morita originated the Mr. Miyagi role in the 1984 film \"The Karate Kid.\" He returned for \"The Karate Kid Part II,\" \"The Karate Kid Part III\" and the Hilary Swank-led \"The Next Karate Kid.\"",
      "Daniel's story picked back up in 2018 with the premiere of \"Cobra Kai.\" While Morita died in November 2005, his character has appeared in the Netflix spinoff show through archival footage.",
      "Fans of the show know that Mr. Miyagi has become an almost omnipresent figure, guiding Daniel even in death as Daniel tries to take up the mantle of sensei for the next generation of Los Angeles karate prodigies. He names his dojo Miyago-Do and tries to pass on the teachings of his late mentor, often running up against rival Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka).",
      "But Season Six complicates what Daniel knew about Mr. Miyagi's past. For a quick refresher, in the original \"Karate Kid\" film, Mr. Miyagi tells a young Daniel that he served in World War II and his wife died in childbirth at a U.S. internment camp. \"The Karate Kid Part II\" dives deeper into his past in Okinawa, revealing that Miyagi left Japan for Hawaii after a falling-out with his best friend Sato, the uncle of Chozen (Yuji Okumoto).",
      "Flash forward to Season Six of \"Cobra Kai.\" Throughout the season, Macchio's character learns new information about Mr. Miyagi's background that \u201cunravels\u201d Daniel in the process, Macchio previously told TODAY.com.",
      "Ahead of the Season Six, Part Three, premiere Feb. 13, Macchio said that throughout the creation of \"Cobra Kai\" he asked the writers room to \"find places that we could mine areas of Daniel LaRusso that we don't know.\"",
      "\"The series always did that with Johnny Lawrence, and LaRusso always kind of played a thorn in his side. So I was getting frustrated, saying, 'Let's go deeper here,'\" Macchio said.",
      "While the story takes a dark turn in Part Two, Mr. Miyagi's memory reminds Daniel of the \"most important lesson\" in Part Three, setting the stage for Miyagi-Do to bow out of the fight and Cobra Kai to rise for one last strike.",
      "What is Mr. Miyagi\u2019s secret in \u2018Cobra Kai\u2019 Season 6?",
      "In Season Six, Part One \u2014 which is comprised of the first five episodes of the season \u2014 Daniel unearths a box that belonged to Mr. Miyagi. Inside, he finds boxing gloves, a passport, a piece of fabric and a newspaper clipping with the headline \"Police search for assailant,\" dated to 1947. The passport features a photo of Mr. Miyagi next to the name Keisuke Miyagi, rather than Nariyoshi, the first name Daniel knew him to have. The clipping also reveals that Keisuke Miyagi was accused of violent robbery and assault.",
      "The boxing gloves and passport address lead Daniel to a gym. A man, purporting to be the grandson of the gym's original owner, says Mr. Miyagi was a silent partner in the gym. The man also reveals that Mr. Miyagi at one point fled the United States.",
      "In the last scene of Episode 5, Daniel realizes the significance of the headband. After Miyagi-Do qualifies for an international karate tournament in Barcelona, the Sekai Taikai, Daniel realizes the fabric matches the headbands awarded to team captains. The moment implies that Mr. Miyagi has a history at the Sekai Taikai, sending Daniel on a mission to learn more about his mentor's past \u2014\u00a0and all of its dark twists and turns.",
      "\"He\u2019s kind of chasing the past instead of focusing on the present, let alone the future, for his students and everyone else,\" Macchio told TODAY.com.",
      "Daniel continues to dig into Mr. Miyagi's past in Part Two because his character can't help but investigate, Macchio said.",
      "\"When you have loss in your life, whether it\u2019s a parent or a mentor or a brother or sister, and you have something unknown, you grasp it, wanting to understand,\" Macchio said. \"It\u2019s important to go through that to get to the other side, to the resolve of what that is.",
      "\"In Part Two, it\u2019s the deepest and darkest dive for him that gets him a bit in trouble,\" Macchio added.",
      "Once the Miyagi-Do crew arrives in Barcelona for the Sekai Taikai, Daniel starts asking organizers if they recognize Mr. Miyagi's headband. In Episode 6, a woman representing the company that makes the tournament's official apparel tells Daniel that Miyagi's headband was likely from the \"1950s era, maybe even 1940s,\" meaning Mr. Miyagi was likely involved in the Sekai Taikai after World War II.",
      "The headband is coated in dried blood, and one of the organizers reveals that the Sekai Taikai tournaments \"were even more brutal back then.\"",
      "Daniel's search for more info about Miyagi's background with the tournament hits a snag in Episode 7. Shenanigans ensue, including the return of the No. 3 most villainest \"Karate Kid\" universe villain according to TODAY.com, Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith), who was responsible for kidnapping Daniel. At the end of Episode 9, Silver, now associated with the defending champions, the Iron Dragons dojo, gives Daniel a manila envelope.",
      "\"A gift, from me to you,\" Silver says.",
      "Inside is a piece of paper, purportedly the Sekai Taikai record from the year Mr. Miyagi competed. The spreadsheet shows that Miyagi faced someone named Claramunt. In the final score column, it simply says, \"Death.\"",
      "\"He killed his opponent,\" Daniel says in shock.",
      "Later in Part Two, Daniel goes back to the tournament organizers, and they authenticate the sheet of paper with the record of Mr. Miyagi\u2019s fight.",

      "\u201cWe never want to taint who the essence of that character was,\u201d Macchio said. \u201cBut we\u2019re all human, and everyone has flaws.\u201d",
      "The Part Two finale, Episode 10, opens with Daniel having a nightmare after finding out about Mr. Miyagi's past. In the sequence, he faces a young Mr. Miyagi, as someone from the crowd shouts, \"Kill him, Miyagi-san.\"",
      "The fight starts, and the young Miyagi gets off the first and second points. \"If this is a lesson, I'm not getting it,\" Daniel says.",
      "\"Lesson?\" the dream Miyagi responds in Japanese.",
      "\"There's so much you never told me,\" Daniel says next. \"I just need to understand why.\"",
      "\"That was always your problem, Daniel-san. So eager to understand, but not willing to accept,\" Miyagi says.",
      "Daniel, now lying on his back, looks up at Miyagi before the final hit. He blinks, and a face resembling Morita's looks back at him and says, \"Miyagi never tell you everything, Daniel-san, because you were never strong enough to accept truth.\"",
      "The scene required the use of special effects and artificial intelligence to pull it off, \"Cobra Kai\" co-creators Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg\u00a0told Deadline in November.",
      "\"There\u2019s a combination of practical and digital and artificial technologies that come together to make it happen,\" Heald said. \"There\u2019s a real stand-in performer for that moment. There\u2019s some digital design, like mapping of faces that happens and using artificial intelligence for all that, especially when it comes to voicing.\"",
      "Hurwitz added that the idea of bringing Mr. Miyagi back started with a conversation with Macchio and with Morita's estate.",
      "\"If we were going to do this, we had to do it the right way by getting involved with (Morita\u2019s) estate and making sure they were comfortable with it. We also contacted one of Pat\u2019s daughters with whom we have a relationship,\" Hurwitz said. \"Ralph spoke with her about the scene to ensure everyone was on board and felt good about what we were doing.\"",
      "Mr. Miyagi makes another appearance on screen in Episode 13, albeit with a very different tone.",
      "After Sam (Mary Mouser) questions why she's fighting in the reinvigorated Sekai Taikai \u2014\u00a0knowing Miyagi-Do doesn't stand a chance at winning due to the point deficit \u2014 Daniel dreams of himself asking Mr. Miyagi for guidance. Suddenly, masked figures wearing skeleton costumes, just like the ones worn by Johnny and company on Halloween in \"The Karate Kid\" fight scene that started it all, swarm Daniel's backyard. As he prepares to fight them off, Mr. Miyagi arrives to defend his student, and the duo beat the masked figures together.",
      "After, a tearful Daniel asks Mr. Miyagi why he didn't tell him about his history with the Sekai Taikai.",
      "\"Why did you leave me all alone, without any answers?\" he shouts. \"I've been fighting so hard, Mr. Miyagi, trying to do what you would do. But we can't win.\"",
      "Mr. Miyagi then puts his hand over Daniel's heart.",
      "\"Daniel-san, answer same place as always. Remember, Miyagi teach win, lose \u2014 no matter. No need to fight anymore,\" Mr. Miyagi responds, before Daniel wakes up.",
      "The next morning, when Sam tells her dad that she doesn't want to fight in the tournament, Daniel passes on Mr. Miyagi's lesson. He ultimately decides to let Miyagi-Do's fighters gracefully leave the Sekai Taikai, allowing Johnny to return to Cobra Kai and lead it to victory.",
      "\"When I asked Mr. Miyagi to train me, I thought it was to fight. And then I learned maybe the most important lesson he ever taught me,\" Daniel says. \"I was training so I wouldn't have to fight. You're not giving up. You figured out something that I forget too often: The greatest victory karate can bring to you is not having to fight at all.\"",
      "Macchio told TODAY.com the dream sequence represents a scene with Mr. Miyagi he's long wanted to create.",
      "\"I've always wanted to have that moment where they would be fighting together, even if only in his mind,\" Macchio said.",
      "Overall, Episode 13, titled \"Skeletons,\" is full of nostalgia.",
      "\"I call it the 'Cobra-Cry' episode,\" Macchio said. \"Everybody has their moment.\"",
      "For Daniel, it represents the \"last lesson\" from his mentor, Macchio said.",
      "\"Going forward, he takes that wisdom, but it was all in his own mind that he figured it out,\" Macchio said. \"But we get to visually see Daniel and Mr. Miyagi together again.\"",

      "Often maligned as one of the core villains of the '80s franchise, \"Cobra Kai\" explores what happens to a bully decades after he's beaten. Over the show's six seasons, Johnny, the series' \"hero,\" Daniel LaRusso, and the next generation \u2014 including their children \u2014 have sparred, forged reluctant alliances and even become friends.",
      "But \"Cobra Kai\" is Johnny's story. And the final season, which dropped on Netflix Feb. 13, drives that point home.",
      "The show, which premiered in 2018 on YouTube Red before later moving to Netflix, opened with Johnny on the heels of losing his handyman job, dealing with alcoholism and estranged from his teenage son. By the series finale, he's a proud husband, father and stepdad and a business owner, and he left the All Valley Sports Arena \u2014 the setting of the All Valley Karate Tournament way back in 1984 \u2014 again a champion.",
      "Ralph Macchio \u2014\u00a0who plays Daniel, Johnny's rival turned friend \u2014 has said that the \"Cobra Kai\" finale embraces the \"big '80s movie ending.\"",
      "\"It has that element of all the feels, the tears and the cheers of an '80s film,\" Macchio tells TODAY.com. \"It's sort of going back to the roots of overcoming obstacles, wish fulfillment, aspiration, victory ... all that stuff that you used to go to the theater and get your popcorn and jump out of your chair and high-five the person next to you. It really ends in that way.\"",

      "Macchio says the sacrifice was necessary to revisit Cobra Kai in a \"positive light.\"",
      "\"Earning that was the challenge, in a show that's kind of a karate soap opera, as I call it,\" Macchio says. \"It raised the stakes. You had to hit rock bottom for it to come back and bring it back to all those elements that you want to see, that is the essence of 'The Karate Kid' lore.\"",

      "Throughout the season, the Iron Dragons, a Hong Kong-based dojo led by Sensei Wolf (Lewis Tan) and, for a time, Terry Silver (Thomas Ian Griffith), dominate the Sekai Taikai. Cobra Kai, led by John Kreese (Martin Kove) and fighters Kwon (Brandon Lee) and Tory (Peyton List), are in second. Miyagi-Do just barely makes it to the semifinals, at which Sam (Mary Mouser) and Robby (Tanner Buchanan) are set to compete.",
      "In the middle of Robby\u2019s semifinal match against the Iron Dragons' Axel, an eliminated team attacks the tournament\u2019s organizer, starting a brawl between all of the dojos. Amid the chaos, Kreese tries to go after Silver with a eunjangdo, a small knife, but drops it.",
      "Kwon finds the knife and tries to use it against Axel. But Kwon has his leg swept in midair, and he falls on the blade. Daniel rolls Kwon over, the blade sticking out of his chest.",

      "Reeling from the death of Kwon, Kreese backs out of the fight. Silver and Wolf, however, seek victory by any means possible.",
      "In Episode 14, with Johnny and his team still in contention, Silver concocts a contingency plan to threaten Johnny's new wife, Carmen (Vanessa Rubio), and their infant daughter. But his plans are foiled by Kreese, and the former friends again face off, this time on Silver's yacht.",
      "Silver, fighting with a broken bottle, gets the upper hand and almost chokes Kreese. But the scuffle knocks over a tank of gasoline, and Kreese, always armed with a cigar, throws the smoldering stick into the spill, causing a giant explosion.",

      "After the tournament resumes after Kwon's accidental death, Robby from Miyagi-Do leaves the competition with a serious leg injury at the hands of Axel. Sam chooses not to fight after realizing it's impossible to make up the overall point deficit, leaving Daniel and Miyagi-Do to gracefully bow out of the competition.",
      "So, the only hope to defeat the Iron Dragons becomes Cobra Kai. With Kreese gone, Tory is left without a sensei and without a male counterpoint to fight in the men's final. Enter: the original duo that restarted Cobra Kai, Johnny and Miguel (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a).",
      "In the penultimate episode, Tory and Miguel beat the Iron Dragons' Zara and Axel to become Sekai Taikai individual champions. But in the overall competition, the dojos' cumulative points stand tied. Requiring a slight suspension of disbelief, the rules of the tournament state that a tie can only be broken by a fight between senseis, meaning Johnny has to face Wolf.",
      "To prepare, Johnny asks Daniel to be his sensei, and the former rivals train on a California beach in an elaborate montage set to, of course, \"You\u2019re The Best.\" As the match starts, Daniel dons Cobra Kai's signature black gi.",

    "summary": "Molly Shannon talked to TODAY about what it was like having Whitney Houston appear in one of her Mary Katherine Gallagher sketches on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "One of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d most iconic sketches nearly didn\u2019t have one of music\u2019s most iconic singers take part in it.",
      "During Season 22 in 1996, Whitney Houston appeared in one of the popular Mary Katherine Gallagher sketches on \u201cSNL\u201d when she served as that episode's musical guest, but Molly Shannon, who famously portrayed the nervous Catholic schoolgirl on the classic comedy show, says the late pop star almost missed out.",
      "\u201cI wanted Whitney in the Mary Katherine Gallagher sketch,\u201d Shannon told TODAY on Feb. 13. \u201cIt was a Christmas sketch with Rosie O\u2019Donnell and Penny Marshall, and they said, \u2018You\u2019re never going to get Whitney Houston. She\u2019s not going to be in a Mary Katherine Gallagher sketch.\u2019 \u2018No, I\u2019ll get her. I\u2019ll get her.\u2019",
      "\u201cSo, I went and talked to her. And I said, \u2018Whitney, can you be in it? You play a snotty schoolgirl, and you have to try to out-sing me.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ll do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Landing the \u201cHow Will I Know\u201d singer turned out to be the easy part, though, because Houston was nowhere to be found as the time came to perform the sketch.",
      "\u201cBut then the night of the show, she wasn\u2019t there, and I was panicked,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cSo they had to get Ana Gasteyer dressed up to do Whitney\u2019s part.",
      "\u201cBut then at the last second \u2014 I\u2019m talking five seconds before we went on \u2014 Whitney showed up. \u2018Get Whitney! Swap Ana out!\u2019 And she came on, and she killed it. She nailed it.\u201d",
      "Shannon, who is slated to be among the stars who will appear on the Feb. 16 special celebrating 50 years of \"SNL,\" said everything worked out and Houston was a delight.",
      "\u201cIt was a classic sketch. And then at the end she was surrounded by a crowd of people, and she saw me and she was like, \u2018Molly!\u2019 She was like, \u2018Girl, you\u2019re crazy!\u2019 She was so sweet,\u201d Shannon said.",
      "While Mary Katherine Gallagher proved to be one of Shannon\u2019s most popular and enduring characters from \u201cSNL,\u201d she said the character almost got cut from the show because the response was tepid.",
      "\u201cYou put the sketches in the read-through and I had done the character in my stage show. And it\u2019s very physical,\u201d she said. \u201cI fall through chairs. At the table read, they would just read, \u2018Oh, she falls into chairs. She does gymnastics.\u2019 And I don\u2019t know if they knew exactly how physical (it has to be).\u201d",
      "Shannon said the sketch didn\u2019t appear to be a priority when she introduced it.",
      "\u201cSo, when it was the dress rehearsal, I remember they put it really low on the list, because usually stuff they maybe don\u2019t believe in as much, they\u2019re going to put low on the dress (rehearsal) list. It might get cut,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAnd I was kind of mad. I was like, \u2018I think they\u2019re not getting what this is. So I\u2019m going to\u00a0have to show them in a dress rehearsal.\u2019 And then I did it, and the audience loved it.\u201d",
      "She also said she learned the sketch got the green light by stopping into \u201cSNL\u201d creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels\u2019 office.",
      "\u201cAnd then you go into Lorne\u2019s office in the middle of between dress and air to find out what made it into the show and it\u2019s like seeing if you get cast in a play,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Mary Katherine Gallagher got moved from the bottom of the show to the top. Yes!",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s good that I did create a character that was so nervous, because I, Molly Shannon, got really nervous. So you could just use your nervous energy and pour it into the character.\u201d"

      "\"We have to accept that and we can deal with it. But I am convinced that it is not in the interests of the international community for this worldview to become the dominant paradigm,\u201d said Steinmeier, whose post is largely ceremonial, according to Reuters.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u00a0said the world had reached a \"moment in history\" where \"great challenges loom,\" as she called on the international community to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable for proving \"he has given up\" a bid to \"destroy Ukraine.\"",
      "There is growing alarm across Europe after what Trump described as a \u201clengthy and highly productive\u201d conversation with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Trump was accused of shutting Kyiv and Europe out of peace talks, while comments he made about the future of Ukraine prompted fear and anger in that country and across Europe.",
      "Speaking at the security conference Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had spoken with Trump and warned the American president not to believe Putin when he said he wanted to be part of a peace process.",
      "\u201cI said to him that he is a liar,\u201d Zelenskyy said he told Trump about Putin, adding that he urged the U.S. president to increase pressure on Putin because, he said, \"I don\u2019t trust him.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said it\u2019s important that no decisions about Ukraine are made without Ukraine. He also said that in his first phone call with Joe Biden, the then-president told him Ukraine could not join NATO. The United States \u201cnever saw us in NATO,\u201d Zelenskyy told attendees. \u201cThey just spoke about it, but they really didn\u2019t want us in NATO.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s security conference comes amid growing concerns over what actions Moscow might take if it is handed a win in Ukraine, particularly amid Trump\u2019s suggestions that the U.S. would not defend NATO allies if they are attacked.",
      "Last year, NATO members\u00a0had indicated that Ukraine was on an \u201cirreversible path\u201d to eventual membership in the alliance. But both Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have indicated that NATO membership and Ukraine regaining lost territory are effectively off the table.",
      "Earlier, Vance may have offered European allies some reassurance in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, warning that Russia could face more sanctions and even military action if it refuses to agree to a deal ensuring Ukraine\u2018s\u00a0long-term independence.",
      "\u201cThere are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,\u201d Vance told the newspaper, describing the possible pressures the U.S. could apply. \u201cThere are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence.\u201d",
      "He did not expand on those comments during his address at Friday's security conference.",
      "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Friday condemned any plan for peace talks that does not involve Ukrainians and Europeans.",
      "\u201cA sham peace \u2014 over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans \u2014 would gain nothing,\u201d Baerbock said in a statement as the security conference got underway. \u201cA sham peace would not bring lasting security, neither for the people in Ukraine nor for us in Europe or the United States,\u201d she said, according to Reuters.",
      "Baerbock called for talks between U.S. and international partners to be held at the Munich conference, an annual gathering of political and military leaders, as well as diplomats."

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 For years, the Palestinian-owned Educational Bookshop in east Jerusalem has been a rare island of dialogue in an increasingly divided city, but an Israeli police raid on the store this week has sparked fears about the suppression of free speech.",
      "While the well-known store and its smaller branch across the street were open Tuesday, the bust saw detectives confiscate books in trash bags and arrest two members of the owner\u2019s family. The incident has raised broader concerns about the status of shared places where Israelis and Palestinians can peacefully come together and debate.",
      "\u201cI, like many diplomats, enjoy browsing for books at Educational Bookshop. I know its owners, the Muna family, to be peace-loving proud Palestinian Jerusalemites, open for discussion and intellectual exchange,\u201d Steffen Seibert, Germany\u2019s ambassador to Israel, said in a post on X.",
      "\u201cI am concerned to hear of the raid and their detention in prison,\u201d he added.",
      "The store, founded on Salah al-Din Street in 1984 by the Muna family, sells books in many languages that largely focus on the Middle East and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has long been known in the area as an intellectual oasis where readers from across the political divide can share ideas.",
      "Security footage from Sunday afternoon that the Muna family shared with NBC News showed plainclothes officers rifling through books and taking away some of them in garbage bags.",
      "During the raid on the predominantly English-language store, officers also arrested the manager, Mahmoud Muna, and his nephew Ahmad. Both have since been released.",
      "Mahmoud\u2019s brother, Morad, said that the police had taken books with a Palestinian flag or icon printed on them and that they used Google Translate to help understand what the material was saying.",

      "A spokesperson from the Israeli police said that the two were arrested on suspicion of \u201cselling books containing incitement and support for terrorism at bookstores in Jerusalem.\u201d",
      "Police added that the detectives had confiscated from the store \u201cnumerous books containing inciteful material,\u201d pointing to the children\u2019s coloring book titled \u201cFrom the River to the Sea,\u201d written by South African author Nathi Ngubane, as one example. The police added that they had also raided a bookshop in Jerusalem\u2019s Old City last week, which had material supporting Hamas, Hezbollah and the Islamic State group.",
      "The title of the coloring book is also a pro-Palestinian slogan often used at protests against Israel and refers to the geographical area between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea that encompasses Israel and the Palestinian territories.",
      "The American Jewish Committee says on its website that the slogan \u201ccan be used to call for the elimination of the State of Israel and/or ethnic cleansing of Jews living there,\u201d while the South Africa Jewish Board of Deputies protested the publication of the book when it was initially released.",
      "Wasim Khalis, who owns a clothing store next door to Educational Bookshop, said he had been drinking coffee in the bookstore around 3 p.m. local time when four plainclothes officers entered. After a few minutes, he said, the officers flashed a warrant and asked customers to leave, while a second group of officers went across the street to another store owned by the family.",
      "\u201cIt was very strange,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a new store; it has been here for decades. They took items that were very normal and could be found anywhere, including on the internet.\u201d",
      "Some 10 diplomats including those from the European Union and the United Kingdom sat in on a debate Monday on the Munas\u2019 release date at Jerusalem\u2019s District Court. Meanwhile, supporters of the Educational Bookstore wrote about their alarm at the raid online, with a smaller number gathering outside the courthouse.",
      "\u201cWe fear that the raid on the store, the confiscation of books from it, and the imprisonment of its owner under the pretext of \u2018violating public order\u2019 is a regime provocation designed to erase the Palestinian cultural narrative and harass those involved in it,\u201d Israeli author Ilan Sheinfeld said in a post on X.",
      "One of the in-person protesters was Galit Samuel, an Israeli patron who had traveled from Tel Aviv to be there. She said of the Munas that \u201cthey are both men of peace, and they are promoting Palestinian culture in peaceful ways.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable that such people were arrested and books were confiscated,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a grave attack on free speech and free thinking.\u201d"

      "Those concerns were repeatedly echoed by the U.S. military, which said in a statement last month that the prison population was \u201ca literal and figurative \u2018ISIS Army\u2019 in detention.\u201d",

      "Inside the camp, in a section dubbed The Annex, the wives of foreign ISIS fighters and their children are held, around 6,000 people from 51 countries. Many of their governments have shown little or no interest in repatriating them in the six or so years they have languished in the camp.",

      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.\u00a0The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 20 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

      "LONDON \u2014 Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season\u2019s Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",

      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that\u2019s planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",
      "Given the number of injuries sustained by Arsenal players this season \u2014 others to have had long spells out include Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2014 some have questioned whether Arteta\u2019s training methods are to blame.",
      "Maybe that was the reason why Arteta was eager to point out that Arsenal\u2019s players now \u201ctrain less than ever\u201d and go into a deeper explanation about how too many games \u2014 and, as a result, not enough training \u2014 affects players\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cThe muscle is undertrained and then you expose the muscle and the tendon to an exposure that they cannot absorb because the tendon needs 72 hours to recover,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cA lot of people talk about what we\u2019re doing outside. It\u2019s not outside, it\u2019s inside.",
      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d"

      "BANGKOK \u2014 Some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar, Thailand\u2019s army announced Thursday.",
      "In a fresh crackdown on scam centers operating from Southeast Asia, the Thai army said it was coordinating an effort to repatriate some 260 people believed to have been victims of human trafficking after they were rescued and sent from Myanmar to Thailand.",
      "Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have become known as havens for criminal syndicates that are estimated to have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have extracted tens of billions of dollars from victims around the world, according to U.N. experts, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023 after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state along its border. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.",
      "The army said that those rescued in the most recent operation came from 20 nationalities \u2014 with significant numbers from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan and China. There were also nationals of Indonesia, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, Laos, Brazil, Burundi, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana and India. They were sent across the border from Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy district to Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Wednesday.",
      "Reports in Thai media said a Myanmar ethnic militia that controls the area where they were held, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, was responsible for freeing the workers and taking them to the border. Myanmar\u2019s military government exercises little control over frontier areas where ethnic minorities predominate.",
      "Several ethnic militias are believed to be involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking and protecting call-center scam operations.",
      "The Thai army statement said the rescued people will undergo questioning, and if determined to be victims of human trafficking, will enter a process of protection while waiting to be sent back to their countries.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who is also defense minister, said Wednesday that there might be many more scam workers waiting to be repatriated from Myanmar through Thailand, but that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their country of origin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that Thailand is not going to set up another shelter,\u201d he told reporters during a visit in Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. Thailand hosts nine refugee camps along the border holding more than 100,000 people, most from Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Karen minority.",
      "Phumtham added that Thailand would also need to question them before sending them back, both to make sure that they are victims of human trafficking, and also to get information that would help the police investigate the trafficking and scam problems.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with Chinese leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks that plague Southeast Asia.",
      "Many dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Bangkok only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar have surfaced. Chinese actor Wang Xing was a high-profile case but was quickly rescued after his tale spread on social media.",
      "Underlining Beijing\u2019s concern, Liu Zhongyi, China\u2019s vice minister of public security and commissioner of its Criminal Investigation Bureau, made an official visit to Thailand last month and inspected the border area opposite where many of the Myanmar scam centers are located.",
      "Just ahead of Paetongtarn\u2019s visit to China, the Thai government issued an order to cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border with northern Thailand, citing national security and severe damage that the country has suffered from scam operations.",
      "Her government is considering expanding this measure to Thailand\u2019s northeastern areas bordering Cambodia, said Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Thanathip Sawangsang, who explained that officials had already removed internet cables that were installed in the areas illegally."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 A man from Memphis, Tennessee, was sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife during their honeymoon in Fiji in 2022, a court official said Friday.",
      "Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, will have to serve at least 18 years in prison before he can be considered for release, a Fiji High Court registry official in Lautoka said.",
      "Dawson was convicted in December of murdering his wife, Christe Chen, who was then 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in the South Pacific nation. He then fled by kayak to a nearby island.",
      "He was sentenced by Justice Riyaz Hamza on Wednesday.",
      "Hamza told Dawson he had shown disregard for Chen\u2019s right to life and her personal liberty.",
      "\u201cYour conduct after the incident was appalling. Having inflicted serious and life-threatening injuries to the deceased you fled the scene of the crime, leaving the deceased alone and helpless,\u201d Hamza said, according to The Fiji Times newspaper.",
      "Chen\u2019s body was discovered in the couple\u2019s room by resort staff with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head after the couple was heard arguing and did not appear at breakfast or lunch the next day.",
      "Dawson pleaded not guilty to the charge and was tried over eight days.",
      "His lawyer Anil Prasad told the court that prosecutors had failed to provide sufficient evidence to convict Dawson, the Fijian Broadcasting Corp. reported.",
      "Prasad said that while the prosecution alleged that Dawson was planning to flee Fiji, authorities failed to acknowledge that many of the couple\u2019s personal belongings remained at the resort.",
      "Prasad also said Dawson had no injuries to suggest he had been involved in a physical altercation with his wife.",
      "But the judge said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dawson and no one else had committed the crime.",
      "Under Fijian law, prisoners can apply for parole after serving a minimum term set by a court, although the parole board is currently unstaffed. Critics argue the lack of an effective parole option is a cause of prison overcrowding.",
      "David Naylor, an Australian National University expert on Pacific law and regulation who has lectured in Fiji, said that after serving 18 years in prison, Dawson could apply to the national Mercy Commission to be released with a pardon from the Fijian president.",
      "He could also apply for his life sentence to be reduced to a fixed term, which would set a release date, Naylor said.",
      "Dawson worked in the information technology department at Youth Villages, a nonprofit child welfare and support organization based in Memphis. An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.",
      "The Turtle Island resort, where the pair stayed, is an exclusive and remote island that accommodates only 14 couples at a time. Yasawa is a group of about 20 volcanic islands in the west of Fiji, a nation of 930,000 people."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump last month signed an executive order that issued a blanket pause on U.S. foreign aid.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration must temporarily allow the disbursement of foreign aid, a judge ruled Thursday, dealing the latest blow to the administration's sweeping efforts to halt international aid.",
      "The court order came in response to a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups that work on international aid projects,\u00a0as well as other organizations.",
      "They had asked that the judge block the executive order President Donald Trump signed last month that implemented a blanket pause on U.S. foreign aid. Secretary of State Marco Rubio subsequently ordered an immediate halt to nearly all U.S. foreign assistance.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Rather than rule against the entire executive order, U.S. District Judge Amir Ali made a narrower decision Thursday, saying the administration for now could not suspend or cancel foreign assistance that was in place before Trump took office.",
      "Ali said, however, that \"the Court does not find it appropriate or necessary to enjoin the President or the Executive Order itself.\"",
      "The judge said in his ruling that the administration has not yet \"meaningfully contested detailed and credible evidence of harm to countless American businesses, ranging from shutting down programs, to furloughing and laying off employees, to shuttering altogether.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.",
      "Global Health Council, one of the plaintiffs, praised the ruling in a news release. Its president, Elisha Dunn-Georgiou, said the ruling was \"a vital first step toward restoring U.S. foreign assistance programs.\"",
      "\u201cIt clears the path for organizations to resume their life saving work, showcasing the best of American values: compassion, leadership, and a commitment to global health, stability, and shared prosperity,\" Dunn-Georgiou said.",
      "The judge instructed the parties to file a joint status report by 5 p.m. Friday regarding further legal proceedings.",
      "The White House had targeted the U.S. Agency for International Development shortly after Trump's executive order pausing foreign aid. Thousands of employees and contractors were fired, furloughed or placed on administrative leave.",
      "USAID delivers billions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid, but Trump and Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency, have argued it is wasteful. Musk has called USAID a \"criminal organization.\""

      "The fossil of a Jurassic bird unearthed in southeastern China has major implications for the history of avian evolution, researchers say.",
      "The newly discovered Baminornis zhenghensis, a quail-sized bird, roamed the skies some 150 million years ago during the Jurassic period, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature, meaning it is among the oldest birds known to mankind, along with the iconic Archaeopteryx that was discovered in Germany in 1862 and is of similar age.",
      "\u201cFor more than 150 years now, Archaeopteryx has stood alone,\u201d said Steve Brusatte, a University of Edinburgh paleontologist who wrote a commentary accompanying the study.",
      "\u201cDuring all of that time, it has remained as the only unquestionable bird fossil from the Jurassic Period,\u201d he told NBC News in an email.",
      "While there have been other birdlike Jurassic fossils found here and there, Brusatte said, there was a \u201chuge mystery and a frustrating gap\u201d in the fossil record: If Archaeopteryx was flying by then, other birds must have been too. So where were their fossils?",
      "The 2023 discovery of Baminornis in Zhenghe county in China\u2019s Fujian province, now among the most important discoveries since Archaeopteryx, helps fill that gap, he said, making it the \u201csecond unquestioned bird from the Jurassic Period.\u201d",
      "Min Wang, the lead author of the study, said it was a \"very exciting\" discovery.",
      "\u201cThese two fossil birds have systematically changed our understanding about the earliest evolution of birds,\" the paleontologist from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences told NBC News in an email.",
      "\"They demonstrate that the origin of birds is much earlier than current thought.\"",
      "Unlike the half-bird, half-reptile Archaeopteryx, which had a long and skinny tail similar to that of a velociraptor, Baminornis had a short tail with some of its vertebrae fused into a short, stubby nubbin called a\u00a0pygostyle \u2014 a crucial aerodynamic feature that pushes the body\u2019s center of mass toward the wings, similar to those in modern-day birds that help them fly better.",
      "Until the discovery of Baminornis, short tails had been found only in birds known to have lived around 20 million years later,\u00a0such as Eoconfuciusornis and Protopteryx.",
      "\u201cWhat excites me most is that it is a more advanced bird than Archaeopteryx, and it could fly much better,\u201d Brusatte said.",
      "Baminornis was much more anatomically complex than Archaeopteryx, which Brusatte said was a \u201cprimitive\u201d bird with claws and sharp teeth like its dinosaur ancestors.",
      "Archaeopteryx, which played a crucial role in determining that today\u2019s birds evolved from dinosaurs, was a \u201ctextbook example of a creature caught in the act of evolution like a freeze frame,\u201d he added.",
      "The vast difference between the two similarly aged birds, discovered about 5,500 miles apart, has led the team behind the Nature study to believe that avian evolution occurred millions of years earlier than previously thought, with the estimate now at about 164 to 172 million years ago.",
      "In addition to dozens of fossils of aquatic or semiaquatic animals, the Zhenghe Fauna collection, as it\u2019s referred to, includes at least three fossils so far that belong to the group including birds and their closest relatives. The researchers said this suggests the collection holds great potential to \u201cenrich our understanding of early bird diversification\u201d and \u201cfill a critical gap in the evolutionary history of terrestrial ecosystem\u201d toward the end of the Jurassic period.",
      "Though the Baminornis fossil preserved much of the skeleton, the feathers were not preserved, leaving unanswered questions about the size and structure of its wings. It was also missing the skull, limiting clues about the bird\u2019s diet.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cBaminornis tells us that a variety of birds lived during the Jurassic, and they flew in different ways,\u201d Brusatte said."

      "PUNTA ARENAS, Chile \u2014 A\u00a0humpback whale\u00a0briefly swallowed a kayaker off Chilean Patagonia before quickly releasing him unharmed. The incident, caught on camera, quickly went viral.",
      "Last Saturday, Adri\u00e1n Simancas was kayaking with his father, Dell, in Bah\u00eda El \u00c1guila near the San Isidro Lighthouse in the Strait of Magellan when a humpback whale surfaced, engulfing Adri\u00e1n and his yellow kayak for a few seconds before letting him go.",
      "Dell, just yards away, captured the moment on video while encouraging his son to stay calm.",
      "\u201cStay calm, stay calm,\u201d he can be heard saying after his son was released from the whale\u2019s mouth.",
      "\u201cI thought I was dead,\u201d Adri\u00e1n told The Associated Press. \u201cI thought it had eaten me, that it had swallowed me.\u201d",
      "He described the \u201cterror\u201d of those few seconds and explained that his real fear set in only after resurfacing, fearing that the huge animal would hurt his father or that he would perish in the frigid waters.",
      "Despite the terrifying experience, Dell remained focused, filming and reassuring his son while grappling with his own worry.",
      "\u201cWhen I came up and started floating, I was scared that something might happen to my father too, that we wouldn\u2019t reach the shore in time, or that I would get hypothermia,\u201d Adri\u00e1n said.",
      "After a few seconds in the water, Adri\u00e1n managed to reach his father\u2019s kayak and was quickly assisted. Despite the scare, both returned to shore uninjured.",
      "Located about 1,600 miles south of Santiago, Chile\u2019s capital, the Strait of Magellan is a major tourist attraction in the Chilean Patagonia, known for adventure activities.",
      "Its frigid waters pose a challenge for sailors, swimmers and explorers who attempt to cross it in different ways.",
      "Although it\u2019s summer in the Southern Hemisphere, temperatures in the region remain cool, with minimums dropping to 39 degrees Fahrenheit and highs rarely exceeding 68 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "While whale attacks on humans are extremely rare in Chilean waters, whale deaths from collisions with cargo ships have increased in recent years, and\u00a0strandings have become a recurring issue\u00a0in the last decade."
