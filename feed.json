      "In her on-court TV interview, Keys alluded to the podcast that she and Pegula, along with several other WTA players, do. It's called \u201c The Player\u2019s Box \u201d and it chronicles everyday life on tour.",

      "Pegula, who launched the podcast with Keys, Jennifer Brady, and Desirae Krawczyk during last year\u2019s U.S. Open, said she noticed the possible head-to-head contest midway through the tournament.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles III has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film about his vision for saving the planet, 16 years after he wrote a book on the subject",
      "LONDON -- Can it be that, like many baby boomers, King Charles III feels misunderstood?",
      "That might sound like a strange question for a man with his own public relations team and easy access to any journalist in the realm. But 16 years after he wrote a book explaining his vision for saving the planet, the king has teamed up with Amazon Prime to make a film spelling out that philosophy.",
      "The documentary delves into Charles\u2019 concept of \u201charmony,\u201d the idea that restoring the balance between the human and natural worlds is crucial to combatting global warming and many other major problems facing humanity.",
      "Along the way, the king also confronts his critics, who have lampooned him as a dilettante flitting aimlessly from one cause to another with no rhyme or reason. Charles believes that climate change, urban planning, sustainable agriculture, traditional crafts and fostering understanding between religions \u2014 causes to which he has devoted much of his adult life \u2014 are inter-related issues that must be dealt with to create more liveable communities.",
      "\u201cI think we need to follow harmony if we are going to ensure that this planet can support so many,\u2019\u2019 he said in a trailer for the film. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s anywhere else.\u2019\u2019",
      "To help explain these ideas, experts including Tony Juniper, the former head of Friends of the Earth in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Emily Shuckburgh, a University of Cambridge climate scientist, appear with Charles in \u201cFinding Harmony: A King\u2019s Vision,\u201d available on Amazon from Feb. 6. The narrator is Kate Winslet.",
      "The king wants people to recognize that humans are as much a part of the natural world as the birds and the trees, something that can be obscured as we rush to work in air-conditioned offices, then drive to the supermarket to buy food wrapped in plastic, Juniper told The Associated Press.",
      "The \u201ccycles and loops\u201d of nature are still what govern human society, Juniper said, and reconnecting with that is critical as we confront global warming, soil erosion, ocean plastics and the chemicals building up in our food chains.",
      "\u201cAll of that is reversible, all of that fixable,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to require more of us to understand that we are not outside nature, we are in it.\u201d",
      "Juniper believes Charles is uniquely qualified to deliver this message because he has been campaigning on these issues for decades and continues to do so even as other world leaders shun environmental protection.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s one person in the world who is literally a globally recognized figure, who has authenticity derived from an incredible track record on these subjects, it is King Charles III,\u201d Juniper said.",
      "Charles addressed the idea of restoring balance in the natural world in his 2010 book \u201cHarmony: A New Way of Looking at Our World,\u201d written with Juniper and Ian Skelly, a former BBC presenter.",
      "So why return to the subject now?",
      "Part of it may be the hope of reaching a new audience through a streaming service with global reach. Prince William, Charles\u2019 heir, ventured into the same space last year when he revealed his plans for the monarchy on comedian Eugene Levy\u2019s Apple TV show \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "But the king also wants to shift the focus back to an issue he hopes will define his legacy after two years in which the media, and the public, were distracted by other matters, said Ed Owens, author of \u201cAfter Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?\u201d",
      "First there was Charles\u2019 cancer diagnosis, which forced him to step away from public duties for several months in early 2024 and raised nagging questions about his health. Then there were the continuing tensions with his younger son, Prince Harry, and the scandal surrounding his brother Andrew\u2019s links to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

      "Charles gave his first speech on the environment in February 1970, when he was just 21 and still a student at Cambridge.",
      "In 1990, he founded Dumfries House, the flagship project of the King\u2019s Foundation, to promote sustainable agriculture, traditional arts and crafts, health and well-being.",
      "The house and surrounding 2,000-acre estate in southwestern Scotland operate as a laboratory of sorts for the philosophy of harmony, offering courses that seek to teach the principles of nature while preparing students to work on farms, in hotels and restaurants \u2014 and on construction sites.",
      "Among those who is attending a course at Dumfries House is Jennie Regan, 45, who is training to be a stonemason after 15 years as a university administrator.",
      "On a recent afternoon, Regan stood proudly behind a carving she created bearing the inscription \u201cHave I not guided you well?\u201d \u2014 a nod to the story of the benevolent Scottish fairy Ghillie Dhu who led a lost child to safety.",

      "Shuckburgh, who collaborated with the king on a children\u2019s book about climate change, said the documentary offers a hopeful vision for addressing the challenges facing the world.",
      "\u201cIt feels as though we\u2019re living through difficult times,\u2019\u2019 said Shuckburgh, director of Cambridge Zero, the university\u2019s effort to address the climate crisis. \u201cHaving something that provides that sense of hope and optimism is really, really important.\"",

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival is in full swing, with Channing Tatum, Olivia Wilde and Charli xcx movies premiering back-to-back at the storied Eccles Theatre Friday evening in Park City, Utah. Considered some of the hottest tickets at the festival, the waitlists are already long, and the lines will surely be longer.",
      "First up is \u201cJosephine,\u201d writer-director Beth De Ara\u00fajo\u2019s raw drama about an 8-year-old girl (Mason Reeves) whose life and sense of safety is upended after she witnesses a crime in Golden Gate Park. Tatum and Gemma Chan play the parents who are unsure how to help her navigate these new emotions and fears. The film, which is part of the U.S. Dramatic Competition, is based on De Ara\u00fajo\u2019s own experience of seeing something scarring at that age.",
      "The next film, Gregg Araki\u2019s \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d will bring a distinct change in tone to the Eccles. It\u2019s the story of a college graduate in his early 20s (played by Cooper Hoffman ) who gets his first job as a kind of intern/assistant to a renowned art world provocateur named Erika Tracy (Wilde), who Arkai described as \u201cbold, daring and very controversial,\u201d a cross between Robert Mapplethorpe and Madonna.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the story of their affairs and the impact it has on this kid\u2019s life and how it kind of turns his whole world upside down,\u201d Araki told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s colorful, it\u2019s sexy. And it\u2019s a ride.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a film that Araki has been working on for over 10 years, as it evolved from a comic \u201cFifty Shades of Grey\u201d with a female intern to what it is now.",
      "\u201cAfter #MeToo and Harvey Weinstein, all the stuff that was going on, it was literally like, I don\u2019t really want to see a woman getting dragged around by the hair,\u201d Araki said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to seed that kind of patriarchal dynamic, even if it\u2019s consensual.\u201d",
      "Flipping the gender roles and making the young intern a man made the movie more interesting for Araki, \u201cas a filmmaker who has always been heavily influenced by feminist film theory and feminism in general,\u201d he said.",
      "At the same time, he was absorbing news stories about Gen Z and how they don\u2019t have sex or relationships anymore and a new dynamic emerged.",
      "\u201cWhat I knew as an old person, as an old-timer, in terms of socialization, dating, sex, all of this stuff that seemed to be kind of falling away,\u201d Araki said. \u201cAnd so that kind of became a major theme of the movie.\u201d",
      "Things Wilde\u2019s character says are things he has also said in interviews about sex and sexuality. Her character gets into generational debates about it. And ultimately it's sex positive.",
      "\u201cIt was very important to me to make something sex positive,\u201d Araki said. \u201c\u2019I Want Your Sex\u2019 is like the opposite of \u2018Babygirl,\u2019 which I found to be very sex negative.\u201d",
      "The film also features a supporting turn from Charli xcx, who was a fan of Araki and whose \u201cBrat\u201d album cover was partially inspired by the title credits to his film \u201cSmiley Face.\u201d When she heard about this new movie, he said, she asked if she could be in it. He was interested, but told her agent that she needed to do a self-tape \u201clike everyone else\u201d to play the part of Hoffman\u2019s girlfriend.",

      "NEW YORK -- A reality TV series meant to spotlight the New York Police Department has spawned a real-life legal drama involving the city and the show\u2019s producer, Jordan McGraw \u2014 the son of TV\u2019s \u201cDr. Phil\u201d McGraw.",
      "The city sued the younger McGraw and his production company this week for breach of contract and obtained a court order that blocks them, at least temporarily, from selling or disseminating any footage from the unfinished and unaired show, tentatively titled \u201cBehind the Badge.\u201d",
      "\"Dr. Phil\" McGraw\u2014 a clinical psychologist turned TV personality \u2014 hosted the series, interviewing officials and showing up to crime scenes. Episodes were slated to air on his MeritTV cable and streaming channels, where he'd previously done segments featuring the police department.",
      "On Thursday, McGraw\u2019s lawyers filed to move the case from New York state court to federal court.",
      "The city abandoned \u201cBehind the Badge\u201d late last year, hours before then-Mayor Eric Adams ceded City Hall to Zohran Mamdani, after saying that it had expressed concerns to McGraw about the documentary-style show\u2019s quality and content.",
      "Episode \u201crough cuts\u201d provided to the city by McGraw\u2019s company, McGraw Media, were mostly \u201cunedited footage\u201d dumps and included material not allowed under McGraw\u2019s production agreement with the city, such as discussions of sensitive operations and the identities of undercover officers, crime victims and witnesses, the lawsuit said.",
      "\u201cIntended to highlight the extraordinary work of the NYPD\u201d with special behind-the-scenes access, \u201cBehind the Badge\u201d at times portrayed the nation\u2019s largest police force negatively, violating the agreement, the lawsuit said.",
      "Jordan McGraw and McGraw Media have since \u201cdisavowed their obligations\u201d and attempted to wrest editorial control over the project from the city, \u201crisking immediate and irreparable harm\u201d to the city, the lawsuit said.",
      "Chip Babcock, a lawyer for Jordan McGraw and McGraw Media, said the lawsuit came as a surprise \u201cas publication of any programming was not imminent.\" McGraw Media, he said, \u201chad worked with the city to address the edits requested\" and is willing to continue to do so. The company will seek to remove the court order as soon as possible, Babcock said, calling it a presumptively unconstitutional prior restraint.",
      "New York City partnered with McGraw Media on \u201cBehind the Badge\u201d last April, inking a three-year contract a day after a federal judge dismissed federal corruption charges against Adams. The case went away, in part, because the Justice Department had wanted the mayor\u2019s help with President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "Last week, WNBC-TV reported that Adams' campaign paid $500,000 for another Jordan McGraw company, Fairfax Digital, to produce social media ads.",

      "The unexpected and cheeky exchange came in the administration's appeal of a ruling by a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit, one of the most conservative courts in the country, that found Trump inappropriately used the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 when he targeted the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua last year.",
      "The act has only been invoked three other times in American history, during the War of 1812 and both world wars. A majority of the three-judge panel agreed in last year's ruling with multiple lower court judges and immigration lawyers who brought the case that it cannot be deployed against a gang rather than a belligerent foreign power.",
      "The administration appealed to the full 5th Circuit, and all 17 judges on the court were present for the arguments in New Orleans on Thursday.",

      "\u201cTren de Aragua is committing ordinary crimes that are being dealt with by law enforcement,\u201d Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the ACLU, told the judges. \u201cThe Alien Enemies Act is about wartime and it's about the military.\u201d",
      "Several of the judges were concerned about second-guessing the president's determination of a threat to the country. Ensign noted the law allows it to be invoked in attempts of \u201cinvasion\u201d or \u201cpredatory incursion\u201d and argued that courts should accept a president's declaration that that is happening.",
      "\u201cA predatory incursion is less than an invasion,\u201d Ensign said, arguing that cases involving other laws have determined it happens when foreign fishing boats enter U.S. waters. He also noted that Trump alleged the gang was acting at the behest of recently ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government \u2014 an assertion that has been challenged by some law enforcement analysts.",
      "It's unclear when the circuit will issue its ruling, and the final decision on the constitutionality of Trump's action will likely be made by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The nation's highest court has already had to wade into the tangled legal saga of Trump's invocation of the act twice before. His administration used the act to fly 252 Venezuelans from the United States to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where it contended that U.S. judges had no authority. The Supreme Court ruled that anyone else the administration tried to remove under the act needed a \u201creasonable\u201d opportunity to challenge their designation as a gang member in court.",
      "The following month, as the administration hurried to prepare another flight from Texas, the high court issued an unusual midnight ruling halting flights. It also barred removals under the act until the 5th Circuit could sort out the proper procedures. The high court never weighed in on the constitutionality of Trump's use of the act, giving the 5th Circuit first crack at that question as well.",

      "Leonardo DiCaprio picked up his sixth lead actor Oscar nomination Thursday morning for carrying the American masterpiece \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d as the overwhelmed single dad and flustered revolutionary Bob Ferguson.",
      "Ten years after he won best actor for \u201cThe Revenant,\u201d it\u2019s a statistic that puts him in a rarefied group that includes Daniel Day-Lewis. Including his supporting nomination for \u201cWhat\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape,\u201d he\u2019s now among a group of only eight actors, male or female, to have achieved that milestone. Overall, he has eight nominations to his name, including a best picture credit for \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street.\u201d",
      "But for DiCaprio, a consummate director\u2019s actor who spoke to The Associated Press by phone Thursday morning, the most important thing isn\u2019t even necessarily the accolades but being part of a film that\u2019s as timeless as \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love what I do,\u201d DiCaprio said in a phone interview. \u201cAt the end of the day it\u2019s about trying to be in films that are memorable. This is a great addition to have your peers sort of recognize it.\u201d",
      "In Bob Ferguson, DiCaprio got one of his greatest roles in an already illustrious career. It\u2019s a performance that\u2019s not easy to define but that spotlighted his grasp on his craft to maximum effect, allowing him to be funny, emotional, intimate and utterly authentic, whether he\u2019s yelling about not remembering a passcode, reading his daughter\u2019s friend the riot act or even just wordlessly looking at Sean Penn\u2019s antagonist Colonel Steven J. Lockjaw with all the fear in the world for his daughter in his eyes.",
      "It\u2019s not often that Oscar nominated performances also become cultural touchstones, but this Halloween there were more than a few men and women donning Bob\u2019s plaid bathrobe, black beanie and blockers on the streets around the country.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fantastic,\u201d DiCaprio said. \u201cA film like this, a film that had so much thought put into it for 20 plus years in Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s mind, a film that\u2019s so topical and pertinent, a film that I got to work with so many of my heroes, a director who\u2019s my hero? \u2026 It flows freely off the tongue to be able to promote and talk about it. It's a piece of art that you\u2019re proud of and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to be in this film.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s one he hopes audiences revisit time and time again, finding new interpretations, new ways of looking and their characters and their intentions. The film received 13 nominations overall, second only to \u201cSinners,\u201d including best picture, best director and supporting actor nominations for Benicio Del Toro and Penn.",
      "One of the bigger snubs of the day, though, was DiCaprio\u2019s co-star Chase Infiniti, an integral part of the film as his daughter Willa who was not nominated for lead actress. DiCaprio said he\u2019d just spoken to her and that she had \u201can amazing attitude\u201d about it.",

She should be so proud of herself and we\u2019re all so proud of her.\u201d",
      "Between the \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d and \u201cSinners\u201d nominations, it was a big morning for Warner Bros., a studio whose future is uncertain, with many wondering if films like \u201cOne Battle\u201d would be made under Netflix, or if talent like Anderson or DiCaprio would be part of it. DiCaprio demurred on commenting specifically on the pending acquisition, instead championing original filmmaking and theatrical moviegoing.",
      "\u201cTo me what matters is great ideas and original filmmaking. I think there\u2019s this tide of change that is going to happen no matter how we feel about it,\u201d DiCaprio said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the theatrical experience to immerse you and have the rest of the world disappear and feel part of something else, something bigger, something different. That\u2019s the magic of movies. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s our greatest art form and I hope the theatrical experience remains alive, but that\u2019s up to audiences and their appreciation of that art form.\u201d",
      "DiCaprio might have a tendency to be turned into memes sometimes, whether it\u2019s that image of him walking in \u201cInception\u201d or even animatedly talking to someone at the Golden Globes about \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d (Laughing, he told the AP that he was talking to a friend who will remain anonymous).",
      "Perhaps it\u2019s because he saves it all for the screen and for great filmmakers, whether it\u2019s Anderson, Martin Scorsese or Christopher Nolan. In a dark theater, 30 feet tall and impossible to look away from, all the noise evaporates.",

The film is a story about love in all its messy incarnations, centered on a single father in Cleveland, Ohio, whose small medical practice is struggling, whose divorce is complicated and whose teenage daughter (Abby Ryder Fortson) is slipping into depression when his high school girlfriend ( Jenny Slate ) comes back to town and they start up again.",
      "Pine felt himself leaning into the script, wanting to know more about the characters and the filmmaker behind it. After watching Lambert\u2019s previous film, \u201cSometimes I Think About Dying,\u201d he saw a filmmaker whose cinematic vision was so unique, so distinctly her own that he joined \u201cCarousel\u201d not just as the star but a producer as well.",
      "Lambert had admired Pine from afar for years, for his intelligence and sensitivity on screen, and saw potential for him in the part of Noah.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a rareness to him that I don\u2019t see very often in performers,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cHe reminds me of Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant, these sort of towers of performers.\u201d",
      "The actual experience of it turned out to be more special than she could have dreamed. Yes, he showed up as an actor, generous and receptive, but he also became a protector of sorts as well. Knowing how much Lambert wanted to shoot both in America and on film, two relatively expensive dreams for an indie, he made his own participation contingent on celluloid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous act that I think about a lot,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cThere are very few films shot in America and there are very few films shot on film \u2026 it lends a kind of extra emotional layer to the viewing experience.\u201d",
      "For Lambert, shooting on film was an act of preservation. This was a story that she dreamed up during COVID lockdowns at her childhood home, a location she also used in \u201cCarousel.\u201d The homespun feeling of it added a texture and intimacy to the environment, whether it was using her mom\u2019s frozen fruit as a prop or literally chopping down a tree in the backyard, as Slate\u2019s character Rebecca does at one point.",
      "\u201cYou just plunk right into whatever that closeness or intimacy is,\u201d Slate said.",
      "Chemistry is always a gamble, especially in indies where there\u2019s never enough time or money, but Lambert was blown away by just how well Pine and Slate worked out as these two characters attempting to start up again after many years apart.",
      "\u201cWe just had an immediate affinity for one another,\u201d Pine said. \u201cJenny is so smart, and I\u2019m sort of a lover of smart people, so immediately she had me. And she likes to laugh and she makes me giggle. So we just had a really, really easy time getting to know one another.\u201d",

      "While actors can wax poetic about how much they like and respect one another, ultimately it's what\u2019s on screen that counts. Lambert remembered getting chills (the good kind) when shooting Rebecca and Noah\u2019s second first kiss.",
      "\u201cIsn\u2019t it so good to have kissing on screen,\u201d Slate said. \u201cShooting that scene felt to me like it was in slow motion. It felt like such a beautiful thing to enact, really. But I mean, also that\u2019s something that you get with another actor who\u2019s really, really focused on landing it just right.\u201d",
      "Of course, love is never as simple as it is in the movies, and Lambert wanted to reflect that in \u201cCarousel.\u201d At its heart there is a central romantic love story, but there are other love stories refracted throughout, through their families and professions. None are obstacles that need to be overcome exactly, but they\u2019re part of the fabric of a life.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this mantra I have already: 'Have you ever wanted something so much in life you do all you could not to get it? That\u2019s what Noah is going through,\u201d Lambert said. \u201cHe wants so much to love this person, Rebecca, to feel love, to feel renewed. But there\u2019s all these other repairs he must attend to and all these fears he must attend to. I wanted to take that seriously.\u201d",
      "Lambert is hesitant to prescribe what an audience might feel when watching her film. For her actors, though, it meant one of the richer creative experiences of their careers, getting to hone their craft in a way that might really resonate with audiences and speak to the human experience.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an earnest, heartfelt, non-jaded, non-cool investigation of the deepest fundamentals of what we humans do on the planet, which is, you know, how do we love?\u201d Pine said. \u201cThere\u2019s no gimmick here. There\u2019s no hold up, no spaceship, no great effects. The metronome to this film is very paced and deliberate and it requires a patience to allow yourself to be drawn into the spectacle of human beings.\u201d",
      "For Lambert, Sundance is a homecoming and the only place she\u2019d have wanted it. \u201cCarousel\u201d is a proudly independent American film made on location, and Sundance is, whether in Colorado or Utah, the quintessential independent American film festival.",
      "\u201cWhat better platform does America provide for cinematic artists?\u201d Lambert said. \u201cThis film is American and, quietly, has a lot to say about America right now, and where we\u2019re going.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s not often we get to pay tribute, in full, to our giants while they\u2019re still with us. But in \u201cMel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!\u201d Judd Apatow dutifully and affectionately celebrates the laugh-filled life of a comedy legend who\u2019s still here to tell the story \u2014 and the jokes \u2014 himself.",
      "\u201cThe 99 Year Old Man,\u201d which debuts Thursday in two parts on HBO and HBO Max, is a big-hearted tribute to Brooks, an indefatigable comic force who did more than most anyone to lighten the mood of the 20th century. At 99 (he\u2019ll turn 100 in June), Brooks remains a remarkably great raconteur.",
      "One of the cleverest tricks by directors Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio is playing some of Brooks\u2019 stories \u2014 like a memorable lunch with Cary Grant \u2014 across not just his sit-down interviews with them, but over multiple talk show appearances. He\u2019s been telling some of these jokes for decades. It doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re still good.",
      "\u201cThe 99 Year Old Man\u201d takes the whole life in: the formative childhood in Brooklyn; the Sid Caesar-aided entry to \u201cYour Show of Shows\u201d; the lifelong friendship with Carl Reiner; the 2000 Year Old Man sketches; \u201cThe Producers\u201d; the marriage to Anne Bancroft; \u201cBlazing Saddles,\u201d and beyond.",
      "But if there\u2019s an ongoing question in \u201cThe 99 Year Old Man,\u201d it\u2019s posed early by Apatow, who appears on-screen as Brooks\u2019 interviewer. Do people really know who he is? \u201cNo,\u201d Brooks answers straightaway.",
      "That might sound like an odd answer for someone who has so unabashedly lived nearly a century in the public eye. Yet Brooks has been such a non-stop performer that it can sometimes be difficult to see where the schtick ends and the self begins.",
      "One person describes Brooks, as a newborn, thinking the delivery doctor smacking him on the rear was applause. In an earlier clip, an interviewer laments Brooks\u2019 apparent lack of introspection. He replies that he\u2019s merely \u201ca coalescence of vapor.\u201d When Brooks gave his Oscar speech, for the screenplay to \u201cThe Producers,\u201d he said he would speak from the heart: \u201cBa-bum, ba-bum.\u201d",
      "So is what\u2019s inside Brooks just jokes? I\u2019d say \u2014 and I think this is what makes \u201cThe 99 Year Old Man\u201d not just an exhaustive documentary but a moving and even stirring one \u2014 it\u2019s more the opposite. Brooks\u2019 comedy, from the 2000 Year Old Man to \u201cHistory of the World, Part I,\u201d has always derived from something deeper, more personal and intrinsically Jewish than its slapstick qualities sometimes have suggested.",

      "You can see that in Brooks\u2019 decades of marriage with Bancroft, who describes, every time her husband came home as like a party. And you can see it in Brooks\u2019 undying friendship with Reiner. After the deaths of their wives, the two friends would nightly meet to eat deli sandwiches and watch old movies.

Soon his eclectic sound could be heard across films and television shows like \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u201d and HBO's \u201cInsecure.\u201d Since then, Duckwrth's music has gone against the grain, seamlessly blending elements of hip-hop, funk, rock and soul throughout his projects.",

      "If they win, the trophy will be awarded to immersive mix engineer Andrew Law, who formatted the album's previously mixed stereo recording for Dolby Atmos surround sound, a three-dimensional experience that allows listeners to feel as if they are at the center of the songs' layered instruments and melodies.",
      "\u201cThe difficult part is you have to keep the essence of the actual song so that when people listen to it on headphones or on other mediums, and not like in the (Dolby Atmos) studio, that it still sounds like the song without making it too crazy,\u201d said Law. \u201cI try to take the approach of keeping the song how it was meant to be heard. And then turn it into a big soundscape and something really, really fun when you\u2019re sitting in an Atmos studio.\u201d",

      "A detective must prove his innocence to an artificial intelligence judge in the new film \u201cMercy,\u201d starring Chris Pratt and Rebecca Ferguson",
      "It\u2019s a bold filmmaking choice to have a countdown clock on the screen for most of your movie.",
      "In the best-case scenario for a movie like \u201cMercy,\u201d in which a Los Angeles detective has prove his innocence to an artificial intelligence judge within said time limit, it heightens the tension. Who hasn\u2019t gotten sweaty palms in, say, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie when the bomb is ticking down and Tom Cruise still hasn\u2019t cleared the building? Why not just extend it for the duration?",
      "Perhaps in a better movie it might have worked. Sadly in \u201cMercy,\u201d in theaters Thursday, it\u2019s an ever-present reminder of just how much longer you must endure until you too are free of Chris Pratt, Rebecca Ferguson and that chair.",
      "In \u201cMercy\u2019s\u201d near-future Los Angeles, AI has been adopted by law enforcement and the judicial system to more efficiently clean up the city\u2019s crime and blight problem. It\u2019s a potent and not too far-flung idea that might have been a fascinating and provocative premise for a movie attempting to grapple with the implications of so-called progress that had the potential to be a worthy companion to another Cruise movie, \u201cMinority Report.\u201d But that would have required a more serious script than screenwriter Marco van Belle\u2019s and more vision than filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov managed to muster.",
      "When Pratt\u2019s character, Chris Raven, wakes up, barefoot and strapped into an electric chair sitting in the middle of an oddly large room that looks a bit like the holodeck, he\u2019s informed by an IMAX-sized AI judge (Ferguson) that he has 90 minutes to prove he didn\u2019t kill his wife (Annabelle Wallis). In this world, the incarcerated are guilty until proved innocent. They\u2019ve cut lawyers and juries out of the equation as well. Instead, the accused have everyone\u2019s digital footprint at their disposal to help build their own case. For Raven, that means everything from ring cam footage to his teenage daughter\u2019s secret Instagram account.",
      "Unfortunately for Raven, he woke up with some gaps in his memory between angrily busting into his home to confront his wife about something and being arrested and bludgeoned at a bar later that day. Raven was also one of the original champions of the AI judge system, which in a more curious script might have resulted in some real stakes. This story is more hung up on increasingly tortured plot contrivances, however, including Raven\u2019s drinking problem following the death of a partner killed on the job. To its credit, the story does really keep it ambiguous as to whether Raven did it or not, but to say that it earns any sort of investment in the outcome is a stretch.",

      "One of the most confounding choices is to have a real actor playing the AI judge. Wouldn\u2019t it have been more interesting and provocative to use an AI creation as the impartial Judge Maddox instead of stripping Ferguson of all emotion and charisma in the role? At times, it feels as tedious as watching a stranger\u2019s increasingly frustrating call with a robotic customer service representative play out in real time.",
      "For how reliant this movie is on screens and keeping Pratt alone, one might assume that \u201cMercy\u201d was a socially distanced, COVID-era leftover instead of something made in 2024. Kali Reis, playing another LAPD agent named Jaq who decides to help Raven investigate on the ground is the one that gets to be out in the real-world chasing leads and hunches. But for the most part, she\u2019s seen only through FaceTime and bodycam footage. Like Raven, we\u2019re largely stuck in the chair watching things play out on multiple screens, acutely aware of just how much time is left.",
      "\u201cMercy,\u201d an Amazon MGM release in theaters Thursday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cdrug content, bloody images, some strong language, teen smoking and violence.\u201d Running time: 101 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- In a dispute of operatic proportions, the production team of Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d at the Metropolitan Opera ordered their names stripped from programs over a restaging decision, and the company intends to bring back sets of a retired 2009 version.",
      "Director Carrie Cracknell\u2019s production opened on Dec. 31, 2023, in her Met debut, moving the action from early 19th century Seville, Spain, to a contemporary American industrial town. The character Escamillo is a rodeo star, not a bullfighter, in this staging.",
      "When the production opened, Escamillo entered in a red Jaguar convertible that crossed the stage as he started his famous Toreador\u2019s Song. He was accompanied by his entourage in three pickup trucks, all the vehicles moving on wires guided by a computer.",
      "In the restaging decision, the Jaguar and two trucks were eliminated. Escamillo walked in with his followers, some pushing a motorcycle. One of the pickup trucks from the original staging was kept, in a stationary position throughout the act.",
      "\u201cWe were furious,\u201d set designer Michael Levine said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my name attached to the production because it\u2019s not a representation of the original artistic intent. \u2026 I\u2019ve never come across anything on this level where they literally change the basic concept.\u201d",
      "Levine said the Met's assistant general manager for production notified him of the change last fall, just ahead of the Oct. 28 opening.",
      "\u201cI get a phone call from John Sellars saying: We\u2019re in terrible financial straits and we have to make cuts to the opera. We are going to cut the automation of the trucks,\u201d Levine said.",
      "Levine and Cracknell attempted to find a solution such as putting the cars on the stage turntable but said the Met wasn\u2019t willing to negotiate. Levine said his contract specified changes could not be made after opening night and he removed his name. Levine said the Met then gave the rest of the production team one day to decide whether they would follow suit.",
      "Cracknell, Tom Scutt (costumes), Guy Hoare (lighting), rocafilm/Roland Horvath (projections) and Ann Yee (choreography) also asked their names to be dropped. After the names of the conductor and chorus master, the only person listed in programs was revival stage director Melanie Bacaling, who was an assistant stage director when the production premiered, followed by several inches of white space.",
      "\u201cIt was really an economic decision,\u201d Met general manager Peter Gelb said of the change. \u201cWe decided it was incredibly expensive to run, and it was not particularly effective. We decided to cut it.\u201d",
      "Gelb said the savings was more than $300,000.",
      "On Tuesday, Gelb announced 22 layoffs to the Met's administrative staff of 284, 4-15% temporary salary cuts and the reduction next season by one opera to 17. The moves are projected to save $15 million this fiscal year and $25 million in 2026-27.",

      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization\u2019s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises.

      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans.

      "China's one-child policy led to harsh measures like forced abortions and sterilizations",
      "BEIJING -- China's one-child policy, one of the harshest attempts at population control the world has seen, forced abortions on women, made sterilization widespread and led to baby daughters being sold or even killed, because parents wanted their only child to be a male.",
      "Now, experts say, the question is whether it was all necessary. China's birth rate fell to record lows last year and its population has fallen for four years in a row, official statistics showed this week. Authorities, alarmed by the prospect of a shrinking workforce and an aging population, scrapped the policy in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to escape the fact that China demographically shot itself in the foot,\u201d said Mei Fong, the author of the 2016 book, \u201cOne Child: The Story of China\u2019s Most Radical Experiment.\u201d",

      "The then impoverished country wasn\u2019t the only one worried about having too many people at the time. Population control was a hot topic internationally and experts feared that rapid growth in China, India and elsewhere could overwhelm the earth\u2019s resources.",
      "The birth rate had begun to fall in the 1970s after the government began encouraging people to have fewer children. It's unclear how much its fall since then resulted from the one-child policy and to what degree it would have happened anyway because of the tremendous economic and societal changes over the last four decades.",
      "But the leadership at the time decided to curb population growth more directly, launching the one-child policy and enforcing it with stiff financial penalties for parents who had more than one child, as well as abortions and sterilization campaigns. It lasted for 35 years.",
      "Yi Fuxian, a senior scientist in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, notes that the number of people getting sterilized plunged from 1.4 million women and 180,000 men in 2014, two years before the policy was eased, to 190,000 women and 2,600 men in 2020.",

      "The world\u2019s first legally binding agreement to protect marine life in international waters takes effect Saturday",
      "The world\u2019s first legally binding agreement to protect marine life in international waters took effect Saturday, marking a historic moment for ocean conservation after nearly two decades of negotiations.",
      "The High Seas Treaty will govern nearly half the planet\u2019s surface \u2013 the vast ocean areas beyond any country\u2019s control. These waters face mounting threats from destructive fishing practices, shipping, plastic pollution, overfishing and potential deep sea mining, all compounded by climate change. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, making its health critical for addressing the climate crisis.",
      "The treaty entered into force 120 days after it reached the threshold of ratification by 60 countries in September. As of Friday, 83 countries had ratified it, including the recent addition of major maritime powers such as China and Japan.",
      "The treaty creates the first framework for establishing Marine Protected Areas on the high seas, which make up about two-thirds of the world\u2019s ocean. Currently, only around 1% of these international waters are protected.",
      "From Saturday, ratifying countries must begin working together on ocean science and technology as well as help developing nations build capacity to participate in ocean governance. Companies planning activities that could harm marine life must conduct environmental impact assessments that meet the treaty\u2019s standards. Those conducting research on ocean organisms that could be used commercially, such as for new medicines, must notify other countries and share their findings.",
      "Perhaps most significantly, countries must now promote the treaty\u2019s conservation goals when they participate in other international bodies that regulate ocean activities, such as regional fisheries organizations, the International Maritime Organization and the International Seabed Authority.",
      "While key institutions like the treaty\u2019s secretariat and scientific body are still being developed, countries can begin preparing proposals for Marine Protected Areas immediately. Potential sites include the Emperor Seamounts in the North Pacific, the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic and the Salas y Gomez and Nazca Ridges off South America.",
      "Conservationists warn governments must act quickly to achieve the global goal of protecting 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030 \u2013 a target scientists say is critical for ocean health. Because the high seas make up such a vast portion of the oceans, their protection is essential to reaching that goal.",
      "\u201cThe marine protected areas under the treaty will only be as strong as the governments make them,\u201d said Megan Randles, global political lead for Greenpeace\u2019s Ocean Campaign. \u201cWe can\u2019t trust big fishing industry players to simply stop fishing in these critical ecosystems. We need governments to use the treaty to force their hands.\u201d",
      "How those protected areas will actually be monitored and enforced is undecided. Countries are exploring various options, from satellite technology to coordinating patrols between multiple nations to using other UN agencies to help with oversight, said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance. Those details will be worked out as the first protected areas take shape.",
      "Within a year, the treaty\u2019s first Conference of Parties will meet to decide key operational details, from budgets to the makeup of various committees. Countries have been working through many of those questions at preparatory meetings, with a final session scheduled for late March. The earliest any Marine Protected Areas could actually win approval would be at the second COP, since the scientific body that will review proposals hasn\u2019t yet been established.",

      "A nonprofit organization in the United Kingdom has attracted thousands of members by encouraging residents to \u201cget fit by doing good.\u201d",
      "LONDON -- Shoveling piles of compost and clearing weeds on a cold, damp evening in London might not be most people\u2019s idea of fun.",
      "But it\u2019s smiles and chatter all around as a group of people in running gear put on headlamps and get to work in a community garden located on a derelict parking lot rooftop. The volunteers warmed up by jogging a mile to get to the site, and the digging, squatting and lifting they are doing is part of a weekly workout session.",
      "Combining exercise with community service is the mission of GoodGym, an organization that encourages U.K. residents to \u201cget fit by doing good.\u201d There\u2019s no expensive gym membership, treadmills or weights. All participants need is a desire to walk, run or bike and a willingness to sort cans at a food bank, pick up trash, visit an older adult or do other kinds of local volunteer work.",
      "\u201cI go to the normal gym usually and I do other sorts of exercise, but this is my mandatory once-a-week run with the GoodGym group,\u201d said Jason Kurtis, 42, who was among the regulars toiling in the south London garden. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun and it forces me to get out, especially on a Monday night when it\u2019s cold and in the middle of winter.\u201d",
      "GoodGym says it has more than 26,600 members in 67 locations across England and Wales, and that it wants to start new groups in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Most weeks there are meetups happening somewhere. Recent workouts in London included clearing sidewalks of discarded Christmas trees, picking plastic litter from the muddy banks of the River Thames, planting fruit trees and setting up cots for homeless people.",
      "Members say that signing up for activities \u2014 and feeling they\u2019re a part of something positive \u2014 motivates them to exercise regularly.",
      "GoodGym began in 2007 when its founder, Ivo Gormley, started running to deliver a newspaper to an older person in his neighborhood. At the time, Gormley said he wasn\u2019t doing any exercise and missed being part of a basketball team.",
      "\u201cI just didn\u2019t like that idea of going to a gym, going into a sweaty basement and lifting things that don\u2019t really need lifting. I thought I could do something more useful in my exercise,\u201d he said.",
      "He started organizing group runs to places where participants could help with community projects big and small: the first group ripped down outdated posters in his east London neighborhood, Gormley said.",
      "The idea gained traction in other English cities and GoodGym, which registered as a charity in 2015, expanded rapidly. The COVID-19 pandemic ruled out group runs, but the organization received a surge in requests to help older adults who were isolated at home. Volunteers started focusing on tasks like delivering prescriptions and food.",
      "GoodGym still pairs volunteers with retirees who want someone to talk to or need help with practical tasks like moving heavy furniture or lawn mowing. Many home visits call for one volunteer at a time and therefore have no group exercise component, though participants are encouraged to run, walk or cycle to their assignments.",
      "Gormley said he wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to stay in shape and give back. Monthly donations are welcome but voluntary, and members are not pressured to show up, he said.",
      "\u201cYou can just sign up today and have a go tonight. We try to reduce the barriers as much as possible,\u201d Gormley said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to come back if you don\u2019t like it. It\u2019s a really easy way to get involved.\u201d",

      "Hancock organizes a variety of volunteer projects for GoodGym members in her area, but helping to maintain the garden is one her group returns to every month. She recalls how they once helped shift hundreds of bags of heavy compost up narrow steps to reach the rooftop.",
      "\u201cThat was an amazing workout,\u201d she said.",
      "Hancock said she hardly ever cancels a scheduled run and activity, and members keep coming even during London's bleak, drizzly winters. For women, the regular sessions have the added benefit of offering a safe way to run outside after dark, she said.",
      "\u201cI really love coming. I think it\u2019s just a boost of positivity in the week,\u201d said Sophie Humphrey, 33. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to get together a group of people who just want to help somebody they don\u2019t know.\"",
      "Gormley said he doesn\u2019t know of many similar organizations that combine fitness with volunteering, though he acknowledges that to some extent, the idea behind GoodGym is \u201creally obvious.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what people have always done, right? You grow some food and literally through the action of planting and digging, that\u2019s where your exercise comes from,\u201d he said.",
      "The opportunity to socialize is a key element that hooks participants, Gormley said. He said a recent member survey indicated that many young people were keen to get away from phone screens and to have more in-person interactions. Members of Hancock's group Monday night group sometimes go to a pub together when their volunteer work is done.",
      "Christian Krekel, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics who does research in behavioral economics and wellbeing, spent two years leading an evaluation of GoodGym to determine if blending volunteering with exercise offered additional mental health benefits. The findings, based on survey results from 3,600 people who had either expressed interest in joining or already were active members, were promising, he said.",
      "A team of economists recorded improvements in all six aspects of mental wellbeing they measured, with participants reporting feeling less lonely and more satisfied with their lives, as well as a greater sense of \u201cbelongingness and connectedness,\u201d Krekel said. More research is needed, but the team hopes the findings, if they are validated, could help shape public policies on mental health.",
      "\u201cBecause of this unique combination of volunteering or pro-social activity and physical activity, we do find stronger well-being impacts than what the literature suggests for volunteering and for physical activity alone,\u201d Krekel said. \u201cSo I think that\u2019s what makes this so unique, and it\u2019s actually quite powerful.\u201d",

      "Jared Kushner envisions a rebuilt Gaza with high-rises, a coastline that attracts tourists and a bustling port",
      "JERUSALEM -- Modern cities with sleek high-rises, a pristine coastline that attracts tourists and a state-of-the-art port that jut into the Mediterranean. This is what Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump's son-in-law and Middle East adviser, says Gaza could become, according to a presentation he gave at an economic forum in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "In his 10-minute speech on Thursday, Kushner claimed it would be possible \u2014 if there's security \u2014 to quickly rebuild Gaza's cities, which are now in ruins after more than two years of war between Israel and Hamas.",
      "\u201cIn the Middle East, they build cities like this ... in three years,\" said Kushner, who helped broker the ceasefire in place since October. \u201cAnd so stuff like this is very doable, if we make it happen.\u201d",
      "That timeline is at odds with what the United Nations and Palestinians expect will be a very long process to rehabilitate Gaza. Across the territory of roughly 2 million people, former apartment blocks are hills of rubble, unexploded ordnance lurks beneath the wreckage, disease spreads because of sewage-tainted water and city streets look like dirt canyons.",
      "The United Nations Office for Project Services says Gaza has more than 60 million tons of rubble, enough to fill nearly 3,000 container ships. That will take over seven years to clear, they say, and then additional time is needed for demining.",
      "Kushner spoke as Trump and an assortment of world leaders gathered to ratify the charter of the Board of Peace, the body that will oversee the ceasefire and reconstruction process.",
      "Here are key takeaways from the presentation, and some questions raised by it:",
      "Kushner said his reconstruction plan would only work if Gaza has \u201csecurity\u201d \u2014 a big \u201cif.\u201d",
      "It remains uncertain whether Hamas will disarm, and Israeli troops fire upon Palestinians in Gaza on a near-daily basis.",
      "Officials from the militant group say they have the right to resist Israeli occupation. But they have said they would consider \u201cfreezing\u201d their weapons as part of a process to achieve Palestinian statehood.",
      "Since the latest ceasefire took effect Oct. 10, Israeli troops have killed at least 470 Palestinians in Gaza, including young children and women, according to the territory's Health Ministry. Israel says it has opened fire in response to violations of the ceasefire, but dozens of civilians have been among the dead.",
      "In the face of these challenges, the Board of Peace has been working with Israel on \u201cde-escalation,\u201d Kushner said, and is turning its attention to the demilitarization of Hamas \u2014 a process that would be managed by the U.S.-backed Palestinian committee overseeing Gaza.",
      "It's far from certain that Hamas will yield to the committee, which goes by the acronym NCAG and is envisioned eventually handing over control of Gaza to a reformed Palestinian Authority. Hamas says it will dissolve the government to make way, but has been vague about what will happen to its forces or weapons. Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 from the Palestinian Authority.",
      "Another factor that could complicate disarmament: the existence of competing armed groups in Gaza, which Kushner's presentation said would either be dismantled or \u201cintegrated into NCAG.\u201d During the war, Israel has supported armed groups and gangs of Palestinians in Gaza in what it says is a move to counter Hamas.",
      "Without security, Kushner said, there would be no way to draw investors to Gaza and or stimulate job growth. The latest joint estimate from the U.N., the European Union and the World Bank is that rebuilding Gaza will cost $70 billion.",
      "Reconstruction would not begin in areas that are not fully disarmed, one of Kushner\u2019s slides said.",

      "When unveiling his plan for Gaza's reconstruction, Kushner did not say how demining would be handled or where Gaza\u2019s residents would live as their areas are being rebuilt. At the moment, most families are sheltering in a stretch of land that includes parts of Gaza City and most of Gaza's coastline.",
      "In Kushner's vision of a future Gaza, there would be new roads and a new airport \u2014 the old one was destroyed by Israel more than 20 years ago \u2014 plus a new port, and an area along the coastline designated for \u201ctourism\u201d that is currently where most Palestinians live. The plan calls for eight \u201cresidential areas\u201d interspersed with parks, agricultural land and sports facilities.",
      "Also highlighted by Kushner were areas for \u201cadvanced manufacturing,\u201d \u201cdata centers,\u201d and an \u201cindustrial complex,\u201d though it is not clear what industries they would support.",
      "Kushner said construction would first focus on building \u201cworkforce housing\u201d in Rafah, a southern city that was decimated during the war and is currently controlled by Israeli troops. He said rubble-clearing and demolition were already underway there.",
      "Kushner did not address whether demining would occur. The United Nations says unexploded shells and missiles are everywhere in Gaza, posing a threat to people searching through rubble to find their relatives, belongings, and kindling.",
      "Rights groups say rubble clearance and demining activities have not begun in earnest in the zone where most Palestinians live because Israel has prevented the entry of heavy machinery.",
      "After Rafah will come the reconstruction of Gaza City, Kushner said, or \u201cNew Gaza,\u201d as his slide calls it. The new city could be a place where people will \u201chave great employment,\" he said.",
      "Nomi Bar-Yaacov, an international lawyer and expert in conflict resolution, described the board\u2019s initial concept for redeveloping Gaza as \u201ctotally unrealistic\u201d and an indication Trump views it from a real estate developer's perspective, not a peacemaker's.",
      "A project with so many high-rise buildings would never be acceptable to Israel because each would provide a clear view of its military bases near the border, said Bar-Yaacov, who is an associate fellow at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.",
      "What's more, Kushner\u2019s presentation said the NCAG would eventually hand off oversight of Gaza to the Palestinian Authority after it makes reforms. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has adamantly opposed any proposal for postwar Gaza that involves the Palestinian Authority. And even in the West Bank, where it governs, the Palestinian Authority is widely unpopular because of corruption and perceived collaboration with Israel.",

      "QUITO, Ecuador -- Deep in the Ecuadorian Andes, an ancient forest stands as a final sanctuary against the encroachment of human activity. This is the Yanacocha Reserve, the last refuge for the Black-breasted puffleg (Eriocnemis nigrivestis), a tiny hummingbird teetering on the edge of extinction.",
      "Measuring just 9 centimeters (3.5 inches), this emblematic bird of Quito is one of the most threatened species on the planet. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, its global population has dwindled to between 150 and 200 birds.",
      "Founded 25 years ago by the Jocotoco Foundation, the Yanacocha Reserve has become a centerpiece for Andean biodiversity.",
      "\u201cWe realized we were conserving an entire ecosystem, not just one species,\u201d conservationist Paola Villalba told The Associated Press.",
      "The bird is easily identified by the striking white \u201ctrousers\u201d of feathers around its legs, which contrast sharply with its deep, metallic black chest and bronze-green wings. Despite its beauty, its survival is at risk as high-altitude forests are cleared for grazing and agriculture.",
      "Shirley Farinango, of the Birds and Conservation Foundation, notes that the pressure is most intense because the puffleg occupies a narrow ecological niche between 3,000 and 3,500 meters (9,800 and 11,400 feet) above sea level.

      "WASHINGTON -- The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on a fleet of nine ships and their owners accused of transporting hundreds of millions of dollars in forbidden Iranian oil to foreign markets.",
      "The sanctions are being imposed because of Iran\u2019s \u201cshutdown of internet access to conceal its abuses\" against its citizens during its crackdown on nationwide protests, the U.S. Treasury Department said. They \u201ctarget a critical component of how Iran generates the funds used to repress its own people,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said.",
      "Iranians and Iranian businesses have been struggling under the longest and most comprehensive internet shutdown in the history of the Islamic Republic. The government blocked internet access on Jan. 8 as nationwide protests led to a crackdown on information sharing.",
      "The Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control said the nine targeted vessels \u2014 flagged from Palau, Panama and other jurisdictions \u2014 are part of a shadow fleet, a network of older tankers used to transport goods that are subject to international sanctions, notably from Russia and Iran. The U.S. sanctions aim to prevent the targeted Iranians from doing business with Americans or accessing U.S. accounts.",
      "Friday's action is part of an ongoing buildup of tensions between the U.S. and the theocratic nation as an American aircraft carrier group inches closer to the Middle East. President Donald Trump called the group an \u201carmada\u201d in comments to journalists aboard Air Force One late Thursday.",
      "Trump added that the U.S. was moving the ships toward Iran \u201cjust in case\u201d he wants to take action against Iran's government. The Republican president has repeatedly boasted that his threats on Iran have prevented the execution of more than 800 dissidents.",

      "The decision came at the conclusion of the National Party Congress, the country\u2019s most important political conclave.",
      "No announcement was made about whether he will also become president. If To Lam were to get both positions, he would be the country\u2019s most powerful leader in decades, in a manner similar to that of Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "The Congress was framed by Vietnam\u2019s defining national question: whether the country can transform itself into a high-income economy by 2045. During the meeting, Vietnam set a target of average annual GDP growth of 10% or more from 2026 to 2030.",
      "The gathering brought together nearly 1,600 delegates to define Vietnam's political and economic direction through 2031. It also confirmed a slate of senior appointments, electing 19 members to the Politburo, the country\u2019s top leadership body.",
      "Beyond settling the question of who will lead Vietnam through 2031, the Congress will also determine how the country\u2019s single-party system responds to world grown increasingly turbulent as China and the United States wrangle over trade and Washington under President Donald Trump challenges a longstanding global order.",

      "Lam has overseen Vietnam's most ambitious bureaucratic and economic reforms since the late 1980s, when it liberalized its economy. Under his leadership, the government has cut tens of thousands of public-sector jobs, redrawn administrative boundaries to speed decision-making, and initiated dozens of major infrastructure projects.",
      "Lam spent decades in the Ministry of Public Security before becoming its minister in 2016. He led an anti-corruption campaign championed by his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong. During his rise, Vietnam\u2019s Politburo lost six of its 18 members during an anti-graft campaign, including two former presidents and Vietnam\u2019s parliamentary head.",

      "Avery has dealt with disasters before. Nearly every one of his 14,000 customers lost power when the remnants of Hurricane Helene tore through in 2024.",

      "Officials across the eastern two-thirds of the U.S. have been sounding the alarm about the potential for freezing rain to wreak havoc on power systems. In the South, especially, losing electricity doesn\u2019t just mean the lights going out. It means losing heat.",

      "The governor added, though, that residents could lose power as ice weighs down power lines and trees fall onto them. But, he said, energy providers are prepositioned to fix any outages, and there\u2019s been an effort to clear trees and branches near power lines in recent years.",
      "Winter Storm Uri also exposed disparities in how outages affected communities, said Jennifer Laird, a sociology professor at the City University of New York\u2019s Lehman College who studies energy insecurity. Researchers have found that residents in predominantly Hispanic areas experienced more outages, while Black residents were more likely to face outages lasting a day or more.",
      "Laird said outages expose vulnerabilities people don\u2019t anticipate, from medical equipment that requires electricity to families with infants who rely on refrigeration for breast milk. Younger households and those with lower levels of education, in particular, are less likely to have contingency plans in place, she said.",

About 1 in 6 U.S. households are already behind on their energy bills, and with millions expected to turn up their heaters during the cold snap, that number could rise, Laird said.",
      "\u201cA month or two after the storm hits, suddenly the bill hits,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could see a rise in disconnection notices and disconnections.\u201d",
      "Utilities in the Southeast have also warned customers to prepare for possible outages. Duke Energy, which serves more than 4.6 million customers in North and South Carolina, urged residents to be ready for multiple days without power.

      "TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi dissolved the lower house of parliament on Friday, paving the way for an early election on Feb. 8.",
      "The move is an attempt to capitalize on her popularity to help the governing party regain ground after major losses in recent years, but it will delay parliamentary approval for a budget that aims at boosting a struggling economy and addressing soaring prices.",
      "Takaichi, elected in October as Japan\u2019s first female leader, has been in office only three months, but she has seen strong approval ratings of about 70%.",
      "Takaichi\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party could still face some challenges as it reels from a series of scandals about corruption and the party's past ties to the Unification Church. But it's not clear if the new opposition Centrist Reform Alliance can attract moderate voters, while opposition parties are still too splintered to a pose a serious threat to the LDP.",
      "Takaichi is also seeing rising animosity with China, since making remarks on Taiwan. And U.S. President Donald Trump wants her to spend more on weapons, as Washington and Beijing pursue military superiority in the region.",
      "The dissolution of the 465-member lower House of Representatives paves the way for a 12-day campaign that officially starts Tuesday. When Speaker Fukushiro Nukaga declared the dissolution, lawmakers stood up, shouted banzai \u2014 \u201clong live\u201d \u2014 three times and rushed out to prepare for the campaign.",
      "Takaichi\u2019s plan for an early election aims to capitalize on her popularity to win a governing majority in the lower House, the more powerful of Japan\u2019s two-chamber parliament called the National Diet.",
      "The scandal-tainted LDP and its coalition had a slim majority in the lower House after an election loss in 2024. The coalition lacks a majority in the upper House of Councillors and relies on winning votes from opposition members to pass its agenda.",
      "Opposition leaders criticized Takaichi for delaying passage of a budget needed to fund key economic measures.",
      "\u201cI believe that the only option is for the people, as sovereign citizens, to decide whether Sanae Takaichi should be prime minister,\u201d she told a news conference Monday when announcing plans for the election. \u201cI\u2019m staking my career as prime minister\u201d on it.",
      "Takaichi, a hard-line conservative, wants to highlight differences with her centrist predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba.",
      "Takaichi stresses that voters need to judge her fiscal spending moves, further military buildup and tougher immigration policies to make Japan \u201cstrong and prosperous.\u201d",
      "While an upbeat and decisive image has earned her strong approval ratings and fans of her personal style, the LDP isn't popular as it recovers from a political funds scandal. Many traditional LDP voters have shifted to emerging far-right populist opposition parties, such as the anti-globalist Sanseito.",

      "Takaichi struck a deal with the JIP after the LDP\u2019s longtime ally Komeito, a Buddhist-backed centrist party, left the governing bloc over her ideological views and reluctance to pursue anti-corruption measures. With the new partner\u2019s help, she secured just enough votes to become prime minister.",

      "Activists report that Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests has killed at least 5,002 people",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The toll in Iran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests has reached at least 5,002 people killed, activists said Friday, warning many more were feared dead as the most comprehensive internet blackout in the country's history crossed the two-week mark.",
      "The challenge in getting information out of Iran persists due to authorities cutting off access to the internet on Jan. 8, even as tensions rise between the United States and Iran as an American aircraft carrier group moves closer to the Middle East \u2014 a force U.S. President Donald Trump likened to an \u201carmada\u201d in comments to journalists late Thursday.",
      "The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency offered the death toll, saying 4,716 were demonstrators, 203 were government-affiliated, 43 were children and 40 were civilians not taking part in the protests. It added that more than 26,800 people had been detained in a widening arrest campaign by authorities.",
      "The group's figures have been accurate in previous unrest in Iran and rely on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths. That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Iran\u2019s government offered its first death toll Wednesday, saying 3,117 people were killed. It added that 2,427 of the dead in the demonstrations that began Dec. 28 were civilians and security forces, with the rest being \u201cterrorists.\u201d Iran\u2019s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",
      "The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, in part due to authorities cutting access to the internet and blocking international calls into the country. Iran also reportedly has limited journalists\u2019 ability locally to report on the aftermath, instead repeatedly airing claims on state television that refer to demonstrators as \u201crioters\u201d motivated by America and Israel, without offering evidence to support the allegation.",
      "The new toll comes as tensions remain high over Trump laying down two red lines over the protests \u2014 the killing of peaceful demonstrators and Tehran conducting mass executions. Iran\u2019s attorney general and others have called some of those being held \u201cmohareb\u201d \u2014 or \u201cenemies of God.\u201d That charge carries the death penalty. It had been used along with others to carry out mass executions in 1988 that reportedly killed at least 5,000 people.",
      "The U.S. military meanwhile has moved more military assets toward the Mideast, including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and associated warships traveling with it from the South China Sea.",
      "A U.S. Navy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military movements, said Thursday that the Lincoln strike group is currently in the Indian Ocean.",

    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court for the past year has repeatedly allowed President Donald Trump to fire heads of independent agencies, but it appears to be drawing a line with the Federal Reserve.",
      "The court has signaled for months that it sees the Fed in a different light. It has said that the president can fire directors of other agencies for any reason, but can remove Fed governors only \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is often interpreted to mean neglect of duty or malfeasance.",
      "Last year, the court allowed President Donald Trump to fire \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, but it carved out a distinction for the Fed. The two officials had argued that if Trump could fire them, he could also fire members of the Fed\u2019s board of governors.",
      "\u201cWe disagree,\u201d the court said then. \u201cThe Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\u201d",
      "That is now being put to the test in a case in front of the Supreme Court involving Trump's attempt to remove Fed governor Lisa Cook. On Wednesday during oral arguments, the court seemed inclined to keep Cook in her job.",
      "Allowing Cook\u2019s firing to go forward \u201cwould weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\u201d said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three Trump appointees on the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "But the court largely skirted a key issue: What, exactly, is the legal principle that protects the Fed, but not the other agencies?",
      "Several legal experts say the justices are on shaky ground. The Fed, they argue, is similar in many ways to the Federal Trade Commission or the National Labor Relations Board, agencies Congress intended to be independent but whose officials Trump has been able to fire without pushback from the high court.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no historical grounds for distinguishing the Fed from other independent agencies that Congress has designed,\u201d said Jane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University. \u201cThe whole argument was premised on the idea that the Fed is different. They haven\u2019t explained exactly why.\u201d",
      "Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of financial regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, added, \u201cI\u2019ll say as a legal scholar and as a historian I think that differentiation is hocus pocus.\u201d",
      "Just last month, the court signaled in a separate oral argument that it would likely allow Trump to fire FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter. The conservative majority on the court also suggested it would overturn a 90-year-old precedent that sharply limited the president's ability to fire top officials at independent agencies.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts and many of his colleagues support the \u201cunitary executive\" theory, which holds that the president should have full sway over the staffing of agencies in the executive branch.",
      "Agency directors, like Slaughter, \u201care exercising massive power over individual liberty and billion-dollar industries\u201d without being accountable to anyone, Kavanaugh said at the December oral argument.",
      "With the Federal Reserve, however, the Supreme Court's conservative justices have applied a different view: that the Fed\u2019s monetary policy \u2014 the setting of short-term interest rates and management of the money supply \u2014 historically hasn\u2019t been overseen by the executive branch.",

      "Some legal experts have likewise drawn a distinction between the Fed and other independent agencies. In a brief filed in the Cook case, Aaron Nielson, a law professor at the University of Texas, and formerly a top lawyer in Texas government, wrote that, \u201cWhereas the modern FTC indisputably exercises executive power, the Fed's core function is monetary policy, which need not and often does not require executive power.\"",
      "The First and Second Banks of the United States were nationwide banks that were the closest the United States had to a central bank in the first few decades after the nation's founding, and both \u201cconducted early monetary policy,\" Nielson wrote, but weren't executive branch agencies.",
      "But Lev Menand, a law professor at Columbia University and author of a book about the Fed, argued that the Fed does exercise executive power when it regulates the banking system. And monetary policy, when it adjusts the money supply, is part of that regulation, he said.",
      "There are also only three types of government authority, Menand argues: legislative, executive, and judicial, and the Fed belongs in the executive category.",
      "\u201cThere is no fourth type of government power,\u201d Menand said. \"There is no other place to locate the Fed.\u201d",
      "Still, the justices mostly avoided addressing why the Fed is different during Wednesday's oral argument, in part, Menand noted, because neither side pushed it. Cook's lawyers had no reason to question a distinction that appeared to favor them.",
      "And even the government's own top Supreme Court lawyer, D. John Sauer, acknowledged that Trump could only fire Cook \u201cfor cause,\u201d while in the other cases the White House had sought to remove officials for any reason, including policy differences. The distinction made it harder for the White House to argue that Cook should immediately be removed from office.",
      "\u201cThere is a long tradition of having this exercise of monetary policy be exercised independent of executive influence,\" Sauer said. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t dispute that that\u2019s what Congress was doing.\u201d",
      "Paul Clement, one of Cook's lawyers, told the justices, \u201cit\u2019s kind of why this case is, I think, problematic for the government because they could have come in here and said, you know, Fed, schmed, it\u2019s not that different. This is just like the FTC.\u201d",
      "Instead, Clement added, \u201cthey come in and say, no, we\u2019re going to accept that the Fed is different, at least for purposes of this case.\"",
      "The Supreme Court will initially rule on the narrow question of whether Cook can remain in her position while the larger dispute over her firing is fought in the lower courts. Still, at some point it may have to issue more comprehensive rulings that could include a fuller explanation of why the justices see the Fed as different.",
      "For now, the Fed's size and impact on the financial markets may be offering it a measure of protection.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t mean to denigrate any other agency, but there\u2019s a reason that monetary policy has been treated differently, for lo these many years,\u201d Clement said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a reason that the markets watch the Fed a little more closely than they watch really any other agency of government.\u201d",

      "Many brands stopped shipping their goods weeks ago as Saks Global's financial distress became more evident and bankruptcy appeared inevitable, experts said. A visit to Saks Fifth Avenue's flagship store in Manhattan last week revealed noticeable merchandise gaps, including handbags and shoes spread out along shelves.",
      "Neil Saunders of GlobalData Retail, a research firm, noted it's critical for Saks to have a good assortment including trendy items from small niche brands.",
      "\u201cIf Saks or Neiman Marcus are not offering that, those customers will find somewhere else to shop,\" he said.",
      "The bankruptcy occurred a little over a year after the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue agreed to buy the Neiman Marcus Group, its upscale rival, for $2.65 billion. Amazon took a minority stake in the deal, which saddled the new holding company with significant debt at a time of rising competition and a slowdown in luxury spending.",
      "Here's a look at some ripple effects from the bankruptcy filing, including the retailers who potentially could stand to benefit:",
      "Major brands like Chanel and Kering \u2014 the parent of Gucci and Saint Laurent, among others\u2014 top the list of creditors owed the most money. But bankruptcy lawyers and industry executives expect that luxury conglomerates will be fine.",
      "The big worry: the small and medium-size brands that have already been squeezed financially by Saks. Some could shutter their businesses if bills are left unpaid.",
      "\u201cThis is very painful,\" said Joseph Sarachek, a lawyer who represents roughly 30 brands owed money by Saks. \u201dA lot of these guys are going to go out of business.\u201d",
      "Sarachek declined to name his clients for fear of retribution by Saks but said that they're owed anywhere from $600,000 to $10 million. He said his clients don't operate their own stores, and for some, Saks had been their only big retail account.",
      "He said he has recommended to his clients not to ship to Saks unless they get more clarity on payment terms.",
      "Even before the merger with Neiman Marcus, suppliers were grappling with skipped payments from Saks, creating anger and mistrust.",
      "Over the past year, that relationship only worsened, with management changing the payment terms for brands that supplied the stores, according to Gary Wassner, CEO of Hildun Corp. which provides credit guarantees to roughly 120 brands that sell to Saks.",
      "For some, Saks Global accounted for 40% to 50% of their business, he said.",
      "Wassner advised his clients not to ship to Saks starting in Dec. 19. He said Wednesday he's hoping to approve shipping next week once agreeable payment terms are negotiated.",

    "story": [
      "Venezuela\u2019s legislature is debating a major overhaul of its oil sector, the first since Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's era",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuela\u2019s legislature advanced a bill on Thursday to loosen state control over the country's vast oil sector in the first major overhaul since the late socialist leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez nationalized parts of the industry in 2007.",
      "The legislation would formally break decades of state command over some of the world's largest oil reserves, create new opportunities for private companies to invest and establish international arbitration for investment disputes.",
      "Following the U.S. capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro earlier this month, the Trump administration has ramped up pressure on acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez and other allies of the ousted leader to invite greater investment from U.S. energy companies in Venezuela\u2019s flagging oil industry.",
      "A draft of the proposed legislation, a copy of which was seen by The Associated Press, represents a stark retreat from the resource nationalism at the heart of Venezuela's socialist-inspired revolution.",
      "Reflecting U.S. demands, the proposed legislation would allow private companies to independently operate oil fields, market their own crude output and collect the cash revenues through contracts with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, the state-run oil company and long the cornerstone of Venezuela\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cThe operating company shall assume the comprehensive management of the execution of the activities, at its sole cost, expense and risk,\u201d the draft says, adding that portions of production volumes \u201cmay be directly commercialized by the operating company, once governmental obligations have been fulfilled.\u201d",
      "Crucially, the bill offers companies the option of settling legal disputes through arbitration in international courts rather than just local courts. It also allows the government to cut royalties from the current 30% to as low as 15% and slash extraction taxes to persuade companies to commit to difficult projects in underdeveloped fields.",
      "The president of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, told lawmakers at the start of Thursday\u2019s debate that the bill aims to \u201callow an accelerated increase in production\u201d of oil in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cOil under the ground is useless,\u201d he said, referring to the need to boost oil production and open up exploration opportunities.",
      "Pushed by Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, the bill is expected to advance swiftly through the ruling party-dominated legislature.",
      "After around two hours of discussion, lawmakers gave initial approval to the bill on Thursday and sent it to a second round of debate, yet to be scheduled.",
      "During the session, Orlando Camacho, a lawmaker and head of Venezuela\u2019s national Fedeindustria business association, said the bill ensures \u201cthat oil continues to be the driving force of our country\u2019s development.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge ticked up in November in the latest sign that prices remain stubbornly elevated, while consumers spent at a healthy pace.",
      "Consumer prices rose 2.8% in November from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said Thursday, up from a 2.7% annual pace in October. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices also increased 2.8% in November from a year ago, slightly higher than October\u2019s 2.7%.",
      "Consumer spending climbed 0.5% in November from the previous month, the report also showed, a solid increase that hits at an economy growing at a healthy pace in the final three months of last year.",
      "The figures point to a mostly strong economy with inflation still elevated, but down sharply from a four-decade peak in June 2022. Hiring has slowed to a crawl, however, leaving job-seekers frustrated even as the unemployment rate stays low. Thursday's figures suggest that the Federal Reserve will be less likely to reduce its key interest rate when it meets next week, a tact typically used if it is worried about a stumbling economy.",

      "\u201cToday\u2019s data should reassure the Fed that the economy remains on a solid footing, despite a cooler labor market,\u201d said James McCann, an economist at Edward Jones. \"Indeed, there looks to be little urgency to cut rates at next week\u2019s meeting, and the central bank could stay on hold for longer should growth remain robust into 2026 and inflation continue to run at above target rates.\u201d",
      "On a monthly basis prices, were milder: Both overall inflation and core inflation moved up just 0.2% in November from October. At that pace, over time inflation would move closer to the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%. Thursday\u2019s data was delayed by the six-week government shutdown last fall.",
      "The solid figures on consumer spending follow a separate report Thursday which showed that the economy expanded at a healthy 4.4% annual rate in the July-September quarter, the fastest growth in two years. Thursday's data points to continued solid growth in the final quarter of 2025.",

      "It's easy to dash to the closest hardware store to grab a bag of salt, but experts say there are a lot of environmental and other factors to consider when tackling all that ice and snow.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Rock salt, also known as sodium chloride, is the cheapest and most commonly used product. But it's not great for the environment and it's not the most effective option out there.",
      "\"There's a chart we reference that\u2019s chemical effectiveness at certain temperatures. And really, when you get to about 15 degrees or colder, you can keep applying more and more rock salt and it\u2019s not going to do any more than it already does,\u201d said Martin Tirado, CEO of the Snow and Ice Management Association, a trade group for industry professionals.",
      "In those conditions, other products \u2014 calcium chloride, magnesium chloride \u2014 release heat that helps the salt work better, Tirado said.",
      "The different formulations vary in other ways, too, including how quickly they work, their corrosiveness and how they interact with moisture. Calcium chloride and magnesium chloride can cost at least twice as much as rock salt.",
      "But all contain chlorides that can pollute fresh water, damage shrubs, trees and grass and crumble concrete sidewalks, stoops and driveways.",
      "Blends and coatings can reduce the corrosive nature and environmental hazards of these salts, experts say.",
      "Calcium manganese acetate is one of the tamest de-icing products out there, developed specifically to replace rock salt and be more environmentally friendly. It is biodegradable, a corrosion inhibitor, and typically used as a liquid. But it is much more expensive and can still create issues with dissolved oxygen on bodies of water.",
      "Pamela Bennett, a horticulture professor at Ohio State, said rock salt is the worst for plants. It gets them in two ways: through the roots and through the air.",
      "Salt percolates through the soil. When plants start to draw in salty water in the spring, that dries roots, leading to dry leaves. Brown tips on leaves indicate the soil might have gotten too salty.",
      "Salt can also reach plant foliage \u2014 in the winter, that's evergreens \u2014 directly when it's carried by mist and spray. That's an issue that's worse on major roads as a lot of traffic moves quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a lot of road salt on the highways, cars are splashing and wind blows it. That salt turns into what looks like a burn,\u201d Bennett says.",
      "Most people walking their dog in snowy places have seen what happens when they walk across a heavy salt treatment \u2014 stopping suddenly and lifting a paw as if in pain.",
      "\u201cTheir paw pads get dry or they get little cuts because those crystals are sharp, and then they\u2019re chewing them because that\u2019s the only way they know to make it feel better,\u201d said Alison Manchester, an assistant clinical sciences professor at Cornell University. If they swallow enough salt, it can lead to vomiting, too.",

      "Sand can also accumulate in your soil, eventually becoming a problem for plant growth. It can even make a type of concrete when it mixes in clay-heavy soils, experts say.",
      "Unconventional solutions are out there. You can buy a de-icer that wraps its chlorides in beet juice or beet extract that coats the granules for a variety of benefits, including melting ice faster, working in colder temperatures and staying where it's put. And a Korean company, Star's Tech, is working with material taken from invasive starfish to produce a de-icer that it says more slowly releases chloride material and thus avoids some of the corrosion and environmental problems of salt.",
      "Experts say preparation and strategy can make clearing ice easier. That starts with watching forecasts to see how much snow is expected.",
      "\u201cPeople wait until after the storm to start shoveling,\" Tirado said. \"That\u2019s fine if you\u2019re having 1 to 2 inches. If you start getting 3, 4 or more inches than that, you can\u2019t wait ... you need to go out multiple times.

It \u201cmakes me feel as if my private life had been violated by violent intruders \u2014 that there had been sinister thieves in my home all along and that I had been living with them completely unaware.\u201d",
      "Hurley testified the day after Prince Harry choked up as he spoke of the emotional toll his battle against the British media had taken on him and his family. Harry showed up in the High Court on Thursday to show his support during much of Hurley's testimony.",
      "Harry, Hurley and Elton John are among a group of seven claimants who allege that Associated Newspapers Ltd. hired private investigators to unlawfully snoop on them over two decades.",
      "The publisher denies the claims and has called them preposterous. It said that the articles were reported on with legitimate sources and many will be named by employees at the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday in the company's defense during the nine-week trial in London's High Court.",
      "Hurley, who like the prince brought similar phone hacking lawsuits against the publishers of the Daily Mirror and The Sun, said that she was unaware of similar allegations against the Mail until she was told in 2020 that Gavin Burrows, a former private eye, purportedly said that he had stolen her information at the behest of the newspapers.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- As more and more space junk comes crashing down, a new study shows how earthquake monitors can better track incoming objects by tuning into their sonic booms.",
      "Scientists reported Thursday that seismic readings from sonic booms that were generated when a discarded module from a Chinese crew capsule reentered over Southern California in 2024 allowed them to place the object's path nearly 20 miles (30 kilometers) farther south than radar had predicted from orbit.",
      "Using this method to track uncontrolled objects plummeting at supersonic speeds, they said, could help recovery teams reach any surviving pieces more quickly \u2014 crucial if the debris is dangerous.",
      "\u201cThe problem at the moment is we can track stuff very well in space,\u201d said Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Benjamin Fernando, the lead researcher. \u201cBut once it gets to the point that it\u2019s actually breaking up in the atmosphere, it becomes very difficult to track.\u201d",
      "His team\u2019s findings, published in the journal Science, focus on just one debris event. But the researchers already have used publicly available data from seismic networks to track a few dozen other reentries, including debris from three failed SpaceX Starship test flights in Texas.",
      "A growing concern among scientists and others is that falling space debris could strike a plane in flight.",
      "\u201cThere are thousands, tens of thousands, more satellites in orbit than there were 10 years ago,\u201d including SpaceX's Starlinks and other companies' internet satellites, said Fernando. \u201cUnfortunately, we don\u2019t really have anything other than the word of the company to say that when they break up, they completely burn up in the atmosphere.\u201d",
      "Fernando, who normally studies quakes on the moon and Mars, teamed up with Imperial College London\u2019s Constantinos Charalambous the day after the Chinese debris streaked across the California sky in 2024. Over time, they gathered data from more than 120 seismometers that captured the sonic booms from the reentry, using that data to plot the object's suspected path.",
      "China\u2019s out-of-control module had been abandoned in a decaying orbit ever since it was cut loose from the Shenzhou-15 capsule returning three Chinese astronauts from their country's space station in 2023. The 1.5-ton (1.36-metric tonne) module \u2014 more than 3 feet (1 meter) in size \u2014 broke into countless smaller pieces as it plummeted through the atmosphere, resulting in multiple sonic booms. Besides attempting to trace the object\u2019s fall, the seismic readings provided a sense of the cascading breakup, Fernando said.",

      "The strategic importance of the Arctic territory \u2014 under the flight paths that nuclear-armed missiles from China and Russia could take on their way to incinerating targets in the United States, and vice versa \u2014 is one of the reasons U.S. President Donald Trump has cited in his disruptive campaign to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark, alarming Greenlanders and longtime allies in Europe alike.",

On Saturday morning, he will climb it in his signature free solo style \u2014 without ropes or protective equipment. And Netflix will broadcast it \u2014 live.",
      "The event\u2019s announcement has drawn both excitement and trepidation, as well as some concerns over the ethical implications of attempting such a high-risk endeavor on live broadcast. Many have questioned Honnold\u2019s desire to continues his free-solo climbs now that he\u2019s a married father of two young girls.",
      "Known for his legendary ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan, documented in \u201cFree Solo,\u201d Honnold is intent on pushing the limits of climbing around the world.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at climbing objectives, you look for things that are singular,\u201d Honnold told The Associated Press late last year. \u201cSomething like El Capitan where it\u2019s way bigger and way prouder than all the things around it.\u201d",

      "Honnold won\u2019t be the first climber to ascend the skyscraper, but he will be the first to do so without a rope. French rock climber Alain Robert scaled the building on Christmas Day in 2004, as part of the grand opening of what was then the world's tallest building. He took nearly four hours to finish, almost twice as long as what he anticipated, all while nursing an injured elbow and battered by wind and rain.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be that extreme,\u201d Honnold said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see. I think it\u2019s the perfect sweet spot where it\u2019s hard enough to be engaging for me and obviously an interesting climb.\u201d",
      "The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors comprising the middle section \u2014 the \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment will have eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by a balcony that Honnold would be able to rest on.",
      "The \u201cSkyscraper Live\u201d broadcast will be on a 10-second delay and begin Friday evening for viewers in the U.S.",
      "James Smith, an executive with event producer Plimsoll Productions, said he consulted safety advisers almost immediately after he first spoke with Honnold about attempting the climb. Smith works with a risk management group for film and TV called Secret Compass, which has supported productions in filming penguins in Antarctica and helping Chris Hemsworth walk across a crane projecting from an Australian skyscraper's roof, alike.",
      "Smith and Honnold will be able to communicate throughout the event. They\u2019ll have cameramen positioned inside the building, various hatches and places to bail during the climb and four high-angle camera operators suspended on ropes.",
      "\u201cThese people all know Alex. They trust Alex. They\u2019re going to be close to him throughout the whole climb,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get us kind of amazing shots, but they\u2019re also there just to keep an eye on him, and if there\u2019s any problems, they can kind of help.\u201d",
      "The production has also commissioned professional weather forecasters to provide updates leading up to climb day. There's currently a small chance of light rain in the morning, Smith said. Ultimately, if conditions are bad, Honnold won\u2019t climb.",
      "At his local gym, Taiwanese rock climber Chin Tzu-hsiang said he\u2019s grown up always looking up at the Taipei 101 and wondering if he could climb it. Honnold is a household name among rock climbers even in Taiwan, and Chin said he has students who have only been climbing for a year or two who are excited to watch. Based on watching Honnold in his other climbs, Chin said he trusts him to prepare for the challenge and not to recklessly take risks.",

They warn that the frigid weather is likely to stick around through the rest of January and into early February, meaning the snow and ice that accumulates will take a long time to melt.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s forecast has the storm stretching from New Mexico to New England, threatening at least 250 million people.",
      "\u201cI think people are underestimating just how bad it\u2019s going to be,\u201d said former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist Ryan Maue, now a private meteorologist.",
      "The polar vortex, a patch of bitter cold air that often stays penned up in northern Canada and Alaska, is being elongated by a wave in the upper atmosphere that goes back to a relatively ice-free part of the Arctic and snow-buried Siberia. As the bone-chilling temperatures sweep through the U.S., they'll meet with moisture from off California and the Gulf of Mexico to set up crippling ice and snow in many areas.",
      "The origins of the system begin in the Arctic, where relatively warmer temperatures add energy to the polar vortex and help push its cold air south.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere is aligned perfectly that the pattern is locked into this warm Arctic, cold continent,\" Maue said. \"And it\u2019s not just here for us in North America, but the landmass of Eastern Europe to Siberia is also exceptionally cold. The whole hemisphere has gone into the deep freeze.\u201d",
      "As far back as October 2025, changes in the Arctic and low sea ice were setting up conditions for the kind of stretched polar vortex that brings severe winter weather to the U.S., said winter weather expert Judah Cohen, an MIT research scientist. Heavy Siberian snowfall added to the push-and-pull of weather that warps the shape of the normally mostly circular air pattern. Those conditions \u201ckind of loaded the dice a bit'' for a stretching of the polar vortex, he said.",
      "Cohen co-authored a July 2025 study that found more stretched polar vortex events linked to severe winter weather bursts in the central and eastern U.S. over the past decade. Cohen said part of the reason is that dramatically low sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas in the Arctic helps set up a pattern of waves that end up causing U.S. cold bursts. A warmer Arctic is causing sea ice in that region to shrink faster than other places, studies have found.",
      "Arctic sea ice is at a record low extent for this time of year, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.",
      "The center of the stretched polar vortex will be somewhere above Duluth, Minnesota, by Friday morning, ushering in \u201clong-lasting brutal cold,\u201d Maue said. Temperatures in the North and Midwest will get about as cold as possible, even down to minus 25 or 30 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 32 to minus 34 degrees Celsius), Maue said. The average low temperature for the Lower 48 states will dance around 11 or 12 degrees (minus 12 to minus 11 degrees Celsius) on Saturday, Sunday and Monday, Maue said.",

Treacherous freezing rain could stretch from the southern plains through the mid-South and into the Carolinas, he said.",

      "A new study finds that warming temperatures are causing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier, threatening some species with extinction by century's end",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Warming temperatures are forcing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier and that's a big problem for two of the cute tuxedoed species that face extinction by the end of the century, a study said.",
      "With temperatures in the breeding ground increasing 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) from 2012 to 2022, three different penguin species are beginning their reproductive process about two weeks earlier than the decade before, according to a study in Tuesday's Journal of Animal Ecology. And that sets up potential food problems for young chicks.",
      "\u201cPenguins are changing the time at which they\u2019re breeding at a record speed, faster than any other vertebrate,\u201d said lead author Ignacio Juarez Martinez, a biologist at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. \"And this is important because the time at which you breed needs to coincide with the time with most resources in the environment and this is mostly food for your chicks so they have enough to grow.''",
      "For some perspective, scientists have studied changes in the life cycle of great tits, a European bird. They found a similar two-week change, but that took 75 years as opposed to just 10 years for these three penguin species, said study co-author Fiona Suttle, another Oxford biologist.",
      "Researchers used remote control cameras to photograph penguins breeding in dozens of colonies from 2011 to 2021. They say it was the fastest shift in timing of life cycles for any backboned animals that they have seen. The three species are all brush-tailed, so named because their tails drag on the ice: the cartoon-eye Adelie, the black-striped chinstrap and the fast-swimming gentoo.",
      "Suttle said climate change is creating winners and losers among these three penguin species and it happens at a time in the penguin life cycle where food and the competition for it are critical in survival.",
      "The Adelie and chinstrap penguins are specialists, eating mainly krill. The gentoo have a more varied diet. They used to breed at different times, so there were no overlaps and no competition. But the gentoos' breeding has moved earlier faster than the other two species and now there's overlap. That's a problem because gentoos, which don't migrate as far as the other two species, are more aggressive in finding food and establishing nesting areas, Martinez and Suttle said.",
      "Suttle said she has gone back in October and November to the same colony areas where she used to see Adelies in previous years only to find their nests replaced by gentoos. And the data backs up the changes her eyes saw, she said.",
      "\u201cChinstraps are declining globally,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cModels show that they might get extinct before the end of the century at this rate. Adelies are doing very poorly in the Antarctic Peninsula and it\u2019s very likely that they go extinct from the Antarctic Peninsula before the end of the century.\u201d",
      "Martinez theorized that the warming western Antarctic \u2014 the second-fasting heating place on Earth behind only the Arctic North Atlantic \u2014 means less sea ice. Less sea ice means more spores coming out earlier in the Antarctic spring and then \u201cyou have this incredible bloom of phytoplankton,\u201d which is the basis of the food chain that eventually leads to penguins, he said. And it's happening earlier each year.",
      "Not only do the chinstraps and Adelies have more competition for food from gentoos because of the warming and changes in plankton and krill, but the changes have brought more commercial fishing that comes earlier and that further shortens the supply for the penguins, Suttle said.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- A surfer had minor injuries from being bitten by a shark Tuesday in the fourth attack off the coast of Australia's most populous state in three days.",
      "The shark attacked the man's surfboard at Point Plomer, 460 kilometers (290 miles) north of the New South Wales state capital, around 9 a.m., officials said.",
      "The man was lucky to survive with minor cuts, Kempsey-Crescent Head Surf Life Saving Club captain Matt Worrall said.",
      "\u201cThe board seemed to take most of the impact,\u201d Worrall told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \u201cHe made his own way into shore where he was assisted by locals.\u201d",
      "The bystanders drove the 39-year-old man to a hospital and he was later discharged.",
      "In the earlier attacks, a man and a boy suffered critical leg wounds and the surfboard of another boy was bitten by sharks at Sydney locations Sunday and Monday.",
      "Beaches along New South Wales' northern coast and northern Sydney were closed Tuesday and local authorities said Sydney's northern beaches would remain closed to swimmers and surfers for 48 hours. Electronic drumlines that alert authorities when a large shark has taken bait were deployed off the Sydney coast.",
      "Authorities warned that recent rainfall has left the water off area beaches murky, which increased the risk of bull shark attacks. Bull sharks are responsible for most attacks around Sydney.",
      "\u201cIf anyone's thinking of heading into the surf this morning anywhere along the northern beaches, think again. We have such poor water quality that\u2019s really conducive to some bull shark activity,\u201d Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steve Pearce said.",
      "\u201cIf you're thinking about going for a swim, just go to a local pool because at this stage, we\u2019re advising that beaches are unsafe,\u201d Peace added.",
      "On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was attacked after jumping from a 6-meter (20-foot) ledge known as Jump Rock near Shark Beach inside Sydney Harbor. Police have credited the boy\u2019s friends with saving his life by jumping from the cliff during the attack and dragging him back to shore.",

      "\"I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there. The United Kingdom alone had 457 service personnel killed,\" he said.",

      "A major, dayslong winter storm is threatening to bring snow, sleet, ice and extensive power outages to about half the U.S. population. Thousands of weekend flights already have been canceled, and forecasters warn that catastrophic damage, especially in areas pounded by ice, could rival that of a hurricane.",
      "Here's a guide for travelers as flight disruptions start stacking up:",
      "When airlines expect bad weather to create problems for flights, they often give travelers a chance to postpone their trips by a few days without having to pay a fee. Search online for your airline\u2019s name and \u201ctravel alerts\u201d or similar phrases to look for possible rescheduling offers.",
      "American Airlines, for example, said it is waiving change fees for passengers impacted by the storm, which brought freezing rain to parts of Texas on Friday. The Texas-based airline has canceled more than 1,200 flights scheduled to depart Saturday, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.",

      "If you're already at the airport, get in line to speak to a customer service representative. If you're still at home or at your hotel, call or go online to connect to your airline's reservations staff.

      "If your flight was canceled and you no longer want to take the trip, or you've found another way to get to your destination, the airline is legally required to refund your money \u2014 even if you bought a non-refundable ticket. It doesn't matter why the flight was canceled.",

      "U.S. airlines aren't required by the Transportation Department to compensate passengers for meals or lodging when an airline cancels or significantly delays a flight during an \u201cuncontrollable\u201d event like bad weather.",
      "Each airline, however, does have its own policies for assisting passengers who are stranded by a so-called \u201ccontrollable\u201d flight cancellation or long delay. These include disruptions caused by maintenance issues, crew shortages or computer outages that halt operations. The Transportation Department can hold airlines accountable for these commitments and maintains a website that lets travelers see what each airline promises if a major disruption is their fault.",
      "If the weather forecast is troubling, Kyle Potter, executive editor of Thrifty Traveler, suggests looking into booking a backup flight. Some airlines stand out as potential backups, Potter says, because they let customers get a full refund as long as they cancel within 24 hours of booking.",
      "The customer service phone lines will be slammed if flight cancellations and delays start stacking up during a bad storm. If you're traveling with someone who has a higher frequent-flyer status, call the airline using their priority number. Another trick: Look up the airline\u2019s international support number.

      "Federal immigration officials say more than 100 people have been detained in Maine this week as part of an enforcement surge targeting what ICE calls \u201cthe worst of the worst.\u201d",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement has highlighted the detention of people whom it called some of Maine\u2019s most dangerous criminals during operations this past week, but court records paint a more complicated picture.",
      "Federal officials say more than 100 people have been detained statewide in what ICE dubbed \u201cOperation Catch of the Day,\u201d a reference to the fishing industry. ICE said in a statement that it was arresting the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d including \u201cchild abusers and hostage takers.\u201d",
      "Court records show some were violent felons. But they also show other detainees with unresolved immigration proceedings or who were arrested but never convicted of a crime.",
      "Immigration attorneys and local officials say similar concerns have surfaced in other cities where ICE has conducted enforcement surges and many of those targeted lacked criminal records.",
      "One case highlighted by ICE that involves serious felony offenses and criminal convictions is that of Sudan native Dominic Ali. ICE said Ali was convicted of false imprisonment, aggravated assault, assault, obstructing justice and violating a protective order.",
      "Court records show Ali was convicted in 2004 of violating a protective order and in 2008 of second-degree assault, false imprisonment and obstructing the reporting of a crime. In the latter case, prosecutors said he threw his girlfriend to the floor of her New Hampshire apartment, kicked her and broke her collarbone.",
      "\u201cHis conduct amounted to nothing less than torture,\u201d Judge James Barry said in 2009 before sentencing Ali to five to 10 years in prison.",
      "Ali was later paroled to ICE custody, and in 2013 an immigration judge ordered his removal. No further information was available from the Executive Office for Immigration Review, and it remains unclear what happened after that order.",
      "Other cases were more nuanced, like that of Elmara Correia, an Angola native whom ICE highlighted in its public promotion of the operation, saying she was \u201carrested previously for endangering the welfare of a child.\u201d",
      "Maine court records show someone with that name was charged in 2023 with violating a law related to learner\u2019s permits for new drivers, a case that was later dismissed.",
      "Correia filed a petition Wednesday challenging her detention, and a judge issued a temporary emergency order barring authorities from transferring her from Massachusetts, where she is being held. Her attorney said she entered the United States legally on a student visa about eight years ago and has never been subject to expedited removal proceedings.",
      "\u201cWas she found not guilty, or are we just going to be satisfied that she was arrested?\u201d Portland Mayor Mark Dion said during a news conference in which he raised concerns that ICE failed to distinguish between arrests and convictions or explain whether sentences were served.",
      "Dion also pointed to another person named in the release: Dany Lopez-Cortez, whom ICE said is a \u201ccriminal illegal alien\u201d from Guatemala who was convicted of operating under the influence.",
      "ICE highlighted Lopez-Cortez\u2019s case among a small group of examples it said reflected the types of arrests made during the operation. Dion questioned whether an operating-under-the-influence conviction, a serious offense but one commonly seen in Maine, should rise to the level of ICE\u2019s \u201cworst of the worst\u201d public narrative.",

      "The Pentagon has released a National Defense Strategy that chastises U.S. allies to take control of their own security and reasserts the Trump administration\u2019s focus on dominance in the Western Hemisphere over a longtime goal of countering China",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon released a priority-shifting National Defense Strategy late Friday that chastised U.S. allies to take control of their own security and reasserted the Trump administration\u2019s focus on dominance in the Western Hemisphere above a longtime goal of countering China.",
      "The 34-page document, the first since 2022, was highly political for a military blueprint, criticizing partners from Europe to Asia for relying on previous U.S. administrations to subsidize their defense. It called for \u201ca sharp shift \u2014 in approach, focus, and tone.\u201d That translated to a blunt assessment that allies would take on more of the burden countering nations from Russia to North Korea.",
      "\u201cFor too long, the U.S. Government neglected \u2014 even rejected \u2014 putting Americans and their concrete interests first,\u201d read the opening sentence.",
      "It capped off a week of animosity between President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and traditional allies like Europe, with Trump threatening to impose tariffs on some European partners to press a bid to acquire Greenland before announcing a deal that lowered the temperature.",
      "As allies confront what some see as a hostile attitude from the U.S., they will almost certainly be unhappy to see that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s department will provide \u201ccredible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain,\u201d especially Greenland and the Panama Canal.",
      "Following a tiff this week at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, the strategy at once urges cooperation with Canada and other neighbors while still issuing a stark warning.",
      "\u201cWe will engage in good faith with our neighbors, from Canada to our partners in Central and South America, but we will ensure that they respect and do their part to defend our shared interests,\u201d the document says. \u201cAnd where they do not, we will stand ready to take focused, decisive action that concretely advances U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Much like the White House\u2019s National Security Strategy that preceded it, the defense blueprint reinforces Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy, which favors nonintervention overseas, questions decades of strategic relationships and prioritizes U.S. interests. The National Defense Strategy last was published in 2022 under then-President Joe Biden and focused on China as America\u2019s \u201cpacing challenge.\u201d",
      "The strategy simultaneously courts help from partners in America\u2019s backyard, while warning them that the U.S. will \u201cactively and fearlessly defend America\u2019s interests throughout the Western Hemisphere.\u201d",
      "It specifically points to access to the Panama Canal and Greenland. It comes just days after Trump said he reached a \u201cframework of a future deal\u201d on Arctic security with NATO leader Mark Rutte that would offer the U.S. \u201ctotal access\u201d to Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.",
      "Danish officials, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations, say formal negotiations have yet to begin.",
      "Trump previously suggested that the U.S. should potentially consider retaking control of the Panama Canal and accused Panama of ceding influence to China. Asked this week if the U.S. reclaiming the canal was still on the table, Trump demurred.",

      "The Pentagon also touted the operation that ousted Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro earlier this month, saying \u201call narco-terrorists should take note.\u201d",
      "The new policy document views China \u2014 which the Biden administration saw as a top adversary \u2014 as a settled force in the Indo-Pacific region that only needs to be deterred from dominating the U.S. or its allies.",
      "The goal \u201cis not to dominate China; nor is it to strangle or humiliate them,\u201d the document says. It later adds, \u201cThis does not require regime change or some other existential struggle.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump seeks a stable peace, fair trade, and respectful relations with China,\u201d it says, which follows efforts to climb down from a trade war sparked by the administration\u2019s sky-high tariffs. It says it will \u201copen a wider range of military-to-military communications\u201d with China\u2019s army.",
      "The strategy, meanwhile, makes no mention of or guarantee to Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own and says it will take by force if necessary. The U.S. is obligated by its own laws to give military support to Taiwan.",
      "By contrast, the Biden administration\u2019s 2022 strategy said the U.S. would \u201csupport Taiwan\u2019s asymmetric self-defense.\u201d",
      "In another example of offloading regional security to allies, the document says, \u201cSouth Korea is capable of taking primary responsibility for deterring North Korea with critical but more limited U.S. support.\u201d",
      "While saying that \u201cRussia will remain a persistent but manageable threat to NATO\u2019s eastern members for the foreseeable future,\u201d the defense strategy asserts that NATO allies are much more powerful and so are \u201cstrongly positioned to take primary responsibility for Europe\u2019s conventional defense.\u201d",
      "It says the Pentagon will play a key role in NATO \u201ceven as we calibrate U.S. force posture and activities in the European theater\u201d to focus on priorities closer to home.",
      "The U.S. already has confirmed that it will reduce its troop presence on NATO\u2019s borders with Ukraine, with allies expressing concern that the Trump administration might drastically cut their numbers and leave a security vacuum as European countries confront an increasingly aggressive Russia.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The detention of a 5-year-old Ecuadorian boy with his father outside their home in Minnesota has become the latest lightning rod for America\u2019s divisions on immigration under the Trump administration. Versions offered by government officials and the family's attorney and neighbors offer contradictory versions of whether the parents were given adequate opportunity to leave the child with someone else.",
      "Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as \u201cbait\u201d by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security calls that description of events an \u201cabject lie.\u201d It says the father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot and left the boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, in a running vehicle in their driveway.",
      "The dueling narratives come just two weeks after the deadly shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer that witnesses also viewed as a blatant abuse of power \u2014 and that the government defended as a legitimate act of self-defense.",
      "The father and son are now at family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, near San Antonio.",
      "Federal officials say the father was in the U.S. illegally, without offering details. Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, said he came illegally in December 2024.",
      "The family\u2019s attorney said he had a pending asylum claim allowing him to stay in the country.",
      "Both can be true. The government may have tried deporting him after determining he entered illegally but he may have exercised a legal right to seek asylum, putting his removal on hold until a judge rules on his claim.",
      "An online court summary shows the case was filed on Dec. 17, 2024, and is assigned to the immigration court inside the Dilley detention center.",
      "Here's a look at what various officials, lawyers and others are saying about the case:",
      "Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik told reporters that the officers instructed the boy to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, \u201cessentially using a 5-year-old as bait,\u201d she said.",
      "The father told the child\u2019s mother, who was inside, not to open the door, Stenvik said.",
      "School officials said the agents wouldn\u2019t leave Liam with other adults.",
      "A photo of the boy wearing a beanie and a Spiderman backpack has circulated widely on social media, sparking strong reactions.",
      "\u201cWhy detain a 5-year-old?\u201d the superintendent asked. \u201cYou cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.\u201d",
      "School officials said other adults at the scene offered to care for the boy but were ignored by agents, including a neighbor who said they had papers authorizing her to take care of Liam on behalf of the parents.",
      "Mary Granlund, school board chair for Columbia Heights, said she told agents that she also could take care of him.",
      "\u201cICE did NOT target, arrest a child or use a child as \u2018bait,\u2019\u201d said Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin. \u201cICE law enforcement officers were the only people primarily concerned with the welfare of this child. \u201d",
      "McLaughlin said the child was abandoned and officers tried extensively to get the mother to take custody of the child. \u201cOfficers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody.\u201d",
      "The officers, she said, \u201cabided by the father\u2019s wishes to keep the child with him.\"",

      "Guan Heng sought asylum in the United States after exposing human rights abuses in his native China",
      "WASHINGTON -- Guan Heng, who exposed human rights abuses in his native China, has been in U.S. custody since being swept up in an immigration enforcement operation in August. He says he dares not even think about what would happen to him if he were sent back.",
      "\u201cI would be prosecuted, I would be jailed, I would be tortured. All of that could happen,\u201d Guan, 38, told The Associated Press in a recent call from the Broome County Correctional Facility in New York.",
      "A judge on Monday is to consider his appeal to remain in the United States, where he sought asylum after fleeing his homeland more than four years ago to publish video footage of detention facilities in China\u2019s Xinjiang region.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security initially sought to deport him to Uganda, but dropped the plan in December after his plight raised public concerns and attracted attention on Capitol Hill. But his future remains unclear.",
      "Guan said the public attention has given him hope. During his first months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, he said \u201cthere was no help from the outside world\u201d and stories from fellow detainees and reports of the Trump administration's anti-immigration campaign left him extremely pessimistic.",
      "He is among tens of thousands of asylum seekers who have been swept up in mass deportation efforts in the past year despite having what they believed to be legitimate claims to stay in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe are very worried about the number of asylum seekers that will be sent back to extremely dangerous conditions,\u201d said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying to see that an institution like asylum is being so eroded.\u201d",
      "Guan said ICE agents stumbled upon him during an operation targeting his housemates in the small town where he was living outside of Albany.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokesperson, said ICE encountered Guan when assisting the FBI in executing a criminal search warrant.",
      "\u201cThis illegal alien from China entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time,\u201d she said in a written response to a request for comment. \u201cAll of his claims will be heard before an immigration judge.\u201d",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a member of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, has urged Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to release Guan and approve his asylum request.",
      "In a statement to the AP on Friday in reference to Guan's case, the Illinois Democrat called for \u201ccareful adherence to due process and America\u2019s long-standing commitment to protecting human rights whistleblowers.\u201d",
      "Immigrants can apply for asylum when there\u2019s a fear of harm back home because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said the Trump administration is making a concerted effort to remove asylum seekers. Rather than allowing them to stay in the country while their cases are pending, immigration authorities are closing out cases and giving people removal orders so they can be rapidly deported, she said.",
      "Federal data by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system, shows that 170,626 asylum seekers were ordered deported in 2025. That's about one-third of the half million people the Trump administration ordered deported last year.",
      "The data also show that 31% of asylum applications were abandoned in 2025, up from 11% between 2010 and 2024. Usually, a case gets marked \u201cabandoned\u201d when the applicant misses an appointment, said Bartlomiej Skorupa, the group\u2019s chief operating officer. He said it's not yet clear what caused the rise.",

      "A reality TV series meant to showcase the New York Police Department has spawned a legal showdown between city government and the show\u2019s producer, Jordan McGraw \u2014 the son of TV\u2019s Dr. Phil",
      "NEW YORK -- A reality TV series meant to spotlight the New York Police Department has spawned a real-life legal drama involving the city and the show\u2019s producer, Jordan McGraw \u2014 the son of TV\u2019s \u201cDr. Phil\u201d McGraw.",
      "The city sued the younger McGraw and his production company this week for breach of contract and obtained a court order that blocks them, at least temporarily, from selling or disseminating any footage from the unfinished and unaired show, tentatively titled \u201cBehind the Badge.\u201d",
      "\"Dr. Phil\" McGraw\u2014 a clinical psychologist turned TV personality \u2014 hosted the series, interviewing officials and showing up to crime scenes. Episodes were slated to air on his MeritTV cable and streaming channels, where he'd previously done segments featuring the police department.",
      "On Thursday, McGraw\u2019s lawyers filed to move the case from New York state court to federal court.",
      "The city abandoned \u201cBehind the Badge\u201d late last year, hours before then-Mayor Eric Adams ceded City Hall to Zohran Mamdani, after saying that it had expressed concerns to McGraw about the documentary-style show\u2019s quality and content.",
      "Episode \u201crough cuts\u201d provided to the city by McGraw\u2019s company, McGraw Media, were mostly \u201cunedited footage\u201d dumps and included material not allowed under McGraw\u2019s production agreement with the city, such as discussions of sensitive operations and the identities of undercover officers, crime victims and witnesses, the lawsuit said.",
      "\u201cIntended to highlight the extraordinary work of the NYPD\u201d with special behind-the-scenes access, \u201cBehind the Badge\u201d at times portrayed the nation\u2019s largest police force negatively, violating the agreement, the lawsuit said.",
      "Jordan McGraw and McGraw Media have since \u201cdisavowed their obligations\u201d and attempted to wrest editorial control over the project from the city, \u201crisking immediate and irreparable harm\u201d to the city, the lawsuit said.",
      "Chip Babcock, a lawyer for Jordan McGraw and McGraw Media, said the lawsuit came as a surprise \u201cas publication of any programming was not imminent.\" McGraw Media, he said, \u201chad worked with the city to address the edits requested\" and is willing to continue to do so. The company will seek to remove the court order as soon as possible, Babcock said, calling it a presumptively unconstitutional prior restraint.",
      "New York City partnered with McGraw Media on \u201cBehind the Badge\u201d last April, inking a three-year contract a day after a federal judge dismissed federal corruption charges against Adams. The case went away, in part, because the Justice Department had wanted the mayor\u2019s help with President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "Last week, WNBC-TV reported that Adams' campaign paid $500,000 for another Jordan McGraw company, Fairfax Digital, to produce social media ads.",

      "A federal judge ruled that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration ...",
      "BOSTON -- A federal judge ruled on Thursday that the academics, who are party to a lawsuit alleging U.S. policy singles out noncitizens for detention or deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses, can seek relief from the court if their immigration status is changed as retribution for taking part in the case.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Judge William Young comes in the wake of trial last year, in which he ruled the Trump administration violated the Constitution when it targeted non-U.S. citizens for deportation solely for supporting Palestinians and criticizing Israel. Young repeatedly chastised the administration for violating the First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs and, on Thursday, issued what he described as \u201cremedial sanction to protect certain of the Plaintiffs\u2019 noncitizen members from any retribution for the free exercise of their constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "During the hearing in the case earlier this month, Young maintained that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and their agents had engaged in an \u201cunconstitutional conspiracy\u201d to limit the free speech of the plaintiffs, creating a chilling effect on their rights by their attempts to \u201cpick off certain people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe big problem in this case is that the cabinet secretaries, ostensibly and president of the United States, are not honoring the First Amendment,\u201d said Young, an appointee of the late Republican President Ronald Reagan. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be an understanding of what the First Amendment is by this government.\u201d",
      "In his ruling, Young said that a noncitizen challenging his or her immigration status change would have to prove that they were a member of the American Association of University Professors and Middle East Studies Association, the two groups that sued, between March 25, 2025, and Sept. 30, 2025. They would also have to show their immigration status had not expired and had not committed any crime after Sept. 30, 2025. The Associated Press is not aware of any members of these groups whose status has changed because they are part of the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cUpon such proof, it shall be presumed that the alteration in immigration status is in retribution for the exercise during the course of the present case of their First Amendment rights,\u201d Young wrote.",
      "A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment",
      "During last year's trial, witnesses for the government acknowledged that the campaign targeted more than 5,000 pro-Palestinian protesters. Other witnesses for the plaintiffs testified to how the campaign stoked fear among academics and prompted some to stop their activism.",
      "Among the cases that have fueled the lawsuit was that of former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil. Earlier this month, a federal appeals panel reversed a lower court decision that released Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.",
      "The three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals didn\u2019t decide the key issue in Khalil\u2019s case: whether the Trump administration\u2019s effort to throw Khalil out of the U.S. over his campus activism and criticism of Israel was unconstitutional.",
      "But in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn\u2019t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The House rejected a Democratic-backed resolution Thursday that would have prevented President Donald Trump from sending U.S. military forces to Venezuela after a tied vote on the legislation fell just short of the majority needed for passage.",
      "The tied vote was the latest sign of Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson's tenuous hold on the majority, as well as some of the growing pushback in the GOP-controlled Congress to Trump's aggressions in the Western Hemisphere. A Senate vote on a similar resolution was also tied last week until Vice President JD Vance broke the deadlock.",
      "To defeat the resolution Thursday, Republican leaders had to hold the vote open for more than 20 minutes while Republican Rep. Wesley Hunt, who had been out of Washington all week campaigning for a Senate seat in Texas, rushed back to Capitol Hill to cast the decisive vote.",
      "On the House floor, Democrats responded with shouts that Republican leaders were violating the chamber's procedural rules. Two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky \u2014 voted with all Democrats for the legislation.",

      "Thursday's vote was the latest test in Congress of how much leeway Republicans will give a president who campaigned on removing the U.S. from foreign entanglements but has increasingly reached for military options to impose his will in the Western Hemisphere. So far, almost all Republicans have declined to put checks on Trump through the war powers votes.",
      "Rep. Brian Mast, the Republican chair of the House Armed Services Committee, accused Democrats of bringing the war powers resolution to a vote out of \u201cspite\u201d for Trump.",

      "Still, Democrats stridently argued that Congress needs to assert its role in determining when the president can use wartime powers. They have been able to force a series of votes in both the House and Senate as Trump, in recent months, ramped up his campaign against Maduro and set his sights on other conflicts overseas.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump is reducing the United States to a regional bully with fewer allies and more enemies,\u201d Rep.

      "When big winter storms move in, they can bring nasty weather that shows up as different things in different places \u2014 maybe it\u2019s snow, or sleet, or freezing rain",
      "When big winter storms move in, they can bring nasty weather that ranges from snow to sleet and freezing rain \u2014 or maybe extreme and dangerous cold.",
      "Here's a look at some weather conditions and how they vary from place to place.",
      "To stick, snow needs consistent cold air all the way from where flakes form in the clouds to the ground. If it's below freezing the whole way, the snowflakes never melt, so nothing turns to ice.",
      "\u201cThe further north, the deeper that Arctic layer is, the more likely to support snow,\u201d said MIT research scientist Judah Cohen.",
      "Farther south, the atmosphere may include a sandwich of warm air between cold layers. That's how sleet and freezing rain happen.",
      "\u201cThe snowflakes form, they fall and then they meet a warm layer, a layer above freezing, and they will melt. But then there's another layer near the surface that's below freezing again, so they will refreeze before they hit the ground,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "Sleet requires the lowest layer to be cold enough that raindrops refreeze when they hit the ground, creating bouncy ice pellets. If that lower cold layer is shallow, the rain doesn't have enough time to freeze in the air. So it hits the ground as raindrops that freeze when they make contact.",
      "Then there's graupel, which is a rarer mix between snow and sleet. Not quite fluffy, and not quite hard.",
      "\u201cIt's snow that has tried to melt on its way down, but not quite melted,\u201d said David Robinson, New Jersey state climatologist at Rutgers University. \u201cIt's out of that six-point crystalline shape and has begun to look more like a cotton ball. So it hasn't gotten to the point of full melt that it could then refreeze as sleet.\u201d",
      "There's also hail, which Robinson said some people mistakenly use to describe sleet. But real hail probably isn't happening in a winter storm. That usually happens in the summer because it requires warmer air that's closer to the surface. That creates an updraft that allows rain to move up, freeze, fall, and move up again, forming layers of ice similar to the layers of an onion.",
      "Snow can be dangerous \u2014 sufficient to send cars skidding into ditches and be life-threatening in whiteout conditions. But at least it can be plowed.",

      "Members of the Florida Legislative Black Caucus denounced the opinion at a news conference on Thursday. They decried it as a political stunt that could end decades of bipartisan policies while ignoring Florida's history of racial discrimination. Up until the 1960s, Florida subscribed to the legal system of racial segregation in schools and public accommodations known as Jim Crow.",
      "\u201cI know he doesn\u2019t understand this, and I know he doesn\u2019t have our lived experience, but I wish he would listen when we explain the reality of our lives and what people go through in our communities,\u201d said state Rep. Fentrice Driskell, who is the Democratic leader in the GOP-controlled Florida House. \u201cCivil rights laws are protections against discrimination, not preferences. This is about leveling the playing field, making sure that Floridians who look like us, and Floridians who look like the attorney general, have the same opportunities.\u201d",
      "Uthmeier, who is white, was named to his position last year by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis after then-state Attorney General Ashley Moody was appointed by the governor to a U.S. Senate seat left vacant by Marco Rubio when he became President Donald Trump's secretary of state.

      "Because this year's race included a new category for casting, many thought that might help tip the scales. However, since \"Sinners\" blew past the old record and scored a total of 16 nominations, the film didn't even need the new category to set that new record.",

      "What were the biggest snubs of the Oscar nominations?",
      "Among acting snubs, Chase Infiniti (\"One Battle After Another\") was tipped to be nominated for best actress, and Paul Mescal (\"Hamnet\") was expected in best supporting actor, however some noted that there may have been category confusion over whether the two were leading or supporting performances.",

      "Many expected Iranian director Jafar Panahi to make the best director shortlist for his Palme d'Or-winning feature \"It Was Just an Accident.\" He did secure a nomination for best original screenplay, and the film itself landed in a very competitive best international feature race, but many thought it would also factor into the best picture category.",
      "The best director race was always going to boast a few high-profile snubs, but most expected Guillermo Del Toro (\"Frankenstein\") to factor in, given his nomination at the Directors Guild Awards.",
      "After \"Wicked\" earned 10 Oscar nominations last year, many thought its sequel would factor into at least a few races, despite more tepid critical notices. In the end, the film was blanked entirely. Not quite as stark a departure from earlier heats, but James Cameron's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" also earned just two nominations, a franchise low.",

There will also be short film programs, experimental and episodic works, and conversations and panel discussions with filmmakers and Sundance alumni. [Click here\u00a0for ticket information.]",
      "This year's Sundance Film Festival is the last to be held in Park City. The festival \u2014 which originated in 1978 as the United States Film Festival, before being taken over by the Sundance Institute \u2014 has outgrown its location and will be held next year in Boulder, Colorado.",
      "This also marks the first festival to be held since the passing of Robert Redford, who helped shape the festival into a champion for independent filmmakers and creatives from marginalized communities.",
      "Amanda Kelso, acting CEO of the Sundance Institute, said, \"The 2026 Sundance Film Festival will be a truly pivotal and memorable moment as we celebrate artists and their visionary works, honor our Sundance Institute founder, Robert Redford, and his transformative vision, and show our gratitude to Utah by commemorating our collective journey.\"",
      "Part of that commemoration is through retrospective screenings of some of the biggest hits to have come out of Sundance, from \"Little Miss Sunshine\" to \"Half Nelson,\" starring Ryan Gosling.",
      "As a sign of how far the festival has come, this year's program was selected from more than 16,200 submissions, including 4,255 feature-length films, from 164 countries or territories. Jury prizes will be awarded in the categories of domestic and international narrative and non-fiction films, shorts, and the NEXT sidebar (which promotes innovative approaches to storytelling).",

      "\"Broken English\" is a genre-twisting tribute to Marianne Faithfull, who died a year ago, and features Tilda Swinton, George MacKay, Nick Cave, Suki Waterhouse and others painting a portrait of the singer-songwriter.",
      "Justice, civil rights and equality are the themes of \"Who Killed Alex Odeh?\"\u00a0about the search for truth in the 1985 California bombing that killed a prominent Palestinian American activist; \"Everybody to Kenmure Street,\"\u00a0in which hundreds of residents in a Scottish neighborhood fight off a deportation raid affecting their neighbors; \"Soul Patrol,\"\u00a0a history of the first Black special operations team of the Vietnam War; and \"Sentient,\"\u00a0an investigation into laboratory research on primates.",

      "Art and media are the focus of several films: \"Public Access\" traces the history of the development of public access television, as it grew from a legally-required offering on New York City cable TV in the early 1970s, to a controversial battleground for free speech. \"Seized\" recounts the story of a newspaper in the small town of Marion, Kansas, that was raided by police, unearthing a deeper story about abuse of power, community journalism, and the fact that \"deleted\" text messages aren't necessarily gone forever.",
      "\"Once Upon a Time in Harlem\" brings to life footage captured by the late filmmaker William Greaves when he documented a 1972 gathering of the living luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance. Mark Cousins' \"The Story of Documentary Film\" looks at the evolution of non-fiction cinema.",

    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 22:30:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The FCC is warning that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates, taking aim at a genre of TV that has long drawn President Trump's ire.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Communications Commission warned TV broadcasters Wednesday that daytime talk shows and late-night programs must give equal time to opposing political candidates.",
      "The move addressed a genre of TV that President Trump has long argued is politically biased, leading to calls from the president to revoke broadcasters' FCC licenses.",
      "The announcement hinges on a decades-old federal law requiring any FCC-licensed broadcaster that lets a political candidate appear on its airwaves to also offer \"equal opportunities\" to all other candidates running for the same office. The law exempts \"bona fide newscasts\" and news interviews from the equal time rule.",
      "In 2006, the FCC said the news exemption applied to an interview on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" meaning the late-night comedy show could feature then-California gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger on-air without also inviting his Democratic opponent.",
      "But in a four-page notice on Wednesday, the FCC said it is \"not the case\" that all late-night and daytime entertainment shows are exempt. The regulator said it decides whether the exemption applies on a case-by-case basis, and it \"has not been presented with any evidence\" that interviews on those shows qualify for the news exemption.",
      "FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump ally, wrote on X: \"For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes. Today, the FCC reminded them of their obligation to provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"",
      "The FCC did not call out any specific shows by name. But Mr. Trump reposted a news headline on Truth Social that said the FCC is taking \"aim\" at two ABC shows that have long drawn the president's ire \u2014 \"The View\" and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" Carr shared a screenshot of Mr. Trump's post on X.",
      "ABC did not respond to a request for comment from CBS News on the FCC's notice. NBC and CBS, which also air late-night shows criticized by Mr. Trump, declined to comment.",
      "Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez sharply criticized the FCC's announcement, calling it \"an escalation in this FCC's ongoing campaign to censor and control speech.\" She also argued the notice was \"misleading\" since the FCC hasn't formally changed any of its rules, a process that typically involves a public comment period and a vote by the commissioners.",
      "\"Broadcasters should not feel pressured to water down, sanitize, or avoid critical coverage out of fear of regulatory retaliation,\" Gomez said in a statement. \"Broadcast stations have a constitutional right to carry newsworthy content, even when that content is critical of those in power. That does not change today, it will not change tomorrow, and it will not change simply because of this Administration's desire to silence its critics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has feuded with critical talk show hosts for years. He celebrated CBS parent company Paramount's decision to end \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" last summer, and he hailed ABC's decision in September to temporarily preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" following comments Kimmel made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. And he's publicly called on NBC to fire late-night hosts Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers.",
      "The president has also long argued that the FCC should revoke TV broadcast licenses for networks that consistently criticize him. The FCC has traditionally exerted limited influence over the content aired by TV networks, partly due to First Amendment constraints.",
      "\"They give me only bad publicity or press,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in September. \"I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr.\"",
      "The issue has drawn the attention of Carr, who has regularly pointed to laws requiring broadcasters to operate in the \"public interest.\"",
      "Hours before ABC temporarily took Kimmel off the air, Carr publicly urged the Disney-owned TV network to \"take action\" in response to the comedian's remarks on Kirk, saying in a podcast interview that \"there are avenues here for the FCC.\"",
      "\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said at the time.",
      "Those comments drew bipartisan criticism, with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas arguing Carr overstepped and could set a bad precedent the next time there's a Democratic president.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" Cruz said of Carr's remarks on Kimmel, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",

    "story": [
      "Prince Harry struck a combative tone as he testified Wednesday in his lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mail and insisted that his latest legal battle with Associated Newspaper Ltd. was \"in the public interest.\"",
      "Harry and six other prominent figures, including Elton John and actor Elizabeth Hurley, allege that the publisher invaded their privacy by engaging in a \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\" for two decades, attorney David Sherborne said. The celebrities allege that the company illegally spied on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records. Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, is set to be used in the trial.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the roughly 50 articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included close associates willing to inform on their famous friends.",
      "Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the intrusion into his early life by the Mail and its sister publication the Mail on Sunday, and that it made him \"paranoid beyond belief.\" Harry also alleged that the lives of \"thousands of people\" were \"invaded\" by Associated \"because of greed.\"",
      "\"There is obviously a personal element to bringing this claim, motivated by truth, justice and accountability, but it is not just about me,\" Harry said in a written statement unveiled as he entered the witness box. Under the English civil court system, witnesses present written testimony, and after asserting that it's the truth are immediately put under cross examination. \"I am determined to hold Associated accountable, for everyone's sake ... I believe it is in the public interest.\"",
      "A heated cross examination",
      "Harry, dressed in a dark suit, held a small Bible in his right hand in London's High Court and swore to \"almighty God that the evidence I shall give will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\" After the Duke of Sussex said he preferred to be called Prince Harry, he acknowledged that his 23-page statement was authentic and accurate.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White, in a calm and gentle tone, began to put questions to Harry to determine if the sourcing of the articles, in fact, had come from royal correspondents working their sources at official events or from friends or associates of the prince. Harry said that his \"social circles were not leaky\" and disputed suggestions that he had been cozy with journalists who covered the royal family.",
      "Harry suggested that information had come from eavesdropping on his phone calls or having private investigators snoop on him. He said journalist Katie Nicholl had the luxury to use the term \"unidentified source\" deceptively to hide unlawful measures of investigation.",
      "\"If you complain, they double down on you in my experience,\" he said in explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time.",
      "As a soft-spoken Harry became increasingly defensive, White said: \"I am intent on you not having a bad experience with me, but it is my job to ask you these questions.\"",
      "Eventually, Justice Matthew Nicklin intervened in the tense back-and-forth and told Harry not to argue with the defense lawyer as he tried to explain what it's like living under what he called \"24-hour surveillance.\" Nicklin also reminded Harry that he does not \"have to bear the burden of arguing the case today.\"",
      "At another point in his cross examination, Harry appeared close to tears as he said tabloids had made his wife Meghan's life \"an absolute misery.\" Harry has previously said persistent press attacks led to the couple's decision to leave royal life and move to the U.S. in 2020.",
      "Harry's media crusade",
      "For decades, Harry has had what he called an \"uneasy\" relationship with the media, but kept mum and followed the family protocol of \"never complain, never explain,\" he said.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris.",
      "He said \"vicious persistent attacks,\" harassment and event racists articles about Meghan, who is biracial, had inspired him to break from family tradition to finally sue the press.",
      "It is Harry's second time testifying after he bucked House of Windsor tradition and became the first senior royal to testify in a court in well over a century when he took the stand in a similar, successful lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror in 2023.",
      "Last year, on the eve of another scheduled trial, Rupert Murdoch's U.K. tabloid publisher NGN agreed to pay Harry \"substantial damages\" for privacy breaches, including phone hacking.",
      "This trial is expected to last nine weeks and a written verdict could come months later.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, told CBS News on Monday. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

The attorneys in a court filing argue that the complaint characterizes the interviews as a failure to disclose abuse, but an \"unequivocal denial is materially different from a mere absence of disclosure.\"",
      "According to the criminal complaint, one of the boys disclosed during a therapy session that he was inappropriately touched by the show's director. Those records were obtained by police during the investigation.",
      "Arguing Tuesday for Busfield's continued detention, Bernalillo County  Assistant District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch called evidence of abuse against Busfield strong and specific.",
      "\"The boys' allegation are supported by medical findings and by their therapist,\" Brandenburg-Koch said. \"Their accounts were specific and not exaggerated.\"",
      "She also described a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over the past three decades. Prosecutors also say witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "\"GPS is not going to tell this court if he is around children or talking to witnesses,\" Brandenburg-Koch said.",
      "Busfield's attorneys have argued that the allegations emerged only after the boys lost their role in the TV show, creating a financial and retaliatory motive. The filings detailed what the attorneys said was a history of fraud by both the boys' father and mother. They cited an investigation by Warner Bros. that found the allegations unfounded.",
      "Busfield also submitted letters vouching for his character, and his attorneys say he passed an independent polygraph test.",
      "Legal experts say New Mexico is among a few states that allow polygraph evidence in criminal cases, but a judge has final say over whether one can be used. There are strict requirements for admission.",

    "summary": "An assistant for \"Queer Eye\" star Karamo Brown told \"CBS Mornings\" he would not be joining Tuesday's interview with the cast ahead of the release of the series' 10th and final season.",
    "story": [
      "\"Queer Eye\" star Karamo Brown was notably absent from Tuesday's \"CBS Mornings\" live interview with the full cast as they promoted the release of the series' 10th and final season, citing a need to prioritize his mental health.",
      "Roughly an hour before the interview, Brown's assistant informed \"CBS Mornings\" that the cast member wouldn't be joining the on-set interview due to mental health concerns and, in part, because he was worried about being bullied.",
      "In a statement released to \"CBS Mornings\" explaining his absence, Brown said, \"Thank you to everyone around the world for welcoming me into their homes for 10 seasons. Season 10 is amazing and I know you will fall in love with the deserving people we helped.\"",
      "It continued, \"Though the show is ending, I hope everyone remembers the main theme I have tried to teach them over the past decade, which is to focus on and to protect their mental health/peace from people or a world who seek to destroy it; which is why I can't be there today. Thank you to the crew for being the best in business and the executives for believing in me. 10 Seasons, I'm truly humbled.\"",
      "Brown is part of the Fab Five, which includes Tan France, Jonathan Van Ness, Antoni Porowski and Jeremiah Brent, who joined the cast on season nine of the show. Brent replaced interior designer Bobby Berk, who left the show after eight seasons.",
      "\"Queer Eye\" cast addresses Brown's absence",
      "Porowski said \"surprise is a fair understatement,\" referring to Brown's absence after listening to \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King read his statement.",
      "\"I will say our 'Queer Eye' family, we have been doing this for almost a decade, which is pretty wild to believe, and families are complicated. We're definitely not excluded from that,\" Porowski said.",
      "Van Ness said he's honored to have learned from Brown during their time together on the show.",
      "\"He has taught people to center what they need and I'm actually really proud of him. Center what you need. Do the things you need to take care of you. I'd be lying if I didn't feel like that sometimes,\" Van Ness said. \"And so, I think it's really beautiful, and I think we do need to center what is best for us sometimes and my hat off to him for doing that today.\"",
      "Brent called his experience with the group transformative, saying, \"I have felt safe and supported by the people up here. I have loved every second of this thing and I'm so excited that we get to do this and share this next season because the show really is just about highlighting the best of humanity.\"",
      "10th and final season",
      "In the very first episode of the series, France said they were working toward acceptance, but as the show comes to a close, he revealed he isn't sure that's happened yet.",
      "\"I would love to believe that we have come around to that, but as we've seen, especially over the last year or so, that hasn't been the case here in particular in the U.S. I pray we will continue to fight for acceptance but it is not just ours,\" France said. \"It is our entire nation's responsibility at this point to fight for those who can't fight for themselves.\"",
      "But the cast members agreed the show has had a massive impact on their lives.",
      "\"It has really given me hope for what this country has been and can be again,\" France said. \"It helps me to understand the way our country operates through the heroes that we've helped.\"",
      "\"It's just opened my eyes to so much,\" Van Ness added, reflecting on his time on the series. \"At the end of the day people want to be safe. They want to be loved and accepted by their family. Sometimes that's not possible so they have a chosen family around them. I think we are so much more similar than we are different.\"",
      "For Porowski, \"Queer Eye\" has changed him as a person as he looks at future projects.",
      "\"I think it has for all us in how we want to, the type of stories that we want to tell and even more importantly, other people, hopefully it inspires them to kind of push towards embracing diversity,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The publisher of the Daily Mail tabloid denies claims by Prince Harry and other celebrities of \"unlawful information gathering.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Prince Harry was back in London on Monday, sitting in the U.K.'s highest court to take part in the third and final of his outstanding legal battles against Britain's tabloid newspapers.",
      "Harry is among the high-profile claimants, along with Sir Elton John and actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, who have accused the Associated Newspapers group of \"unlawful information gathering.\"",
      "The 41-year-old royal, who lives in California, and his fellow celebrities claim the company, which publishes the Daily Mail and the linked MailOnline website, illegally snooped on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records to generate scoops.",
      "The publisher has denied all of the accusations, calling them \"preposterous smears\" and part of a coordinated effort driven by the claimants' personal dislike of the news media.",
      "In a witness submission seen by CBS News, Harry said it was, \"disturbing to feel that my every move, thought or feeling was being tracked and monitored just for the Mail to make money out of it,\" adding that the \"terrifying\" intrusion made him, \"paranoid beyond belief, isolating me.\"",
      "Harry, the Duke of Sussex, whose case is based on 14 separate newspaper stories, says the alleged illegal information gathering between 1993 and 2011 put a \"massive strain\" on his personal relationships. He has long blamed the media for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 as her vehicle was pursued by photographers on motorcycles.",
      "He listened in court Monday as his lawyer argued that there was, \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering at both the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.\"",
      "Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, will be used in the trial. CBS News' partner network BBC news reported Monday that Harry was expected to take the stand himself to offer evidence.",
      "During his first legal battle with the press, in 2019, against the owners of The Mirror for hacking his phone, Harry became the first senior member of the royal family to give in-person testimony in a British court in more than 130 years. Courts ruled in his favor multiple times in that case.",
      "\"The journalists who used me and the editors who sanctioned this knew full well that I was a practitioner of the 'Dark Arts,'\" private investigator Steve Whittamore said in a witness statement ahead of the trial that began Monday. \"If the information the journalists requested could have been acquired legitimately \u2026 then the newspapers would have had no need to use my particular services.\"",
      "Another witness, known as \"Detective Danno,\" claims to have been paid the equivalent of more than $1 million by the Mail for over 20 years of work for the paper.",
      "The publisher has argued that evidence from private detectives can't be trusted.",
      "Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, said Monday that Prince William appeared to be \"full of confidence\" about his case, but \"he's not really relishing the prospect of being in court all week.\"",
      "Last year, Rupert Murdoch's right-leaning News Group Newspapers settled out of court with the royal, offering a full formal apology for \"serious intrusion\" and a multi-million dollar payout.",
      "The case against Associated Newspapers is expected to last nine weeks, culminating with a decision by Judge Matthew Nicklin, whose verdict will determine not only the lasting reputation of a major media company, but also who foots the bill for tens of millions of dollars in legal costs.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Nikkhah told CBS News. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:11:15 -0500",
    "summary": "As a young boy, Judd Apatow says he wanted to grow up to be like the director of such classics as \"Blazing Saddles\" and \"Young Frankenstein.\" Now Apatow has co-directed a two-part HBO Max documentary about his idol: \"Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man!\"",
    "story": [
      "At the Golden Globes last week, Judd Apatow cracked up the room: \"I'm very honored to be asked to present the award for best director, because I'm pretty sure that means the Globes people think I'm also one of the best directors.\"",
      "But Apatow is more at home behind the camera, as a director of comedies like \"The 40 Year Old Virgin,\" and of documentaries about some of his idols, like comedians Garry Shandling and George Carlin.",
      "His latest subject hardly needs an introduction.",
      "Asked why he decided to do a documentary about Mel Brooks, Apatow said, \"Mel is the reason why most of us went into comedy. You know, when I was a kid (I was born in 1967), all these Mel Brooks movies came out while I was a little kid and trying to figure out what the world meant and who I was. And here was this hilarious, tiny Jewish man who was really loud and brash and confident, and seemed like the coolest guy in the world. And I think me and a lot of people thought, 'Oh, that's the job you would want. You would want to be Mel Brooks.'\"",
      "\"Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man\" streams this week on HBO Max. Co-directed by Michael Bonfiglio, it's the surprisingly personal origin story of a comedy legend \u2013 a Brooklyn kid raised by a single mom whose four sons went off to war.",
      "In the documentary, Brooks described his wartime experience:",
      "Brooks: \"I was sent from a provincial tenement in Brooklyn to France, 1104th engineer combat battalion.\"Apatow: \"And the Germans had just left France?\"Brooks: \"Yeah.\"Apatow: \"And so your job was to make sure they didn't leave behind booby traps?\"Brooks\" \"Right. Forty-five degree angle with your bayonet, go through the soil, find, find, find, dink dink. Oh, oh!\"",
      "\"I said to him, you know, \"Did you ever think that you were gonna die?'\" Apatow recalled. \"And he goes, 'Only every second of every day.'\"",
      "Brooks came home from the war, but he never really stopped fighting the Nazis \u2013 lampooning them in \"The Producers,\" \"To Be or Not to Be,\" and \"History of the World Part I.\"",
      "Asked what made Nazis such a frequent target of Brooks, Apatow said, \"The fear that it was gonna happen again. And then if you don't keep pointing out how horrifying this is, then it can, you know, slowly bubble back up, which is something we see right now.\"",
      "And Brooks was equally fearless against racism. His 1974 film \"Blazing Saddles\" is the story of a Black sheriff in a racist town. Critics were divided over the raunchy comedy, but it was a monster hit with moviegoers. And just a few months later, he came out with another monster hit, \"Young Frankenstein.\"",
      "What did releasing two big hits in the same year do for Brooks' status? \"He just became Beyonc\u00e9 for a little while,\" Apatow said. \"I mean, he was a real sensation. And it was kind of shocking, right, that two of the best comedies of all time come out in the same year. And we didn't talk about this in the documentary, but there was some sense that 'Blazing Saddles' was so daring that maybe he made sure to make another movie, so that if they really turned on him with 'Blazing Saddles,' he already had another one to show 'em.\"",
      "It wasn't all just for laughs:\u00a0 Mel Brooks also produced dramas, like David Lynch's \"The Elephant Man,\" but he did it quietly, refusing to put his name on it. \"He thought it was a distraction, and you would think the movie was silly 'cause his name was on it,\" Apatow said. \"But yet, it said Brooksfilms. So, I think people figured it out. I think he should put his name on there.\"",
      "No history of Mel Brooks' life would be complete without a mention of his best friend, comedy giant Carl Reiner. \"It's one of the great friendships of all time, because they were friends for, I mean, 70 years? Maybe more?\" Apatow said. \"You know, some people are just magic together. They just fit. And they adored each other more than I've ever seen two people adore and respect each other. I asked him, you know, 'What is the core of this?' And he said, 'He's my father.'\"",
      "Reiner was actually only four years older, but Brooks looked up to him, and later in life, as widowers, they leaned on one another. [Brooks' wife, Anne Bancroft, died in 2005; Estelle Reiner died in 2008.]",
      "Apatow said the loss of Bancroft was very hard on Brooks: \"He famously would go eat dinner and watch a movie with Carl Reiner at Carl Reiner's house, and he did that for many, many years. And they supported each other. And that's how both of them got through it. And then after Carl died, Mel would go to Carl's house alone and eat dinner and watch a movie. And I asked him why. And he said, 'Because it feels like he's there in some way.'\"",
      "Brooks, who will turn 100 in June, has two Oscars, four Emmys, and the Broadway version of his hit movie \"The Producers\" has 12 Tonys \u2013 a record that still stands today. He also won three Grammys, giving him rare EGOT status.",
      "What's more, he's lived long enough to see how his work endures, in his films, and in the countless comedians he inspired.",
      "Asked what Brooks thought his legacy was, Apatow replied, \"He said he thought he was put on this Earth to make people laugh, and he did that.\"",
      "\"What do you think Mel Brooks' legacy is?\" I asked.",
      "\"The main one is probably the funniest person of all time, and the creator of some of the best films of all time, one of the great Broadway musicals of all time, who had the courage to make comedy, both about unimportant things and the most important things, and he did it longer than anybody,\" Apatow said.",

    "story": [
      "Bank of America is weighing whether to launch a new credit card that would comply with President Trump's push to temporarily cap card\u00a0interest rates at 10%, according to a person familiar with the financial giant's plans.",
      "Bank of America already offers credit cards with initial average percentage rates below 10%. For example, its no-frills BankAmericard offers consumers a 0% introductory APR for 18 months. Once that period ends, however, the APR rises to between 14.5% and 24%, depending on the cardholder's credit score.",
      "In a social media post, Mr. Trump earlier this month called for a 10% cap on credit card rates for one year, accusing credit card issuers of having \"ripped off\" consumers for years by charging interest rates of up to 30% for customers carrying balances.",
      "But the Trump administration has yet to provide more details on the proposal, including how it would be enforced, leaving banking executives unclear on what compliance with such an interest rate limit would entail.",
      "Credit card debt has been rising for decades, ebbing after the 2008 financial crisis and later during the COVID-19 pandemic, only to swell to a record high last year. As of the third quarter of 2025, Americans had outstanding credit card balances of $1.2 trillion, up nearly 6% from a year ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",

      "The banking industry has criticized Mr. Trump's proposed cap, saying it could hurt consumers by reducing their access to credit and steering them toward riskier lending products. Reduced consumer spending would cut into economic growth, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"We believe Treasury Secretary [Scott] Bessent understands how this could limit credit card lending and expose banks to risk.

    "summary": "Only one in four Americans has a credit score above 800, which is considered exceptional, according to industry data.",
    "story": [
      "Achieving a credit score of 800 or higher can help unlock the lowest interest rates for products ranging from auto loans to credit cards, but only one in four Americans has managed to reach that level, according to credit bureau Experian.",
      "Lenders typically view scores above 800 as \"exceptional,\" a signal that a borrower consistently pays bills on time and manages debt responsibly. Most banks rely on the FICO score, developed by Fair Isaac Corp., which ranges from 300 to a maximum of 850, to assess a consumer's creditworthiness.",
      "Hitting that 800-point milestone may be more critical in 2026 than ever before.",
      "The new urgency stems from President Trump's recent push for a 10%\u00a0cap on credit card interest rates. While the proposal aims to save consumers money, industry trade groups such as the Electronic Payments Coalition warn that a cap could lead lenders to reduce credit limits or even cancel cards for borrowers with credit scores below 740.",
      "\"Credit scores are really far-reaching in our financial lives. It's a part of the puzzle a lender uses to determine whether or not to lend to you, whether it's a credit card, personal loan, mortgage or beyond,\" \u00a0Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, a personal finance firm that offers free credit scores, told CBS News.",
      "She added, \"Anyone applying for credit should take every step they can to improve their score to get the lowest interest rates from lenders.\"",
      "What's a good credit score?",
      "Here's the range of credit scores and the share of consumers in each tranche, according to credit bureau Experian:",
      "Poor (300-579): 14.2%Fair (580-669): 14.9%Good (670-739): 20.4%Very good (740-799): 27.5%Exceptional (800-850): 23%",

      "Good (670-739): 20.4%",
      "Very good (740-799): 27.5%",
      "Exceptional (800-850): 23%",
      "Only 2% of Americans have achieved the top FICO score of 850, Experian says. But you don't need to have a perfect score to get better rates from lenders, financial experts note.",
      "A credit score in the high 600s or above 700 is considered good, according to Matt Schulz, a personal finance expert at online lending marketplace LendingTree.",
      "\"The higher you can get above 700, the better you are,\" he said.",
      "Cynthia Chen, CEO of Kikoff, a financial technology company that helps people build credit, said that any score above 760 can unlock access to the best credit products.",
      "How can I boost my score to 800?",
      "According to Experian, your FICO score is determined by five key factors, each carrying a different weight:",
      "Payment history: 35%Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%Length of credit history: 15%Credit mix: 10%Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Payment history: 35%",
      "Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%",
      "Length of credit history: 15%",
      "Credit mix: 10%",
      "Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Because payment history is the most impactful of these factors, accounting for 35% of your total credit score, experts emphasize that consistently paying accounts on time is the single most important step you can take.",
      "Indeed, a single late payment to your credit card issuer could knock off 50 or more points from your credit score, according to Schulz.",
      "To avoid making any late payments, Schulz and other experts recommend automating bill payment, although they stress that it's still important to monitor bills for mistakes and to ensure that the payments are actually made.",
      "\"That takes some pressure off of you,\" Schulz said.",
      "Keep your balance low",
      "If you can't pay your bill in full when it comes due, try to keep the balance, or your credit utilization rate, as low as possible.",
      "Your utilization rate measures how much of your available credit you've used. For example, if you made a $1,500 purchase with a $2,000 credit limit, your credit utilization rate would be quite high, at 75%. High credit utilization can take points off your score because lenders could see it as a signal of financial risk.",
      "\"Just because you can borrow up to a certain amount doesn't mean you should. When it comes to credit cards, you should only be borrowing what you can pay off in full at the end of the month,\" financial consultant Steve Azoury, owner of Michigan-based Azoury Financial, told CBS News.",
      "According to\u00a0Experian, people with exceptional credit scores, in the 800 to 850 range, have an average credit utilization rate of just over 7%.",
      "Alev of Credit Karma encourages consumers to aim to keep their rates below 10%. People with utilization rates above 30% can see \"meaningful negative implications\" on their credit scores, she said.",
      "While keeping your credit utilization low won't guarantee a top credit score, it is one of the most heavily weighted components.",
      "Limit applications for credit",
      "Avoid applying for too much credit, too often. Whenever you apply for new credit, a lender pulls your credit file or runs a so-called hard inquiry on your credit report, which affects your score.",
      "Each hard inquiry can knock off roughly five points from your credit score, meaning that multiple inquiries in a short period of time can have a large impact, according to Experian.",
      "Build a credit history",
      "The length of consumers' credit histories factors into their FICO scores, too. More than half of the people with 800-plus credit scores are older than 60, according to Experian, in part because they have established long track records of paying their bills on time.",
      "One way for a relatively new account holder to quickly build a credit history and demonstrate consistent payment behavior is to set recurring subscriptions, such as streaming plans or gym memberships, to autopay.",
      "\"If you pay it every single month, that builds payment history. You don't need to put a lot of charges on a card, but you need to show that behavior of consistent, on-time payments,\" Alev told CBS News.",
      "Kikoff's Chen said that consumers with only a few months of credit history should not expect to achieve a score of 800 or above right away, as all borrowers start with relatively low scores that take time to build.",
      "\"Scoring models want you to demonstrate your creditworthiness over the long term,\" she said. \"They need history to get to that level of comfort.\"",
      "Mix up your credit types",
      "Managing a variety of credit types, such as credit cards, auto loans and mortgages, can help boost your credit score.",
      "\"Credit mix is important because a lender wants to know how you do with different types of credit, and not just a personal loan or a credit card,\" Chen of Kikoff said. \"If you have a mortgage or an auto loan, the credit scoring model gives you points for that.\"",

    "story": [
      "The typical American family earns far too little to comfortably afford child care, according to a new analysis.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) considers child care affordable when households spend no more than 7% of their total annual income on such services. By that measure, households need an income of nearly $403,000 to cover the cost of care for two children, LendingTree, an online loan marketplace, estimates.",
      "As of 2024 (the last year for which data is available), the median annual family income in the U.S. was\u00a0$105,800, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "Families with two children spend an average of $2,252 per month for full-time child care \u2014 more than the cost of rent in dozens of the country's largest cities, according to other LendingTree\u00a0figures.",
      "\"Child care costs are just incredibly daunting for all but the wealthiest Americans,\" Matt Schulz, a chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, told CBS News. \"It forces parents into some really tough choices, including whether to have kids or not.\"",
      "Schulz said the report makes clear that limiting child care costs to 7% of your income \"just isn't realistic anymore.\" Federal labor\u00a0data\u00a0shows that families spend between 8.9% and 16% of their median income on full-time care for one child in 2022 (the latest data available).",
      "The rising cost of child care has become a focal point for lawmakers and policymakers amid public concerns about affordability, while some leaders are taking action. In New York City, Mayor Zohran Mamdani and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul earlier this month announced a plan for free child care for 2-year-olds, part of Mamdani's\u00a0broader push to bring universal child care to New York City.",
      "Other states, including Kentucky, have also made a push for universal Pre-K, with officials framing it as a boon for education and for families.",
      "Given spiraling child care costs, Schulz said it's crucial for parents to start putting away money for these expenses as soon as possible.",
      "\"It has always been expensive to raise kids, but today's costs are just so huge that it takes things to another level,\" he said.",

    "summary": "A year ago, a law that effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. went into effect, though President Trump has not enforced it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, the platform announced the formation of a new U.S.-based entity to comply with the statute.",
      "TikTok\u00a0confirmed Thursday\u00a0that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0late Thursday.",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "\"The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "China and the U.S. both signed off on the deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms, keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "A source familiar with the deal told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance led the administration's efforts to prevent TikTok from going dark in the U.S. Vance, according to the source, encouraged Google and Apple to restore TikTok to their app stores. The app was not available in app stores for about a month after the law took effect.",
      "Vance also spoke regularly with ByteDance, both the vice president and Mr. Trump joined some of the negotiations by phone, the source said.",
      "The source added that China was threatened with serious consequences if a deal did not materialize by the end of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Madrid in September.",
      "\"With this new entity under the control of U.S. investors, Americans can continue to enjoy TikTok safely and securely with their data protected in the United States,\" a spokesperson for Vance told CBS News.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who recently became the top Democrat on the China committee, said the deal is \"causing uncertainty among many creators.\" Khanna previously tried to repeal the law, citing concerns about its effects on free speech and the livelihoods of creators.",
      "\"I will be engaging with Americans and small business owners who depend on the app to find the best way forward and to prevent changes that could disrupt the rapidly growing creator economy while prioritizing data security,\" Khanna said in a statement.",

      "Tesla cited \"uncertainty from shifting trade, tariff and fiscal policy\" as some of the headwinds it was facing in a presentation\u00a0last year. The company remains the dominant seller of electric vehicles in the U.S., accounting for around 46% in 2025.",
      "\"It's been an uphill battle for sales, but a long demand curve ahead,\" said tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In January, the company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Tesla has been eclipsed by China's BYD as the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla isn't the only EV maker to see weaker sales. Across the auto industry, electric vehicle sales last year totaled roughly 1.3 million, a 2% drop from 2024.",
      "One obstacle is affordability, given that electric cars remain generally pricier than gas-powered vehicles. As of November, the average price of a new EV was $58,638, versus less than $50,000 for conventional cars,\u00a0according to Cox Automotive.",
      "The tax and spending bill passed by Congress last year also eliminated tax credits for both new and used EVs, which critics warned could make the cars unaffordable for many people.",
      "Multiple recalls",
      "Tesla launched the futuristic-looking steel Cybertruck in 2023 at a starting price of $60,990. At the time, Tesla CEO Elon Musk touted them as the strongest pickup truck on the road, able to tow 11,000 pounds.",
      "However, the trucks have faced a rash of mechanical and other problems. Last year, Tesla recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks over an issue with the trim panel, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said could detach from the vehicle and pose a risk to other drivers.",
      "The vehicle has also faced recalls for issues with its rearview camera, windshield wipers and\u00a0accelerator pedals.",
      "Cybertrucks also became a flashpoint in the debate over Musk's role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. In a sign of protest,\u00a0some people vandalized Cybertrucks at Tesla dealerships.",
      "Catalysts for growth",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock price has performed well, rising rougly 9% to $450.39 over the last 12 months. Ives expects the carmaker's strength in self-driving technology and so-called robotaxis to drive growth.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts also have high hopes for a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, that Tesla is developing and expects to roll out commercially over the next year. Speaking at the annual World Economic Forum event in Davos, Switzerland, Musk said Thursday that Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks\" at Tesla plants.",

      "With temperatures plunging in some states as a\u00a0massive winter storm bears down across the U.S., some electric vehicle owners could face a cold, hard truth: EVs can lose efficiency in low temperatures, curtailing their driving ranges.",
      "The issue drew widespread attention in January 2024, when some Chicago-area Tesla owners found their EVs' batteries had died in subzero temperatures. Other EV owners have posted online about their vehicles' shorter ranges in winter.",
      "Cold weather can slow an EV battery's chemical and physical reactions, reducing vehicle power. And unlike conventional cars with an internal combustion engine, an EV can't tap its motor's heat to warm the interior. Instead, EVs must tap their batteries to provide cabin heat, which can sap their range, according to Consumer Reports.",
      "At 16 degrees Fahrenheit, EVs lose about 25% of their range when driving at about 70 mph, versus their range when driving at the same speed in mid-60-degree temperatures, Consumer Reports found in road testing.",
      "EV owners could be tested this weekend as extreme cold temperatures spread across the U.S., along with freezing rain, snow and rain. Thermometers in the\u00a0Minneapolis area\u00a0plunged to 21 degrees below zero on Friday morning, with wind chills making it feel even colder.",

      "Are newer EVs better at handling the cold?",
      "Car manufacturers have made some changes that mean newer EVs perform better in cold temperatures, according to the Zero Emission Transportation Association, or ZETA, an industry trade group.",
      "Newer EVs have heat pumps and better battery encasements that can help improve battery efficiency, ZETA noted. South Korean automaker Kia says that its new EV models include advanced heat pumps, which extract heat from the outside air, even in cold weather, and transfer it to the cabin, leaving the EV with more energy available for driving.",

      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

      "President Trump sued JPMorgan Chase Bank and its CEO Jamie Dimon for $5 billion in Florida, Thursday, alleging that the bank had closed his accounts in 2021 \"as a result of political and social motivations.\"",
      "The suit, filed in Florida state court in Miami-Dade County, claims that Mr. Trump and his hospitality companies \"suffered considerable financial harm and losses\" in early 2021 when he and his companies were debanked, because of what the suit called JPMorgan Chase's \"woke beliefs.\" Debanking occurs when financial institutions refuse to work with individuals or businesses or abruptly close clients' accounts.",
      "One of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers, Alejandro Brito, alleged the debanking had a \"devastating impact\" on the ability of Mr. Trump and his businesses to transact and access assets, and caused \"extensive reputational harm by being forced to reach out to other financial institutions in an effort to move their funds and accounts, making it clear that they had been debanked by JPMC.\" The president's companies were given notice in February 2021 they should take their business elsewhere, the lawsuit says.",
      "The suit also alleges that Mr. Trump, his family, and businesses were blacklisted by the bank. It claims JPMorgan Chase urged other financial institutions \"to not carry on business relationships,\" with them, forcing the Trumps and their businesses to accept a \"limited menu of options and less advantageous terms\" at other banks.",
      "JPMorgan Chase said the suit is meritless.",
      "\"While we regret President Trump has sued us, we believe the suit has no merit,\" a spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said in a statement. \"We respect the president's right to sue us and our right to defend ourselves \u2014 that's what courts are for.\"",
      "\"JPMC does not close accounts for political or religious reasons,\" the bank added. \"We do close accounts because they create legal or regulatory risk for the company. We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so. We have been asking both this administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the administration's efforts to prevent the weaponization of the banking sector.\"",
      "The suit was filed the same day the president left the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where Dimon also spoke.",
      "Mr. Trump raised the threat of a lawsuit over the weekend. On Saturday, he said in a post on Truth Social, \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Mr. Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"",
      "Debanking has been a focus for the administration for months. In August, the president signed an executive order that alleged that \"financial institutions have engaged in unacceptable practices to restrict law-abiding individuals' and businesses' access to financial services on the basis of political or religious beliefs or lawful business activities.\" It also directed the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to investigate the matter.",
      "The OCC's preliminary report, issued in December, said it had found early evidence that nine of the biggest U.S. banks \u2014 including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America \u2014 had improperly refused to do business with a range of industries. The six-page report did not identify clients who had been debanked or the institutions alleged to have engaged in the practice.",
      "\"While the OCC is releasing preliminary findings, its work continues to better understand the full extent and effect of these actions and their impact on affected industries and the American economy,\" the comptroller of the currency said in a statement. \"The OCC is also still reviewing thousands of complaints to identify instances of political and religious debanking, which it will report on in due course and as appropriate.\"",

    "summary": "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicts that first-quarter economic growth will heat up to 5%. But sustaining that pace won't be easy, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "Senior Trump administration officials are forecasting a boom for the U.S. economy in 2026, driven by Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and historically large tax refunds.",
      "\"This quarter \u2014 the first quarter of 2026 \u2014 the United States of America's $30 trillion economy will exceed 5% growth,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Fox Business on Wednesday, speaking from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. By the end of 2026, he added, \"You're going to see 6% growth from the United States of America.\"",
      "That would mark the fastest economic growth since late 2021, when the economy grew at a blistering 7% annual pace after many businesses started reopening during the pandemic. Outside of a few post-pandemic statistical outliers, economic activity in the U.S. has historically moved at a far more measured pace, typically averaging between 2% and 3% per quarter on an annualized basis.",
      "As outlined by Lutnick, the U.S. economy could get a lift this year if President Trump appoints a new Federal Reserve chair more inclined to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate, a move that could spur growth. Consumers could also have more money in their pockets from larger tax refunds under the Republicans' tax and spending law, dubbed the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"It's possible \u2014 I would say it's even likely on a one-off basis,\" Mike Skordeles, head of U.S. economics at financial services company Truist, told CBS News of Mr. Lutnick's forecast. But he added that maintaining that growth for a full year is \"a really tough hill to climb.\"",
      "That's because a number of economic headwinds are likely to persist into 2026 and could blunt any lift from lower borrowing costs and larger tax refunds, Skordeles said. Those include trade tensions stemming from Mr. Trump's tariffs, as well as business uncertainty driven by the administration's shifting economic policies.",
      "\"Those are not positives for the economy,\" Skordeles told CBS News. \"One of those reasons why we're not growing faster is uncertainty.\"",
      "Truist forecasts 2.3% economic growth for all of 2026, while projections by other Wall Street economists range from 2% to 2.5%.",
      "A White House official pointed out that Lutnick's forecast is in line with the Atlanta Fed's forecast for fourth-quarter GDP growth of 5.4%.",
      "Risk of overheating",
      "The latest readings on the U.S. economy show a jump in growth, with third-quarter GDP expanding at a 4.3% annualized rate, according to recent government data.",
      "On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the economy is \"likely accelerating,\" citing an\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's GDPNow tool that pegs fourth-quarter GDP growth at 5.4%. The Commerce Department will announce fourth-quarter growth data on Feb. 20.",
      "Yet there are risks to boosting the economy through interest-rate cuts and bigger tax refunds. Those same catalysts contributed to the searing inflation that drove the Consumer Price Index to a 40-year high in 2022.",
      "\"What the secretary was intimating earlier today, to me, that doesn't unlock a bunch of growth \u2014 it unlocks a bunch of inflation,\" Liz Pancotti, managing director of policy and advocacy at Groundworks, a liberal-leaning think tank.",
      "Inflation still isn't down to the Federal Reserve's goal of a 2% annual rate, with the December CPI showing that prices rose at a 2.7% annualized rate. Food prices remain elevated, rising at an annual pace of 3.1% last month due to sharply higher costs of staples like beef and coffee.",
      "\"It's not a single silver bullet that if we just lowered the [Fed's interest] rate, it would make everything magically better,\" Skordeles said. \"You start giving these tax incentives, and you put more money in people's pockets \u2014 it's the classic 'too many dollars chasing too few goods'.\"",
      "Would workers benefit?",
      "Consumers remain generally dour about the U.S. economy, with recent CBS News polling finding that Americans want Mr. Trump to focus more on lowering prices.",
      "\"Lower-income households have experienced weaker wage growth in 2025, while inflation has steadily eroded their checking and savings balances,\" analysts with PNC Economics Research said in a report this week.",
      "While a stronger economy can translate into higher wages in many industries, workers are taking home a smaller slice of the economic pie. The labor share of the nation's GDP slid to its lowest point since 1947, dropping to 53.8% in the third quarter of 2025, according to Bloomberg News.",
      "Even sharply higher economic growth might not do much to assuage public frustration with the cost of food, rent and other affordability issues, Pancotti said, pointing to the example of the strong post-pandemic growth under President Joe Biden. While GDP grew at a 7% pace for two quarters in 2021, Americans were more focused on pocketbook issues such as higher grocery and housing costs, she added.",

    "summary": "President Trump said his plans for boosting home affordability are already helping, but stopped short of providing details.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, that he will promote homeownership in the U.S. by pushing for lower mortgage rates, restricting institutional investors from hoarding residential real estate and capping credit card costs.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Mr. Trump described homeownership as \"a symbol of health and vigor,\" while touting his\u00a0executive order\u00a0this week aimed at deterring Wall Street firms from competing with Americans for homes.",
      "Yet he stopped short of providing details of how such a ban would work, and housing experts said such measures fail to address some of the key drivers behind rising home prices.",
      "\"It's just not fair\"",
      "In his speech at the annual gathering of world leaders, policymakers and business figures, Mr. Trump blamed institutional investors for driving up home prices for Americans by purchasing hundreds of thousands of properties for investment purposes. x",
      "\"Homes are built for people, not for corporations,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's just not fair to the public. They are not able to buy a house.\"",
      "His proposed ban would restrict future purchases of single-family homes by major housing investors, such as hedge funds and real estate investment trusts, but would not force them to sell properties they already own. The plan would require approval by Congress before taking effect.",
      "But Jina Yoon, chief alternative investment strategist at LPL Financial, noted that the proposal only applies to existing houses and excludes newly built homes, potentially allowing some firms to continue scooping up properties.",
      "\"This allows institutional investors to shift their capital to build-to-rent projects, which could actually accelerate more rental community development owned and managed by large institutional investors,\" she said in an email. \"And there are many more structural factors that drive home prices and affordability issues than the share of homes owned by institutional investors, such as chronic supply shortages, zoning constraints, income and mortgage costs.\"",
      "Across the U.S., big investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Yet research from the Government Accountability Office\u00a0shows\u00a0that even modest levels of institutional investment in the local housing markets can drive up home prices, especially in communities with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Shamus Roller, executive director of the nonprofit National Housing Law Project, said the plans released so far by the Trump administration to address home affordability fail to account for the complexities of the housing market.",
      "\"Given how big an issue this is across the country, it deserves more attention and thought than what has been provided,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Specifically, Roller highlighted the shortage of available homes for sale, saying that new U.S. tariffs on imported homebuilding materials have raised costs and that the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration has led to worker shortages among construction companies.",
      "Analysts with Oxford Economics said that Mr. Trump's fixes could, in fact, boost demand for homes, but appear to do little to boost supplies, which they say is essential to addressing the affordability problem.",
      "\"A persistent shortage of housing units is a key driver of elevated housing costs,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, U.S. lead economist with Oxford, said in a report.",
      "Falling mortgage rates",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said his policies for easing home prices are already bearing fruit, pointing to mortgage rates this month falling to a three-year low after he directed the federal government to buy $200 billion worth of mortgage securities.",
      "The president also said he could take other steps to reduce the cost of home loans, but added that he doesn't plan to do so because he wants to protect existing homeowners.",
      "\"If I wanted to really crush the housing market, I could do that so fast people would buy houses,\" he said.",
      "The recent drop in mortgage rates to just over 6% has spurred more home buying and refinancing activity, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that the government buying $200 billion in mortgage securities would drive home loan costs down by 0.15%.",
      "\"While any decline in mortgage rates is helpful for affordability, the standalone impact of this move on our numbers is small,\" analysts with the investment bank said in a report.",
      "A dip in mortgage rates also risks pushing up home prices as more buyers enter the market, according to housing experts.",
      "Credit card interest rate cap",
      "President Trump said another administration plan for help struggling Americans regain their financial footing \u2014 capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year \u2014 would also boost housing affordability.",
      "\"This will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" said Mr. Trump, who has said that surging credit card debt impedes many Americans in saving for a down payment.",
      "The banking industry has opposed the cap, saying it would limit consumers' access to credit and steer them toward riskier lending products.",

    "summary": "What's a \"peanut butter\" raise? Here's what it means, and why this is the type of pay hike you should expect this year.",
    "story": [
      "Your 2026 pay raise could be a \"peanut-butter\"-style increase, with new research from compensation expert Payscale finding more than four in 10 companies are opting to give identical, across-the-board hikes rather than merit-based raises.",
      "This year, 44% of companies plan to rely on the peanut-butter approach \u2014 a method of evenly spreading pay hikes across the workforce \u2014 according to a new\u00a0report\u00a0from Payscale.",
      "Some employers are moving away from performance-based pay increases because of concerns that the practice is too subjective and potentially biased, Payscale noted. Spreading pay hikes out evenly across a workforce is also easier from an administrative perspective, which can save companies money.",
      "Pay hikes will hold steady at 3.5% in 2026, unchanged from 2025, the group found. Still, merit-based pay hikes remain the predominant method used by companies, with 48% of organizations saying they plan to rely on performance-based raises, Payscale said.",
      "For a worker earning $65,000, a 3.5% annual raise would amount to an additional $2,275 a year.",
      "There are downsides to peanut-butter raises, as they can discourage some employees from putting in extra effort if they don't expect they'll be rewarded for going the extra mile, Payscale said.",
      "\"With no differentiation based on performance, it's easier to give everyone something. But there is a risk that top performers will feel disadvantaged in that environment,\" Ruth Thomas, chief compensation strategist at Payscale, told CBS News.",
      "She noted that companies that eschew merit-based pay increases can still reward top performers with bonuses or promotions, for example.",
      "\"Base pay is not your only lever, and organizations may look more at bonuses and promotions when base pay budgets are restricted,\" she added.",
      "Peanut-butter raises started gaining traction after the Great Recession as budget-constrained companies turned to the strategy, Thomas said. She added that more companies are once again tightening their budgets.",
      "\"We're now seeing a slow decline in pay increase budgets again, so it's easier to give everyone a relatively flat increase,\" Thomas said.",
      "Small company, big raise",
      "Smaller establishments with fewer than 100 employees are offering higher pay increases \u2014 4% \u2014 compared to their larger counterparts. Businesses with between about 10,000 to 50,000 workers said they plan to hand out 3% raises in 2026, the report found.",
      "\"Smaller employers appear to be using pay more aggressively to compete for talent, while larger organizations face structural and budgetary challenges that limit flexibility,\" the researchers said in the report.",
      "Average raises also vary by industry, with companies that are struggling to find workers often offering higher\u00a0pay hikes, notably in these sectors:",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-10-percent-credit-card-rate-cap-banks-january-20/",
    "published": "Wed, 21 Jan 2026 10:01:30 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year 10% cap on credit card rates starting Jan. 20. Here's what credit card companies are doing.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump had set Jan. 20 as a deadline for credit card companies to lower their interest rates to 10% for one year. Now that the date has arrived, most banks and card issuers have largely kept their rates unchanged, while also pushing back against an idea that they say lacks key policy details necessary for them to comply.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the cap on Jan. 9, giving banks and issuers just 11 days to meet his demand. In his Truth Social post announcing the proposal, he said he wanted to ensure that Americans wouldn't get \"'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration.\"",
      "The interest rate cap has drawn bipartisan support from some lawmakers, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri. If enacted, the proposal could save consumers $100 billion per year in reduced interest payments, but the banking industry warns that it could backfire because issuers would be forced to reduce credit access to millions of consumers.",
      "Credit card rates have been sliding lower during the past year, thanks partly to the Federal Reserve's series of 2025 rate cuts. The average APR stood at 19.7% at the end of December, a full percentage point lower than the record high set in August 2024, according to Bankrate.",
      "And many banks offer zero-percent APR cards, which typically provide cards with no interest for an introductory period of, say, 12 to 15 months. After that period, the cards' APRs can rise to a range of roughly 17% to 27%, depending on a consumer's credit score. Mr. Trump's proposal would cap those rates to 10%, as well as any other card that's currently above that level.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has said Mr. Trump expects credit card companies to comply with the demand.",
      "\"I don't have a specific consequence to outline for you, but certainly this is an expectation and frankly a demand that the president has made,\" she said Jan. 16.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how it will enforce the policy or determine if banks are complying with the new proposed rule.",
      "What do experts say?",
      "Banks and bank lobbyists say they are largely in the dark on how to respond to the proposed cap.",
      "Currently, there's no law or executive order in place mandating that lenders charge no more than 10% interest on credit cards. There's also no generally applicable federal law that limits the interest rate that can be charged by a credit card company, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Experts say that a rate cap would likely require approval from Congress.",
      "Mr. Trump could seek to drum up support around a bipartisan bill, such as this one introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont in 2025, said Brian Shearer, the author of the Vanderbilt University\u00a0analysis\u00a0that found a 10% limit would save consumers $100 billion per year in interest payments.",
      "If that bill became law, Mr. Trump could force banks to comply. But mandating a rate cap through an executive action may not be enforceable, he said.",
      "How are banks responding?",
      "Because a cap on APRs would eat into bank profits, card issuers would be likely to cut off the most vulnerable borrowers from credit, banks and bank lobbyists say.",
      "Two-thirds of credit card users carrying a balance would be likely to see their credit lines reduced or canceled entirely, according to a Jan. 12\u00a0analysis from America's Credit Unions, an industry group representing credit unions. Almost all 47 million Americans with a subprime credit score would lose access to credit, the group found.",
      "By contrast, financial pros predicted the 10% cap would have little effect on higher-income bank customers.",
      "\"Americans who have investments and stable jobs aren't the ones with credit card debt. If you make $100,000, plus you're saving with a 401k, those clients will be largely unimpacted by this,\" Nick Holeman, director of financial planning at wealth advisor firm Betterment.",
      "In a Jan. 12 investor call, JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said the proposed interest rate cap would be bad for consumers and could hurt the economy.",
      "\"Specifically, people will lose access to credit, like on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most, ironically,\" he said. \"And so, that's a pretty severely negative consequence for consumers, and frankly, probably also a negative consequence for the economy as a whole right now.\"",
      "The bank also pointed to products it already offers consumers, including cards that offer customers introductory interest rates of 0% for up to 18 months.",
      "In the meantime, one company is stepping up to offer new credit cards that meet Mr. Trump's proposal. Bilt, a fintech company, said it is\u00a0rolling out new credit cards\u00a0that cap interest rates at 10% for one year.",

Its proprietary awards algorithm analyzed anonymous reviews of U.S.-based employers posted on the site from October 2024 through October 2025.",
      "\"Flexibility is extremely important for employees right now, and that doesn't just mean remote work,\" Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao told CBS News. \"Some companies are willing to be flexible on hours or give more autonomy to workers in terms of how they manage their careers.\"",
      "Still, most American workers are disengaged at work, meaning they're either doing the bare minimum or are resentful or unhappy, Gallup's latest State of the Global Workplace report found. Only 3 in 10 workers are engaged, the lowest level in a decade.",
      "Engaged workers tend to have higher productivity and create better business outcomes, Gallup noted. Workers are checking out amid new pressures in the workplace, from the disruption of artificial intelligence to budget cuts, Gallup said.",

      "This year's rankings added nineteen companies to the list, including Alaska Airlines at No. 38, Bath and Body Works at No. 80, Dutch Bros Coffee at No. 75 and Bank of America at No. 96.",

    "summary": "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he has seen \"no evidence\" of a federal investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minnesota \u2014 Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison accused the Trump administration of turning immigration enforcement into \"politics and retribution,\" describing what he called a \"surge\" of federal agents in the Twin Cities as a constitutional crisis, and said he has seen \"no evidence\" of a federal investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month.",
      "\"In fact, I have evidence to the contrary that the federal government is investigating the death of Renee Good at all,\" Ellison told CBS News in an interview Friday.",
      "He added, \"Todd Blanche, who is the No. 2 at DOJ, said they're not investigating.\"",
      "At the same time, Minnesota authorities, Ellison said, are seeking a \"full, fair and joint investigation.\"",
      "\"In Minnesota, if you are killed \u2014 particularly if you're killed\u2026in connection with an action by an official federal or state, we will investigate your death,\" Ellison said.",
      "The state agency tasked with investigating Good's killing, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, withdrew from a joint investigation with the FBI a day after the shooting. It said in a statement at the time the agency said it had been informed by the U.S. Attorney's Office that \"the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\"",
      "When asked in a Jan. 18 interview with \"Face the Nation\" whether the ICE officer who shot Good was under investigation, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that the department was \"following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE, and under the Department of Homeland Security, and within the administration.\"",
      "Ellison on the apprehension of 5-year-old Liam Ramos by ICE",
      "Ellison strongly disputed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's assertions about 5-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into ICE custody outside his home. Ramos' image has been widely circulated across the news and social media in a photo that shows him wearing a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack. DHS said the boy had been \"abandoned.\"",
      "\"I don't buy that at all. In fact, there are very credible people who know Liam who refute that. I believe them over ICE,\" Ellison said, calling DHS' claim and subsequent treatment of Ramos \"another example of atrocity\" tied to the deportation effort DHS has dubbed \"Operation Metro Surge.\"",
      "Witnesses told CBS News that\u00a0ICE used the boy as bait to lure family members out.",
      "\"That is morally repugnant and nothing the federal government should ever be associated with,\" Ellison said.",
      "Suing to stop DHS' warrantless arrests in Minnesota",
      "Ellison's office and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to stop what they allege are unlawful tactics, framing the surge as a planned deployment targeting Minnesota, not a routine enforcement action. He argued the operation has been fueled by President Trump's anger over losing the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\"Mr. Trump said 'retribution.' He said he won Minnesota three times and that leaders here wrongfully denied him. So he's mad at us,\" Ellison said. Asked whether the ICE operation is about politics, rather than law enforcement, he replied, \"It's 100% about politics and retribution.\"",
      "DHS alleges leaders in Minnesota \"created disorder\" by failing to cooperate with federal law enforcement. Ellison called this \"a false statement\" and said planning for the surge of federal law enforcement had long been underway. He said he believes U.S. officials are shifting their rationale now because public opinion is turning against the operation.",
      "At the center of the lawsuit, Ellison said, are accusations of warrantless arrests without individualized assessment \u2014 including alleged civil immigration arrests without probable cause \u2014 along with racial profiling and what he described as excessive detention.",
      "DHS has claimed that there are a few arrest videos that were taken out of context.",
      "\"Yeah, well, they're going to have to defend their position in court, because that's not true,\" Ellison replied.",
      "If he's successful in obtaining an injunction blocking the DHS operation in Minnesota, it's not clear whether the state could enforce it \u2014 or that it would survive appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Ellison acknowledged that uncertainty but said inaction was not an option.",
      "\"The only alternative is to do nothing and hope for the best,\" he said. \"We have to do all that is in our power to insist that the federal government obey the law.\"",
      "Ellison said the DHS surge is imposing significant costs on state and local governments, with \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" spent daily on crowd control, overtime and emergency response.",
      "He also described a stream of injury complaints tied to pepper spray, tear gas and \"less lethal munitions,\" adding that \"literally dozens every day\" are making reports, while also emphasizing the harms of what he called unlawful detention and imprisonment.",
      "And pressed on whether the state would subpoena federal agents in its civil case to access evidence in the Good case, Ellison said legal and ethical constraints govern the boundary between civil litigation and criminal investigations, but he did not rule it out.",
      "\"We're going to do what is legal and ethical,\" he said.",
      "ICE's new authority to carry out warrantless searches",
      "ICE agents have seen their authority expanded \u2014 a May memo that was recently disclosed by whistleblowers said agents are authorized to use force to enter homes without a judicial warrant. Ellison called the policy \"unconstitutional\" and said he's heard reports it's being used in Minnesota. He signaled the state would challenge such actions.",
      "Cooperation with ICE",
      "DHS has said that Minnesota is not cooperating with ICE detainers \u2014 requests to hold detainees for an additional 48 hours so they can be turned over to ICE custody \u2014 or other requests for assistance. Ellison counters that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility \u2014 not the state's \u2014 and while Minnesota is not a sanctuary state, state laws and court orders sometimes prevent the state from assisting ICE because it cannot hold criminals beyond their sentence.",
      "For instance, he said that if an individual sought by the federal government is arrested for driving under the influence, \"our courts don't have the legal authority to hold them once the court has said they need \u2014 they are to be released.\"",
      "He indicated that the state is following its laws as they're written: \"They're asking us to join them in breaking the law, and we can't do that. We believe in upholding the law.\"",
      "But cooperation with ICE detainers is uneven in Minnesota. In Hennepin County, where Minneapolis is located, the sheriff told CBS News that authorities do not notify ICE when detainees are released back into the community. The Department of Corrections, however, does notify ICE.",
      "DHS says that if every county in the state coordinated with ICE, federal agents could go home and ICE would not continue to conduct raids in Minnesota.",
      "\"They're saying, 'Oh, well, if you only would tell us, do our job for us, then we could go home.' No, you didn't,\" Ellison said. He added, \"ICE needs to do its job that it is paid to do, and it has a massive budget to do.\"",
      "\"Minnesota is not a sanctuary state,\" he told CBS News. \"We don't do the federal government's job, but we don't in any way obstruct them from doing their job.\"",
      "He suggested his state is at the center of a collision between politics and constitutional rights and warned that \"the only way to get along\" with the administration is to \"abandon constitutional rights.\"",
      "\"We must insist upon our First Amendment right to vote for whoever we please and not be persecuted,\" he said. \"We must insist on the Fourth Amendment protection to be free of unreasonable search and seizure.\"",

Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said in a statement.",
      "Indyke, Epstein's lawyer; Khan, his accountant, and Wexner, his billionaire financial client and longtime benefactor, were identified as critical to the investigation by Epstein survivors. Documents released in earlier lawsuits and among the recent U.S. Department of Justice trove show a complex and tangled relationship between Epstein and the three men.",
      "Daniel H. Weiner, an attorney for Indyke and Kahn, said in a statement to CBS News that the two accepted the subpoenas and intend to cooperate with the committee, but added that the allegations in the subpoena are \"false.\"",
      "\"It is worth emphasizing that not a single woman has ever accused either Mr. Indyke or Mr. Kahn of committing sexual abuse or witnessing sexual abuse, nor claimed at any time that she reported to them any allegation of Mr. Epstein's abuse,\" Weiner said in the statement. \"Indyke and Kahn did not socialize with Mr. Epstein, and they have always rejected as categorically false any suggestion that they knowingly facilitated or assisted Mr. Epstein in his sexual abuse or trafficking of women, or that they were aware of Mr. Epstein's actions while they provided legal and accounting services to Mr. Epstein.\"",
      "Indyke first began working with Epstein in 1986 at a small boutique law firm in New York City that handled Epstein's real estate deals. He later claimed Epstein as a mentor and was exclusively employed by Epstein by the 1990s. Indyke helped establish Epstein's corporate and personal base of operations in the U.S. Virgin Islands. He was involved in almost every aspect of Epstein's business and personal affairs and was paid millions of dollars for his services, according to court documents.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0European military veterans, families of the fallen, and politicians have voiced outrage after President Trump claimed the U.S. had \"never needed\" its NATO allies, and that allied troops had stayed \"a little off the front lines\" during the 20-year war in Afghanistan.",
      "\"The only time NATO has ever enacted Article 5 was after the 9-11 terrorist attacks on the United States, and the world rallied to the support of the U.S.,\" Alistair Carns, the U.K. government's Minister of the Armed Forces and a veteran who served five tours in Afghanistan alongside American troops, said in a video posted Friday on social media. \"We shed blood, sweat and tears together, and not everybody came home. These are bonds, I think, forged in fire, protecting U.S. or shared interests, but actually protecting democracy overall.\"",
      "More than 2,200 American troops were killed in Afghanistan, according to the Pentagon. The Reuters news agency says 457 British military personnel, 150 Canadians and 90 French troops died alongside them. Denmark lost 44 troops in Afghanistan \u2014 in per capita terms, about the same death rate as that of the United States.",
      "\"There are two great sayings worth remembering,\" Carns said in his video responding to Mr. Trump's remarks. \"Number one: 'There's only one worse thing than working with allies. That is working without them.' And when you do, always remember: 'Never above, never below, always side-by-side.\"",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Friday that Mr. Trump, \"was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops\" in Afghanistan.",
      "Later Friday, Starmer called the remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling.\"",
      "\"We expect an apology for this statement,\" Roman Polko, a retired Polish general and former special forces commander who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, told the Reuters news agency.",
      "Mr. Trump has \"crossed a red line,\" he said. \"We paid with blood for this alliance. We truly sacrificed our own lives.\"",
      "Lucy Aldridge, the mother of the youngest British soldier killed in Afghanistan, told the BBC she was \"deeply disgusted\" by Mr. Trump's comments. Her son William Aldridge was only 18 years old when he was killed in a 2009 bomb blast, while trying to save fellow troops.",
      "\"Families of those who were lost to that conflict live the trauma every day. I'm not just deeply offended, I'm actually deeply disgusted,\" Aldridge said. \"This isn't just misspeaking, he has deeply offended, I can imagine, every NATO member who sent troops to fight in Afghanistan and certainly the families of those who never came home.\"",
      "The former head of the British Army, Lord Richard Dannatt, called Mr. Trump's comments, \"outrageous.\"",
      "\"Well frankly, one was dumbfounded, because they're [Mr. Trump's comments] so factually incorrect. Absolutely disrespectful to our nation, to our armed forces and to the families of the 457 British service men and women who lost their lives in Afghanistan,\" Dannatt told the BBC.",
      "\"The comments that he made \u2026 are just totally disrespectful, wrong and outrageous. It does make you wonder whether he is actually fit for the job that he apparently is doing,\" Dannatt added.",
      "\"We Europeans must do more, and if there's anything positive that Donald Trump has done in his assorted ramblings over the last year, it's actually to make that point,\" the former U.K. army chief said. \"European governments must really listen up, stand up now and find the cash that's needed to increase our military capability, not because we want to fight a war, but we need to deter further aggression.\"",
      "CBS News asked the White House on Friday about Mr. Trump's remarks on the role America's NATO allies played in the war in Afghanistan, and the criticism directed at him.",
      "Deputy press secretary Anna Kelly replied with the following statement: \"President Trump is right \u2014 America's contributions to NATO dwarf that of other countries, and his success in delivering a five percent spending pledge from NATO allies is helping Europe take greater responsibility for its own defense. The United States is the only NATO partner who can protect Greenland, and the President is advancing NATO interests in doing so.\"",

      "Mergen left the FBI \"in part due to the pressure on her to reclassify/discontinue the (Good) investigation,\" a source with knowledge of her departure told CBS News.",
      "Another FBI source said Mergen \"would not bow to pressure\" from leadership.",
      "Her squad, which also handles civil rights cases, was involved in both the Good investigation and the ongoing probes into public benefits fraud in Minnesota. Mergen's departure was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "CBS News has tried to reach Mergen for comment.",
      "The fatal shooting of Renee Good at the hands of an ICE officer was initially treated as a civil rights investigation, but Justice Department leadership later ordered the FBI and prosecutors to treat it as an assault on a federal officer and instructed them to investigate Good's wife, CBS News previously reported.",
      "FBI spokesman Ben Williamson told CBS News the FBI does not comment on personnel matters. He said in a statement regarding the bureau's probe of the Good shooting, \"The facts on the ground do not support a civil rights investigation. FBI continues to investigate the incident as well as the violent criminal actors and those perpetrating illegal activity.\"",
      "According to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, the FBI's public corruption squad is also under pressure from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's office to investigate campaign finance contributions in connection with Feeding Our Future, the Minnesota nonprofit at the center of what prosecutors have said is the nation's largest COVID-era fraud scheme.",

      "The 5-year-old immigrant boy taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement alongside his father in the Minneapolis area earlier this week has an active and pending case in immigration court and cannot be legally deported yet, according to government records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The ICE operation that led Liam Adrian Conejo Ramos and his father to be taken into government custody, captured on videos and photos that have gone viral, has garnered national attention and raised questions about who exactly the Trump administration is targeting in its mass deportation campaign.",
      "Justice Department records reviewed by CBS News indicate Liam and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Ramos, have immigration court cases listed as \"pending.\" The records by the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review do not list any deportation orders in either case, indicating that an immigration judge still must consider Liam and his father's claims before any deportation attempt. The information says the family's immigration court case was docketed on Dec. 17, 2024.",
      "CBS News was able to review the government information after obtaining the \"alien\" numbers issued to Liam and his father. Those \"A numbers\" are issued by the U.S. government to immigrants, illegal and legal alike, to internally track their deportation cases or immigration applications.",
      "Liam and his father are now being held at the Dilley detention center in Texas, ICE's long-term holding site for families with underage children, according to officials and the agency's detainee tracking system.",
      "Representatives for Liam and his father say the family is from Ecuador and that they entered the U.S. in 2024 to request asylum. The family's lawyer said they were able to get an appointment to enter the U.S. at an official crossing site along the southern border, with the government's permission, through a Biden administration system that relied on a phone app called CBP One. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said Friday the agency has \"no record\" of the family using CBP One.",
      "The Trump administration shut down the CBP One process immediately after taking office, and converted it into a self-deportation app now known as CBP Home. It also revoked the legal protections the Biden administration offered those who entered under the program, targeting some of them for arrest and deportation, including during immigration court appointments in cities across the U.S.",
      "The family's lawyer has said Liam's father does not appear to have a criminal record. DHS has called Liam's father an \"illegal alien\" and accused him of attempting to flee ICE officers, abandoning his son in the process. McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said Liam's father \"committed a federal crime by evading arrest.\"",
      "And while immigrants with pending claims cannot be legally deported, immigration officials do have the authority to detain them, if they're in the U.S. illegally or without a valid legal status, pending the adjudication of those cases.",
      "Prokosh Law LLC, the law firm representing Liam and his father, did not provide further information when asked about the family's immigration case.",
      "\"As their attorney of record, our primary concern at this time is Liam and Adrian's safety, well-being, and the work that is involved in getting them released from detention,\" the law firm told CBS News. \"While we do the relevant work to secure their release, we are unable to provide further information to the press.\"",
      "Dueling narratives about the arrest",
      "During a press conference in Minneapolis on Friday, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, said his officers targeted Liam's father \u2014 not the child \u2014 during an arrest operation on Jan. 20. Charles said Liam was with his father inside a vehicle when ICE officers approached them.",
      "Charles said Liam's father tried to escape on foot, \"abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.\" He said an officer stayed with Liam, while others arrested his father. ICE officers \"cared for\" Liam and took him to a drive-through restaurant, Charles added.",
      "ICE officers tried to get Liam's family to take the child but the \"people inside refused to take him in and open the door,\" according to Charles. He noted his officers were \"heartbroken\" by the incident.",
      "Sergio Amezcua, a pastor who said he's spoken to Liam's mother, noted she \"was terrified\" during the incident.",
      "\"ICE agents were trying to use the baby for her to come out of her house,\" Amezcua said on CNN. \"But the neighbors step[ped] up. Neighbors advised her not to do it.\"",
      "On Friday, Charles said families held by ICE get \"top-notch care\" at facilities like the Dilley center in Texas, calling their treatment \"better than social services.\"",
      "\"They have medical care. The food is good. They have learning services. They have church services available. They have recreation,\" Charles said.",
      "But advocates for immigrants have raised concerns about conditions at the Dilley facility. Neha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law, which represents migrant children in U.S. custody, said minors held at Dilley have experienced \"a dramatic decline in their physical and mental health.\"",
      "\"The current conditions at Dilley are fundamentally unsafe for anyone, let alone young children,\" Desai said. \"Since the re-opening of family detention, hundreds of families \u2014 including babies and toddlers \u2014 have been subjected to substandard medical care, degrading and harsh treatment and extremely prolonged times in custody.\"",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Five months later, in the weeks following the arson attack on the Residence, as I sat in a pew at Salem Baptist Church, I felt a tap on my arm. It was a woman from the congregation who had been sitting in the pew across from me. She was in a baby-pink T-shirt and sweatpants and a matching baseball cap, suited up to join the other church ladies on a fitness walk after the service. She was in her seventies, at least, and greeted me with a smile. \"Governor, I've been praying for you,\" she said. I was touched, of course. \"We will take care of you like you took care of me all those years ago and lifted me up.\"",
      "She had tears in her eyes as she told me that seventeen years ago, when I'd served this district in the state House, we had met at a local event. Her husband had been sick, and she'd been having a hard time. They'd needed help with their medical benefits. I'd heard her, she said. I could see how down and out they had been. I'd told my team that they needed to figure out a way to get them what they needed, and we had. And now, here she was, in this church, at a difficult point in my life and for my family. She was here praying for me, lifting me up. I could feel the power of her prayers. The sense of connectedness to someone I hadn't really seen in many years.",
      "Those days after the attack on the Governor's Residence felt, at times, heavy and unrelenting, like we were wandering through the dark. And yet, as we navigated the challenges and shouldered the weight, what we remember most is not the hardness and the weight. What we carry forward are the moments like this. Because this light, it was all around us. We were overwhelmed by the outpouring from people all across this country whose shared humanity, shared sense of decency, shared agreement of what is right and what is wrong and of what our country should be and who Americans are at our core, overrides all of that.",
      "In days like that morning at Salem, or when I am in a synagogue or any place of worship, which is often in the course of my work, I find myself thinking more and more about William Penn. That he arrived on our shores in October 1682 aboard a ship named Welcome. His Pennsylvania would be a place that would be open to all people, grounded in free expression, freedom of religion, free elections, and respect for others. I think about my responsibility to carry this forward\u2014to go a few more miles in the journey Penn began, to build a place that remains warm and welcoming for everyone\u2014no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, or who you pray to.",
      "Now, I assume Penn could have never imagined a Governor who prays like me or a Lieutenant Governor who looks like Austin [Davius] in the land he once led. Or that he ever would have envisioned a world in which a Jewish Governor would host a giant iftar during Ramadan, obsess about needing more and bigger Christmas trees at the Governor's Residence in December, or host his son's bar mitzvah in the same spot where both of those expressions of other people's faiths took place. Though I do bet he'd be proud of how far we've come.",
      "His ideas of faith and his acceptance of others set in motion something that we need to find our way back to today. It's a foundational principle of this great nation. A band of patriots gathered at Independence Hall in 1776 to declare our independence from a king and set ourselves on a path of self-determination. Those patriots plotted, planned, and organized in taverns and town squares and decided that they wanted to live in a place grounded in the notion of real freedom and self-determination. And over the last two and half centuries, our American story has been defined by people from all walks of life who have followed that lead and done their part. Ordinary Americans rising up, demanding more, seeking justice, and working to build a better life for their children. The story of our nation has not been written just by people with titles next to their names or by people in government offices but by everyday folks believing in each other, standing up, raising their voices, and using their power.",
      "I've been privileged in my life to know those people\u2014the ones who will be in the history books and the ones I've written about in this book. The ones I feel blessed to know because they taught me something and helped me grow as a public servant, as a father, a husband, and a person, and brought me closer to my own faith.",
      "That is the American way. Those are the bonds that lead to a more perfect union. Those people, those bonds, that deeper connection to my faith are how I have learned to fish differently. To show up, to listen, to leave this place better than we found it. That's the cornerstone of my faith\u2014of all faiths, really. It's elemental, even as it is sometimes hard to see and feel today.",
      "This has been true at all the most significant moments in American history\u2014the commitment to doing the hard work required to have faith in these ideals and the people to perfect them. That is our shared story. It was true for our Founders at Independence Hall. It offered courage to the brave souls who wore our uniform and landed on foreign beaches to protect our freedoms here at home and defeat fascism abroad. It was on display when our neighbors, who sought a more perfect union, sat down at the lunch counter so the next generation could stand taller.",
      "I've witnessed this in the many millions of quieter moments of goodness, too. The way my father showed faith that new moms could tell him what they needed for their babies, not the other way around. The way my mother taught me to care about the world around me. In how the survivors of abuse found the courage to expose the truth. I've seen this with the dedication and bravery of the Hawbaker workers who were unafraid of corporate power. And with the law enforcement officers who care so deeply about their neighbors that they're willing to give their lives for the rest of us. I witnessed the fortitude of moms who lost their kids to fentanyl, who turn their pain into help for others; the craftsmen who wouldn't let an arsonist's crimes keep the people's home closed; the brave couples who pushed for marriage equality and moved the needle; the lady at Sheetz who got her husband the care he needed, along with thousands of others in dire straits; a community ravaged by an attack on their neighbors determined to show a capacity to love rather than succumb to hate.",
      "All those people and their actions and their belief in common good have propelled us forward, just like our Founders intended, and helped us find our faith in a brighter, better day. Ordinary folks doing extraordinary things each day to build a more just and connected nation. To not be consumed by darkness or chaos.",
      "Now more than ever, we yearn for and need a world defined by faith. It's universal, this belief in others to help us through what feels unsettled, uncivil, un-American. It's a guidepost, a path through the woods. When the dark feels like it could consume us whole and churn us up and lose us, it is where we keep the light.",

      "President Trump said Thursday an \"armada\" of U.S. warships is headed toward the Middle East, as he continues to watch the Iranian regime's response to massive protests that began in late December.",
      "\"We have a lot of ships going that direction just in case,\" Mr. Trump said when he was asked by reporters on Air Force One where things stand with Iran. He said it was a \"good sign\" Iran had decided not to hang protesters, adding that \"we have an armada heading that direction and maybe we won't have to use it.\"",
      "The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and its escort ships were in the Indian Ocean as of Friday morning, according to defense officials. The carrier strike group brings about 5,000 sailors and Marines with squadrons of fighter jets, helicopters, and electronic attack aircraft.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:16:25 -0500",
    "summary": "A year ago, a law that effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. went into effect, though President Trump has not enforced it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, the platform announced the formation of a new U.S.-based entity to comply with the statute.",
      "TikTok\u00a0confirmed Thursday\u00a0that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0late Thursday.",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "\"The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "China and the U.S. both signed off on the deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms, keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "A source familiar with the deal told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance led the administration's efforts to prevent TikTok from going dark in the U.S. Vance, according to the source, encouraged Google and Apple to restore TikTok to their app stores. The app was not available in app stores for about a month after the law took effect.",
      "Vance also spoke regularly with ByteDance, both the vice president and Mr. Trump joined some of the negotiations by phone, the source said.",
      "The source added that China was threatened with serious consequences if a deal did not materialize by the end of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Madrid in September.",
      "\"With this new entity under the control of U.S. investors, Americans can continue to enjoy TikTok safely and securely with their data protected in the United States,\" a spokesperson for Vance told CBS News.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who recently became the top Democrat on the China committee, said the deal is \"causing uncertainty among many creators.\" Khanna previously tried to repeal the law, citing concerns about its effects on free speech and the livelihoods of creators.",
      "\"I will be engaging with Americans and small business owners who depend on the app to find the best way forward and to prevent changes that could disrupt the rapidly growing creator economy while prioritizing data security,\" Khanna said in a statement.",

Shapiro had already spoken with FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi about the state's investigation.

One of them was about the 2028 presidential race. Shapiro has not announced plans for a 2028 presidential bid, and said he told Mr. Trump at the time that he was \"not looking to run.\"",
      "Shapiro said Mr. Trump cautioned him about pursuing a future presidential run.",

      "\"And he said, 'You know, being president's a really dangerous job.' And he rattled off other jobs that have a lower fatality rate than presidents. And he said, 'It's very, very dangerous.

School officials claimed the child was used by agents to knock on the door and ask to be let in, letting officers see if anyone else was home.",

      "School officials say a nearby adult on the scene offered to take the child, but ICE agents did not allow that.",
      "Later Thursday, McLaughlin went further, calling the framing of the incident as ICE using the child as \"bait,\" claims made earlier by the child's school district, were \"a horrific smear.\"",
      "\"Our officer's made multiple attempts to get the alleged mother who was inside the house to take custody of her child. Officers even assured her she would NOT be taken her into custody. The alleged mother refused to accept custody of the child. The father told officers he wanted the child to remain with him,\" McLaughlin said. \"Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administration's immigration enforcement.\"",
      "An attorney for the Ramos family said they had entered the U.S. through a port of entry in 2024 using the CPB app and had requested asylum.",
      "\"Every step of their immigration process has been doing what they've been asked to do,\" Marc Prokosch, the family's lawyer, said of the family's asylum claim. \"So this is just cruelty.\"",

      "\"Look, if I was going to list the five agencies locally and statewide I'm most worried about, I wouldn't put the Department of Corrections on that list,\" Vance said in a news conference when asked by CBS News if the state was cooperating. \"I think that while there are certain things we'd like to see more from them, they've hardly been the worst offenders.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday that Canada is no longer invited to join his\u00a0international Board of Peace, following days of tension between the president and the United States' northern neighbor.",
      "The president announced the move in a message to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Truth Social, saying the Board of Peace \"is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House and Global Affairs Canada for clarification.",
      "The decision came after Mr. Trump formally launched the Board of Peace at an event early Thursday in Davos, Switzerland. The board's official mandate is to help oversee the Gaza Strip under an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal brokered by the Trump administration last year, though Mr. Trump has hinted at broader ambitions, and exactly how it will operate remains unclear.",
      "Representatives from more than a dozen countries \u2014 not including Canada \u2014 appeared at a signing ceremony for the board's charter.",
      "Carney told reporters last weekend that he agreed \"in principle\" to join the Board of Peace, but he noted that key details on how the board would work and how it would fund Gaza's reconstruction remained unsettled. He also called \"unimpeded aid flows\" to Gaza a \"precondition for moving forward.\"",
      "His government also ruled out paying to get a seat on the board. A U.S. official previously told CBS News that countries can contribute $1 billion to become permanent members of the Board of Peace rather than having a three-year membership, though payment was not required as a condition of joining. Canadian Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne told reporters earlier this week that \"Canada is not going to pay if we were to join the Board of Peace.\"",
      "It's not clear why Mr. Trump rescinded Canada's invitation. But the U.S. leader has exchanged harsh words with Carney in recent days, adding to a monthslong dispute between the two neighboring countries over trade and Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "In a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Carney warned that the world is \"in the midst of a rupture.\" He pointed to the growing use of \"tariffs as leverage,\" the decline of international institutions and the risk that \"[i]f great powers abandon even the pretense of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power and interests, the gains from transactionalism will become harder to replicate.\"",
      "Carney didn't name-check Mr. Trump, but the speech was widely interpreted in part as a response to Mr. Trump's approach to foreign policy, which has drawn scrutiny in recent days due to his push for the U.S. to take over Greenland.",
      "A day later, in his own speech in Davos, Mr. Trump lashed out at Carney, accusing him of showing ingratitude toward the U.S. despite getting \"a lot of freebies from us.\"",
      "\"I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful. But they should be grateful to us,\" the president said at one point. \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Dept. suggested independent journalist Don Lemon could be charged after he was seen in video of a protest inside a church in St. Paul on Sunday.",
    "story": [
      "A Minnesota federal magistrate judge refused to sign a complaint charging independent journalist Don Lemon in connection with a protest inside a church in St. Paul on Sunday, multiple sources familiar with the proceedings told CBS News.",
      "\"The attorney general is enraged at the magistrate's decision,\" said a source familiar with the matter. Attorney General Pam Bondi has been in Minnesota for two days, as the Justice Department has sought to surge prosecutorial and law enforcement resources there.",
      "A different source stressed that the process is not over, and the Justice Department could find other avenues to charge Lemon.",
      "The magistrate judge who declined to approve charges for Lemon was Douglas Micko, sources told CBS News. Micko previously worked as a federal public defender.",
      "Lemon's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement Thursday that the magistrate's actions \"confirm the nature of Don's First Amendment protected work this weekend in Minnesota as a reporter.\"",
      "\"Should the Department of Justice continue with a stunning and troubling effort to silence and punish a journalist for doing his job, Don will call out their latest attack on the rule of law and fight any charges vigorously and thoroughly in court,\" Lowell said.",
      "The government had hoped to charge Lemon along with a raft of other people who participated in the protest at the church.",
      "On Thursday morning, Bondi announced two arrests connected to the church protests \u2014 Chauntyll Louisa Allen, who serves on the St. Paul School Board, and civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. Bondi alleged that Armstrong was involved in organizing the protest. Bondi later said a third person, William Kelly, was arrested.",
      "Allen and Armstrong both appeared in federal court in St. Paul on Thursday, where they were each charged with violating a civil rights law that prohibits two or more people from conspiring to interfere with constitutionally protected rights, like the free practice of religion.",
      "Micko, who presided over Thursday's hearing, declined to approve a second criminal charge against the two local activists that accused them of violating a provision in the FACE Act which makes it a crime to use force, threats, or physical obstruction to injure, intimidate, or interfere with a person who is exercising their First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of worship.",
      "In a copy of an arrest warrant against Allen obtained by CBS News, the second charge was physically crossed off, with \"NO PROBABLE CAUSE\" written in the margin. An attorney for Armstrong said that the magistrate judge also crossed off a charge on her arrest warrant.",
      "NEW: Arrest warrant for church protest suspect Chauntyll Allen shows two original charges but one is scratched off by magistrate judge for \u201cno probable cause.\u201d @CBSNews @MacFarlaneNews @JenniferJJacobs @SarahNLynch @camiloreports @WCCO pic.twitter.com/58LFuOXXzK",
      "Tension was evident during Thursday's hearing to review the arrests. Just minutes after Micko began the hearing, federal prosecutors conceded they had yet to provide copies of the arrest warrants to the two women arrested and their attorneys.",
      "\"We can get them,\" Robert Keenan, an attorney in the Civil Rights Division, told the judge.",
      "Micko then ordered a recess and vowed not to proceed until that happened, prompting audible gasps and some cheers from those in attendance watching in overflow rooms.",
      "When proceedings restarted, the Justice Department's request for Armstrong and Allen to be detained was swiftly denied, as were their requests for detention hearings.",
      "Keenan argued that the allegations involved \"crimes of violence,\" but Micko shot back that he didn't see \"any threat or use of force.\"",
      "Ultimately, both Armstrong and Allen were ordered to be released on condition they remain in Minnesota, stay off the church's property and avoid contact with any witness or victim.",
      "But later Thursday, defense attorneys told CBS News that both Armstrong and Allen would not be released pending the Justice Department's plan to appeal and seek their detention.",
      "\"This is the due process for the prosecution that doesn't seem to happen to folks we try to get out of Whipple [Federal Building] or any other f***ing jail in this city,\" lamented attorney James Cook, who represents Allen.",
      "A judge is expected to make a ruling on the Justice Department's appeal on Friday.",
      "Prosecutors also asked that the criminal complaints remain sealed despite the very public nature of the case \u2014 a motion that was approved for 24 hours.",
      "The two federal prosecutors who appeared in the courtroom are not from Minnesota.",
      "Before joining the Civil Rights Division, Keenan previously worked as a federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, where he argued that a local deputy sheriff convicted of civil rights violations should have his conviction on the felony counts struck and should not serve prison time. The efforts to strike the felony conviction led several prosecutors on the case to resign in protest.",
      "Most recently, he was dispatched to Louisville to handle the sentencing for a former Louisville police officer who was convicted of violating Breonna Taylor's civil rights, where he asked the judge to impose a sentence of just one day.",
      "Orlando Sonza, a former congressional candidate from Ohio, was tapped by Mr. Trump to work in the Civil Rights Division last summer.",
      "Protesters against ICE enter St. Paul church service",
      "Protesters said they entered St. Paul's Cities Church on Sunday, after discovering that an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official appeared to be one of the pastors at the church.",
      "Protests and clashes between some residents and federal immigration officers in the Twin Cities have been occurring daily since the Trump administration deployed thousands of ICE and Border Patrol agents to the area. Among other demands, protesters have called for accountability in the death of Renee Good, a U.S. citizen and Minneapolis resident who was fatally shot by an ICE officer on Jan. 7.",
      "Lemon, a former CNN anchor, attended the protest, which interrupted the Sunday service, prompting congregants and their families to leave.",
      "In an interview with the pastor, Lemon said, \"There's a Constitution and a First Amendment, and freedom of speech and freedom to assemble and protest.\"",
      "Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, has publicly hinted that Lemon could potentially face charges for his role in disrupting the service.",
      "Being a journalist \"is not a badge or a shield that protects you from criminal consequences,\" she said during an appearance on the \"Benny Show,\" hosted by far-right podcaster Benny Johnson.",
      "Dhillon declined to comment when reached by CBS News.",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., faced similar hurdles last year, after President Trump flooded the streets with federal agents as part of an initiative to crack down on violent crime.",
      "Prosecutors in U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office were ordered to pursue every case as a federal offense when possible \u2013 a plan that backfired as the Justice Department began to see grand juries reject charges and magistrate judges push back on cases they viewed as flimsy or that contained constitutional defects.",
      "In an Oct. 8, 2025, opinion, Magistrate Judge Zia Faruqui in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia revealed that over the course of eight weeks since the crime surge began in August, the government moved to dismiss 21% of all cases that were charged by criminal complaint.",

      "\"Why detain a 5-year-old? You can't tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal,\" said Superintendent Zena Stenvik.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security later said that the child was not targeted by ICE, but was \"abandoned\" by his father. It said his father fled federal agents as they approached his vehicle, leaving the child. DHS said the father, whom they described as an illegal alien from Ecuador, was later taken into custody as other ICE officers stayed with the child.",
      "School officials say there was an adult there who offered to take the child, but ICE did not allow that.",

      "Two weeks ago, a 10-year-old student in fourth grade was taken by ICE agents on her way to elementary school with her mother. During the arrest, the child called her father on the phone to tell her that ICE agents were bringing her to school.

    "summary": "A historic preservation nonprofit is trying to block ongoing construction of Trump's new White House ballroom.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge appeared skeptical of the Trump administration's claims that it has the proper authority to continue construction on the East Wing site that was demolished last year.",
      "U.S. District Judge Richard Leon heard arguments Thursday on a motion brought by the National Trust for Historic Preservation to block the ongoing construction of the East Wing until the Trump administration goes through the appropriate approval processes, which it alleges the Trump administration has ignored.",
      "Friday's arguments focused primarily on two issues: whether the president can unilaterally renovate the White House and whether he can do it with private funds that were transferred to an office under his authority, rather than with funds appropriated by Congress.",
      "Tad Heuer, an attorney representing the Trust, argued the law requires express approval from Congress to execute a project as significant as the 90,000 square-foot East Wing renovation.",
      "Congress provides the White House with a modest annual budget for the \"repair, alteration, and improvement\" of the building. The administration contends this authority encompasses the East Wing overhaul.",
      "Leon responded that the Trump administration's view is a \"very expansive definition,\" later adding that \"there's been an end-run around this oversight from Congress.\"",
      "Leon pressed senior Justice Department official Yaakov Roth, on whether \"ripping down the East Wing\" is similar to previous White House renovations, like the tennis pavilion added by Mr. Trump in his first term, or the swimming pool added in 1975 by President Gerald Ford. Roth argued it was akin to those projects.",
      "\"Come on. Be serious,\" Leon snapped.",
      "The $400 million ballroom is being privately financed. Donations were collected by a nonprofit organization, turned over to the National Park Service and then funneled to the Executive Residence at the White House, which is overseen by Mr. Trump.",
      "Leon repeatedly called the financing arrangement a \"Rube Goldberg,\" referring to the cartoonist and inventor who made complex contraptions to perform simple tasks.",
      "Roth argued that Mr. Trump \"cares about this, so he wanted to keep it in house,\" referring to the planning and financing for the project, which includes the ballroom, and a new secure bunker underneath it.",
      "\"Every construction truck of concrete\" that is brought to the East Wing site for construction constitutes irreparable harm to the public, Heuer said, arguing that Mr. Trump should have gone to Congress with a proposal to allocate funding for the ballroom before beginning demolition, instead of relying on a collection of private and corporate funds for the renovations.",
      "\"The president didn't want $400 million of taxpayer money to be used for this,\" Roth said of the ballroom, which is expected to be completed during the summer of 2028.",
      "He called any alleged harms \"speculative\" and said that Leon should not stop the construction in the middle of the project, citing \"national security implications\" and the risk of flooding or damage to the intact parts of the White House that are adjacent to construction.",
      "In December, the Trust filed the first major lawsuit against Mr. Trump and his administration in an effort to block construction of the ballroom, arguing no president is allowed to tear down parts of the White House \"without any review whatsoever,\" or construct a ballroom on public property \"without giving the public an opportunity to weigh in.\" The historic preservation group argued that the lawsuit isn't about the need for a ballroom, but about the need to follow the law.",
      "A week later, Leon denied a temporary restraining order sought by the Trust, finding that the group had not established enough irreparable harm to pause the construction outright, but the judge said construction crews cannot build any below-ground structures that would determine how and where the final ballroom structure will exist.",
      "Leon said he will likely issue an opinion in February.",
      "Earlier Friday, the administration provided an informational presentation to the Commission of Fine Arts. CFA advises the federal government on matters of design in the nation's capital.",
      "The presentation, led by White House official Joshua Fisher and chief architect Shalom Baranes, was similar to their presentation before the National Capital Planning Commission earlier this month.",
      "Baranes said the ballroom itself is expected to be about 22,000 square feet (110x200 feet) with 40-foot ceilings. It is expected to hold 1,000 guests for a formal seated dinner. The total East Wing renovation is slated to cover an area of approximately 89,000 square feet over two floors.",
      "On the upper floor, the renovated area will include the ballroom, a lobby, bathrooms and corridor connecting it to the East Room.",
      "And on the lower floor, there will be an office suite for the first lady, kitchen space, a movie theater and a corridor connecting the area to the main residence.",
      "The east wall of the structure, which faces the Treasury Department, has been redesigned from the original renderings. It will feature eight floor-to-ceiling windows and eight columns above the main guest entry stairway.",
      "Baranes promised a digital 3D rendering of the design in the coming weeks. He briefly mentioned the potential for renovations to the West Wing colonnade. He said no design work has been started but some structural assessments are underway.",
      "Mr. Trump recently appointed five new members to the CFA including Rodney Mims Cook Jr. who was voted chairman Thursday.",
      "Cook asked several questions about the project but seemed generally favorable to the design. His main concern was the scale of the building, as viewed from the south side of the White House complex.",
      "\"It's immense,\" Cook said. Baranes said the building's footprint extends just about 300 feet into the South Lawn.",
      "James McCrery, the commission's vice chairman, recused himself from the ballroom portion of the meeting because he was the project's original architect.",
      "Thursday's presentation did not require a vote from the commission. The White House will make another presentation at next month's CFA meeting.",

    "summary": "One year after President Trump announced it, the U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization. Infectious disease experts call the decision \"scientifically reckless.\"",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, one year after President Trump announced \u2014 on the first day of his second term \u2014 that America was ending its 78-year-old commitment, federal officials said Thursday.",
      "But it's hardly a clean break.",
      "The U.S. owes more than $130 million to the global health agency, according to WHO. And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.",
      "The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.",
      "\"In my opinion, it's the most ruinous presidential decision in my lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The WHO is the United Nations' specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.",
      "Nearly every country in the world is a member.",
      "U.S. officials helped lead the WHO's creation, and America has long been among the organization's biggest donors, providing hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise.",
      "On average, the U.S. pays $111 million a year in member dues to the WHO and roughly $570 million more in annual voluntary contributions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The loss of that funding and support is a matter of life and death, according to Dr. Judd Walson, an infectious disease physician, epidemiologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University who works to improve child survival, growth and development in low- and middle-income settings.",
      "\"There's an estimated over 750,000 excess deaths that will occur this year because of these changes, most of those in children,\" Walson told CBS News.",
      "Without U.S. participation and funding, he said, WHO has had to \"downsize considerably.\"",
      "\"There's less resources for data monitoring for potential threats such as pandemics, emerging disease threats. There's less resources for helping to support supply chains. All of those direct impacts of the financial consequences of our withdrawal are real, and there are many other impacts as well, that we will see as countries no longer have access to support their health systems,\" he said.",
      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency's \"failure to adopt urgently needed reforms\" and its \"inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\"",
      "WHO, like other public health organizations, made costly mistakes during the pandemic, including at one point advising people against wearing masks. It also asserted that COVID-19 wasn't airborne, a stance it didn't officially reverse until 2024.",
      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.",
      "Experts say the U.S. exit could cripple numerous global health initiatives, including the effort to eradicate polio, maternal and child health programs, and research to identify new viral threats.",
      "Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called the U.S. withdrawal \"shortsighted and misguided\" and \"scientifically reckless.\"",
      "\"It fails to acknowledge the fundamental natural history of infectious diseases. Global cooperation is not a luxury; it is a biological necessity,\" Nahass said.",
      "\"This not only makes Americans less safe, it makes the citizens of other nations less safe,\" Tom Bollyky, director of global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told KFF Health News when the plans were announced.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot wall itself off from transnational health threats,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. has ceased official participation in WHO-sponsored committees, leadership bodies, governance structures and technical working groups. That would seem to include the WHO group that assesses what flu strains are circulating and makes critical decisions about updating flu shots.",
      "It also signals the U.S. is no longer participating in global flu information-sharing that guides vaccine decisions.",
      "Such disease intelligence has helped Americans be \"at the front of the line\" when new outbreaks occur and new vaccines and medicines are quickly needed to counteract them and save lives, Gostin said.",
      "Trump administration officials say they already have public health relationships with many countries and are working to ensure direct sharing of that kind of information, rather than having WHO serve as a middleman. But U.S. officials did not give specifics about how many such arrangements are in place.",
      "Gostin, an expert on international public health treaties and collaborations, said it's unlikely the U.S. will reach agreements with more than a couple dozen countries.",
      "Many emerging viruses are first spotted in China, but \"is China going to sign a contract with the United States?\" Gostin said. \"Are countries in Africa going to do it? Are the countries Trump has slapped with a huge tariff going to send us their data? The claim is almost laughable.\"",
      "Gostin also believes President Trump overstepped his authority in pulling out of WHO. The U.S. joined the organization through an act of Congress and it is supposed to take an act of Congress to withdraw, he argued.",
      "The U.S. is legally required to give notice one year in advance of withdrawal \u2014 which it did \u2014 but also to pay any outstanding financial obligations.",
      "The U.S. has not paid any of its dues for 2024 and 2025, leaving a balance of more than $133 million, according to WHO.",
      "An administration official denied that requirement Thursday, saying the U.S. had no obligation to pay prior to withdrawing as a member.",

    "story": [
      "The White House posted a photo on social media that was digitally altered to make it look like a protester was sobbing as she was arrested in connection with a protest against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a Minnesota church.",
      "A photo of Nekima Levy Armstrong's arrest \u2014 showing Armstrong with a neutral expression \u2014 was first posted on X by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Thursday morning. The image the White House posted appears the same except Armstrong's altered facial expression shows her distressed, with tears running down her face.",
      "The White House posted the image of Armstrong seemingly crying with a caption calling her \"a far-left agitator,\" roughly 30 minutes after Noem posted the initial image. The altered version was also reposted on X by Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The White House's post drew a flood of comments from X users, with many saying the image appeared to have been manipulated.",
      "In response to CBS News' request for comment on whether the photo was altered, the White House press office sent a link to an X post by White House spokesman Kaelan Dorr referring to the post as a \"meme.\"",
      "\"Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue. Thank you for your attention to this matter,\" Dorr said on X.",
      "Digital forensics expert Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California Berkeley and co-founder and chief science officer at GetReal Security, told CBS News that while it's not clear how the image was altered, it was likely edited with AI.",
      "\"This is not the first time that the White House has shared AI-manipulated or AI-generated content. This trend is troubling on several levels. Not only are they sharing deceptive content, they are making it increasingly more difficult for the public to trust anything they share with us,\" Farid said.",
      "The arrest of Armstrong and several fellow protesters came amid a wave of protests across the Twin Cities following the fatal shooting of\u00a0 Renee Good by an ICE officer earlier this month.",
      "Armstrong is a civil rights attorney and former president of the Minneapolis NAACP who helped lead a demonstration during a Sunday service at Cities Church in St. Paul, where a local ICE officer apparently serves as a pastor. Noem said Armstrong is being charged under 18 USC 241, a statute that prohibits the intimidation of someone exercising a Constitutional right.",
      "She is expected to be released after a judge rejected a request for a detention hearing.",
      "Two others, Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly, were also arrested Thursday in connection to the Cities Church demonstration, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi. But a magistrate judge refused to sign a complaint charging independent journalist Don Lemon in connection with that protest, multiple sources familiar with the proceedings told CBS News. Lemon, a former CNN anchor, was there \"engaging in constitutionally protected activity as a journalist,\" his attorney said in a statement.",

      "President Trump led a signing ceremony for the founding charter of his \"Board of Peace\" on Thursday in Davos, Switzerland, as questions lingered over the body's operations and scope months after it was announced as part of the administration's peace plan for Gaza.",
      "The president hinted Thursday at wider ambitions for the board, beyond the war-torn Palestinian territory, and said repeatedly that the board would work with the United Nations, though he offered little detail.",
      "\"I think we can spread out to other things as we succeed with Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Once the board is formed we can do pretty much whatever we want to do ... and we're going to do it in conjunction with the United Nations.\"",

      "Here's what to know.",
      "When was the Board of Peace created and why?",
      "The Board of Peace was first announced in September as a key component of the Trump administration's 20-point plan for long-term peace in Gaza and the broader Middle East. It was described in that plan as \"a new international transitional body\" that would \"set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program \u2026 and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza.\"",
      "\"This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment,\" it said.",
      "The White House said in a statement last week that the Board of Peace would play an essential role in fulfilling all 20 points of the peace plan, \"providing strategic oversight, mobilizing international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions from conflict to peace and development.\"",

      "Britain declined to sign onto the peace board for now, U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.",
      "\"We won't be one of the signatories today,\" Cooper told the BBC Thursday. \"Because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace, when we have still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"",

    "summary": "The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, in his first appearance at Davos, said Tesla could start selling its Optimus robots next year.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",
      "The market for humanoid robotics is today valued at between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to Barclays analysts. But the investment bank expects the sector to expand to at least $40 billion by 2035, and perhaps by as much as $200 billion, as AI-powered robots enter labor-intensive sectors, such as manufacturing.",
      "Musk also talked up the future of autonomous driving.",
      "\"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point. And Tesla has rolled out... robotaxis in a few cities and will be very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.,\" he told Fink. \"And then we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe, hopefully next month. And then, maybe a similar timing for China, hopefully.\"",

    "summary": "Heavy snow, ice and brutal cold are expected to make this winter storm a potentially life-threatening weather event, stretching across two-thirds of the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "More than 200 million people across the United States are in the path of a major winter storm that's forecast to bring a mix of ice, snow and frigid conditions to a 2,000-mile expanse of the country through the weekend. About two-thirds of the U.S. could be affected by what will likely be the largest winter storm in at least five years.",
      "Freezing rain, snow and rain started Friday in the Southern Plains before it was forecast to move into the Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on Saturday and then head into the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Sunday into Monday.",
      "The system is forecast to be slow-moving, meaning long durations of snow and ice will have time to accumulate.",
      "Winter weather alerts continued to be issued from the Southern Plains across the South and into the Northeast through Monday, impacting at least 185 million people. Seventeen states and Washington, D.C., are under a state of emergency, and 35 states are expected to be affected by the storm. Nine states have activated National Guard troops.",
      "Extreme cold temperatures are also a major concern. Friday morning, thermometers in the Minneapolis area were at 21 degrees below zero, with wind chills even colder. Temperatures through the weekend are expected to sink to record lows across parts of the Southern Plains and Mid-Atlantic.",
      "Maps show what to expect from the winter storm",
      "A low-pressure system is forecast to develop in the Southwest and interact with incoming Gulf moisture and Arctic cold air. The system\u00a0began dropping precipitation on Friday in the Southern Plains.",
      "The system is expected to slowly move eastward, bringing snow and accumulating ice. Forecast models continue to change as the event nears, but it is set to impact broad swaths of the U.S., from Arizona to Maine, said National Weather Service meteorologists Rich Otto and Tony Fracasso, of the agency's Weather Prediction Center.",
      "Heavy snow is expected over a wide band of the country, with a foot or more potentially headed for parts of the Texas Panhandle and the Ozarks, Otto and Fracasso told CBS News. The highest snowfall totals \u2014 possibly up to 2 feet \u2014 could accumulate in the central Appalachians and into the Northeast, they said.",
      "According to CBS New York meteorologist Scott Padgett, some parts of New York could see anywhere from 6 to 12 inches of snow.",
      "Meanwhile, the polar vortex that is usually situated over the North Pole is dipping down into the U.S., bringing unusually cold temperatures starting Thursday and lasting through the first half of next week. Extreme wind chills of more than 50 degrees below zero have been reported in parts Minnesota and North Dakota.",
      "Communities from Texas, Arkansas and Oklahoma to Washington, D.C., and New York City could see records set for the coldest high temperatures. Frostbite can occur in as little as 5 to 10 minutes if exposed to this dangerous cold.",
      "The harsh cold means snow and ice will linger on the ground well into the middle of the week after the storm passes.",
      "Ice is expected to accumulate along the southern side of the storm's track. Considering the storm's slow movement, the amount of accumulation is expected to be up to three-quarters of an inch or even an inch of ice in some areas. Impacts of this magnitude can bring down power lines. With the harsh cold in place, power outages could leave people freezing without indoor heat in some communities.",
      "Parts of northeastern Texas, northern Mississippi and southwestern Tennessee will likely feel the most substantial effects of the ice, said Otto and Fracasso. They noted that icy conditions are also expected to have significant impacts on a block of the Southeast from northern Georgia into the Carolinas.",
      "Possible snowfall amounts upwards of 12-18 inches could be seen from the Southern Plains up into the Northeast, but the expected totals are still in flux for individual locations as forecast models continue to come together.",
      "As this system moves east, snowfall amounts will vary depending on location.",
      "Winter storm may impact travel plans",
      "Travel will be disrupted by weather conditions on roadways and at the airports. Some airports in the South do not have deicing equipment for aircraft to take off safely, possibly leading to widespread cancellations and delays over the weekend.",
      "Some airports that could see issues are Dallas Fort Worth International Airport; Will Rogers International Airport in Oklahoma City; Clinton National Airport in Little Rock, Arkansas; Memphis International and Nashville International airports in Tennessee, and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.",
      "Major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers, and many carriers are issuing travel alerts and allowing customers to change their plans without penalty as of Thursday.",
      "American Airlines, whose hub is Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, said it was adding 17 extra flights in and out of DFW on Friday, and Sunday to help the surge of travelers who were scrambling to make their trips. Eight of those were departing DFW on Friday, 17 on Saturday and nine would arrive at DFW on Sunday.",
      "The airline also added another 17 flights on Saturday between Charlotte Douglas International Airport and Chicago O'Hare International Airport.",
      "An analysis by CBS News found that at least 2,495 total flights on Saturday have been canceled across the U.S. so far.",
      "In a news release Thursday evening, Delta Air Lines said it flight cancelations would be \"necessary\" at \"select airports in North Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and Tennessee.\" It did not detail how many flights were expected to be impacted.",
      "The roads could also become very difficult to navigate, if not impossible, with slick conditions on major interstates such as I-10, I-20, I-30, I-35, I-40, I-44, I-49 and I-55.",
      "Travel on the roads is highly discouraged through the weekend, but if it's absolutely necessary, people are advised to drive with caution.",
      "\"Treacherous and hazardous driving conditions are likely due to both the ice and snow accumulations. In some areas, travel will become nearly impossible during the peak of the storm,\" said Otto and Fracasso. \"The extreme cold that follows the storm will prolong the potential impacts, with many areas not getting above freezing for much of next week.\"",
      "Officials urge drivers to consider taking a winter storm kit with them, including such items as booster cables, a flashlight, a shovel, blankets and extra clothing as well as water, a first aid kit and anything else that would help survive being stranded.",
      "Preparations underway",
      "About 18,000 utility workers have been pre-positioned in the Carolinas, while at Tennessee' State Emergency Operations Center, officials will monitor road conditions in real time.",
      "Outside Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma National Guard is on standby to help stranded drivers and passengers. The city and state have less than 100 plows for more than 1,800 miles of roads.",
      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said the city had \"procured 700 million pounds of salt\" in advance of the storm. Salt trucks were already out in force Friday, brining the streets and highways. \u00a0More than 2,000 sanitation workers and 700 salt spreaders were being deployed in the operation.",
      "\"Every piece of equipment is fitted with a specific kind of high-tech GPS that lets us get real-time data from around the city,\" Joshua Goodman, a spokesperson with the New York City Department of Sanitation, told CBS News. Goodman said that will help officials know which parts of the city are being hit the hardest.",
      "In Texas, heavy ice could weigh down power lines and trigger widespread outages. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a news conference Thursday that Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state's power grid, \"has never been stronger, never been more prepared, and is fully capable of handling this winter storm.\"",
      "Texas transportation agencies are working overtime to prepare, with officials hoping to avoid a repeat of the widespread outages caused by a paralyzing ice storm in 2021 that led to the deaths of more than 200 people.",
      "Stores throughout the South were packed with people loading up on supplies such as generators, flashlights and batteries. In the Fort Worth area, some shoppers were finding essential items out of stock.",
      "Meanwhile, staffers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago were preparing for a surge in cold-related trauma, with emergency room physicians on standby.",
      "\"We'll see a lot of patients for exposure, frostnip, frostbite, maybe some hypothermia,\" Dr. Scott Heinrich, a Rush ER physician, told CBS News. \"We see our vulnerable populations, those that are housing insecure, maybe our older adults without heat.\"",
      "Reasons for forecast uncertainty",
      "After weather prediction models showed considerable variation in their winter storm forecasts earlier in the week, the uncertainty is decreasing as the storm's arrival nears.",
      "Those variations seen earlier in the week were not unusual, said Otto and Fracasso, adding that there can be significant differences \"among forecast models 3-4 days ahead of the start of a storm.\"",
      "Predicting winter storms can carry an additional layer of uncertainty, as freezing temperatures create another variable in the forecast.",
      "\"For winter storms, the uncertainty is compounded due to the uncertainty in total precipitation amount in addition to the type of precipitation that may fall,\" said Otto and Fracasso. When the type of precipitation is snow, very slight atmospheric changes like temperature variations of just one or two degrees can alter the forecast dramatically, they added.",
      "Ash-har  Quraishi and \n                                                  \n                                  Jason  Allen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he has seen \"no evidence\" of a federal investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minnesota \u2014 Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison accused the Trump administration of turning immigration enforcement into \"politics and retribution,\" describing what he called a \"surge\" of federal agents in the Twin Cities as a constitutional crisis, and said he has seen \"no evidence\" of a federal investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month.",
      "\"In fact, I have evidence to the contrary that the federal government is investigating the death of Renee Good at all,\" Ellison told CBS News in an interview Friday.",
      "He added, \"Todd Blanche, who is the No. 2 at DOJ, said they're not investigating.\"",
      "At the same time, Minnesota authorities, Ellison said, are seeking a \"full, fair and joint investigation.\"",
      "\"In Minnesota, if you are killed \u2014 particularly if you're killed\u2026in connection with an action by an official federal or state, we will investigate your death,\" Ellison said.",
      "The state agency tasked with investigating Good's killing, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, withdrew from a joint investigation with the FBI a day after the shooting. It said in a statement at the time the agency said it had been informed by the U.S. Attorney's Office that \"the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation.\"",
      "When asked in a Jan. 18 interview with \"Face the Nation\" whether the ICE officer who shot Good was under investigation, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that the department was \"following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE, and under the Department of Homeland Security, and within the administration.\"",
      "Ellison on the apprehension of 5-year-old Liam Ramos by ICE",
      "Ellison strongly disputed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's assertions about 5-year-old Liam Ramos, who was taken into ICE custody outside his home. Ramos' image has been widely circulated across the news and social media in a photo that shows him wearing a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack. DHS said the boy had been \"abandoned.\"",
      "\"I don't buy that at all. In fact, there are very credible people who know Liam who refute that. I believe them over ICE,\" Ellison said, calling DHS' claim and subsequent treatment of Ramos \"another example of atrocity\" tied to the deportation effort DHS has dubbed \"Operation Metro Surge.\"",
      "Witnesses told CBS News that\u00a0ICE used the boy as bait to lure family members out.",
      "\"That is morally repugnant and nothing the federal government should ever be associated with,\" Ellison said.",
      "Suing to stop DHS' warrantless arrests in Minnesota",
      "Ellison's office and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have filed a federal lawsuit seeking to stop what they allege are unlawful tactics, framing the surge as a planned deployment targeting Minnesota, not a routine enforcement action. He argued the operation has been fueled by President Trump's anger over losing the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\"Mr. Trump said 'retribution.' He said he won Minnesota three times and that leaders here wrongfully denied him. So he's mad at us,\" Ellison said. Asked whether the ICE operation is about politics, rather than law enforcement, he replied, \"It's 100% about politics and retribution.\"",
      "DHS alleges leaders in Minnesota \"created disorder\" by failing to cooperate with federal law enforcement. Ellison called this \"a false statement\" and said planning for the surge of federal law enforcement had long been underway. He said he believes U.S. officials are shifting their rationale now because public opinion is turning against the operation.",
      "At the center of the lawsuit, Ellison said, are accusations of warrantless arrests without individualized assessment \u2014 including alleged civil immigration arrests without probable cause \u2014 along with racial profiling and what he described as excessive detention.",
      "DHS has claimed that there are a few arrest videos that were taken out of context.",
      "\"Yeah, well, they're going to have to defend their position in court, because that's not true,\" Ellison replied.",
      "If he's successful in obtaining an injunction blocking the DHS operation in Minnesota, it's not clear whether the state could enforce it \u2014 or that it would survive appeal to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Ellison acknowledged that uncertainty but said inaction was not an option.",
      "\"The only alternative is to do nothing and hope for the best,\" he said. \"We have to do all that is in our power to insist that the federal government obey the law.\"",
      "Ellison said the DHS surge is imposing significant costs on state and local governments, with \"hundreds of thousands of dollars\" spent daily on crowd control, overtime and emergency response.",
      "He also described a stream of injury complaints tied to pepper spray, tear gas and \"less lethal munitions,\" adding that \"literally dozens every day\" are making reports, while also emphasizing the harms of what he called unlawful detention and imprisonment.",
      "And pressed on whether the state would subpoena federal agents in its civil case to access evidence in the Good case, Ellison said legal and ethical constraints govern the boundary between civil litigation and criminal investigations, but he did not rule it out.",
      "\"We're going to do what is legal and ethical,\" he said.",
      "ICE's new authority to carry out warrantless searches",
      "ICE agents have seen their authority expanded \u2014 a May memo that was recently disclosed by whistleblowers said agents are authorized to use force to enter homes without a judicial warrant. Ellison called the policy \"unconstitutional\" and said he's heard reports it's being used in Minnesota. He signaled the state would challenge such actions.",
      "Cooperation with ICE",
      "DHS has said that Minnesota is not cooperating with ICE detainers \u2014 requests to hold detainees for an additional 48 hours so they can be turned over to ICE custody \u2014 or other requests for assistance. Ellison counters that immigration enforcement is a federal responsibility \u2014 not the state's \u2014 and while Minnesota is not a sanctuary state, state laws and court orders sometimes prevent the state from assisting ICE because it cannot hold criminals beyond their sentence.",
      "For instance, he said that if an individual sought by the federal government is arrested for driving under the influence, \"our courts don't have the legal authority to hold them once the court has said they need \u2014 they are to be released.\"",
      "He indicated that the state is following its laws as they're written: \"They're asking us to join them in breaking the law, and we can't do that. We believe in upholding the law.\"",
      "But cooperation with ICE detainers is uneven in Minnesota. In Hennepin County, where Minneapolis is located, the sheriff told CBS News that authorities do not notify ICE when detainees are released back into the community. The Department of Corrections, however, does notify ICE.",
      "DHS says that if every county in the state coordinated with ICE, federal agents could go home and ICE would not continue to conduct raids in Minnesota.",
      "\"They're saying, 'Oh, well, if you only would tell us, do our job for us, then we could go home.' No, you didn't,\" Ellison said. He added, \"ICE needs to do its job that it is paid to do, and it has a massive budget to do.\"",
      "\"Minnesota is not a sanctuary state,\" he told CBS News. \"We don't do the federal government's job, but we don't in any way obstruct them from doing their job.\"",
      "He suggested his state is at the center of a collision between politics and constitutional rights and warned that \"the only way to get along\" with the administration is to \"abandon constitutional rights.\"",
      "\"We must insist upon our First Amendment right to vote for whoever we please and not be persecuted,\" he said. \"We must insist on the Fourth Amendment protection to be free of unreasonable search and seizure.\"",

    "story": [
      "Syracuse, New York \u2014 Police officers in Syracuse, New York, were surprised in December to find a 55-year-old woman living among the dead at Oakwood Cemetery.",
      "The story of how Rhea Holmes came to live in that cemetery started years earlier with the death of her husband, Eddie Holmes. The couple had been married 26 glorious years and were planning to finally buy their dream house.",
      "In October 2020, they put in an offer, and it was accepted. That same day, however, Eddie died suddenly of a heart attack.",
      "So, instead of buying the home, Holmes took the down payment and spent it on a cemetery plot for her husband, with a bench in front of it for reminiscing.",
      "Unfortunately, living in the past took a real toll on her present. Left with little money and little left to live for, Holmes slipped into depression. She lost her job and got evicted. She was too proud to move into a shelter, so she took up residence at the only place she felt she owned: her husband's grave.",
      "\"This is what I purchased,\" Holmes told CBS News.",
      "Beginning in May 2025, she would volunteer at the nearby food pantry during the day, and then quietly slip undetected into the cemetery at night, where she would sleep.",
      "\"I assumed that I was going to die there,\" Holmes said of the cemetery, but then \"along comes an angel.\"",
      "In December, a retired officer who works at the cemetery noted Holmes' presence and contacted police. Syracuse Police Officer Jamie Pastorello responded and became the angel who took Holmes under his wing.",
      "\"It was just the right thing to do,\" Pastorello said. \"And I wasn't going to let Rhea sleep outside again. A complete turnaround, you know, in 20 days, she went from sleeping on the cold, hard ground in a cemetery, to her own home.\"",
      "First, he paid for a hotel room for Holmes. Then he connected her with the president of LeMoyne College, who let Holmes stay on campus while the students were on winter break.",
      "Pastorello also started a crowdfunding campaign and connected Holmes with a nonprofit called A Tiny Home for Good, which rents tiny homes at affordable prices to those in need.",
      "When a tiny home became available, Holmes was able to move in.",
      "Nothing will ever replace her husband Eddie, but the multiple hugs she bestowed upon Pastorello during their recent reunion provided the sense that this new friendship will keep Holmes from moving back into that cemetery any time soon.",

    "story": [
      "Former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding, an alleged drug kingpin who's been accused of orchestrating multiple murders, was arrested in Mexico and taken to the United States, Justice Department officials announced Friday.",
      "Wedding, a 44-year-old Canadian national, was taken into custody in Mexico City on Thursday night, FBI Director Kash Patel said at a news conference at Southern California's Ontario International Airport east of Los Angeles. During the news conference, Patel gestured to a plane behind him and told reporters Wedding had been taken off the plane.",
      "An FBI official in Los Angeles told CBS News the U.S. government plane carrying Wedding landed at the airport from Mexico at approximately 8 a.m. local time Friday.",
      "In a video clip provided by the FBI, a handcuffed Wedding is seen wearing jeans, sneakers, a sweatshirt, a vest and a baseball cap walking down a stairway from the plane flanked by FBI agents. Another clip shows Wedding and authorities walking away from the plane.",
      "\"Just to tell you how bad of a guy Ryan Wedding is, he went from an Olympic snowboarder to the largest narco-trafficker in modern times,\" Patel said. \"He is a modern-day 'El Chapo,' he is a modern-day Pablo Escobar, and he thought he could evade justice.\"",
      "\"El Chapo\" is an alias for Joaquin Guzman, a onetime leader of the notorious Mexican drug ring known as the Sinaloa Cartel who is serving a life sentence in the U.S. According to the FBI, Wedding also used aliases, including \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant\" and \"Public Enemy.\"",
      "Patel also said another fugitive who was arrested in Mexico last week,\u00a0Alejandro Rosales Castillo, was brought to the U.S. on the same plane as Wedding and would be taken east later Friday. Patel said Castillo's arrest wasn't related to Wedding's apprehension.",
      "Patel told reporters he was in Mexico on a previously planned trip. He said the Mexican government worked with the U.S. to apprehend Wedding.",
      "\"This was a great operation that came together through interagency success,\" Patel said.",
      "Patel said he wouldn't provide additional details about Wedding's arrest \"to safeguard the integrity of the ongoing investigation.\" He declined to comment on the $15 million reward that was being offered by the U.S. for Wedding.",
      "When officials increased the reward in November, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi described Wedding's alleged operation as \"one of the most prolific and violent drug-trafficking organizations in this world.\"",
      "The Justice Department said it expects Wedding's arraignment to take place on Monday afternoon in Los Angeles.",
      "Akil Davis, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said investigators worked for over a year to arrest Wedding. \"Ryan Wedding tormented several people and several families that will never be the same, but today, they get the justice that they sought,\" Davis said.",
      "Wedding, who competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, has been accused of running a major drug trafficking network that moved cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the U.S. and Canada. Patel said in a social media post\u00a0Friday that Wedding was running his alleged operation as a member of the\u00a0Sinaloa Cartel, and that Wedding was believed to have been hiding out in Mexico for over a decade.",
      "Wedding was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list last year.",

      "President Trump cited a major winter storm forecast to impact about two-thirds of the United States\u00a0as evidence to suggest that global warming does not exist, repeating a misleading claim that has been consistently debunked by climate experts.",
      "In a Truth Social post on Friday, he said, \"Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States. Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain \u2014 WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???\"",
      "Climate scientists say Mr. Trump's statement conflates short-term weather trends with long-term climate changes.",
      "The unusually cold air spilling into the United States is an example of weather, while climate is\u00a0 an average of temperatures across the world over time that shows warm areas outweighing cold ones, according to Dr. Steven Decker, director of Rutgers University's Meteorology Undergraduate Program.",
      "Global warming, which refers to the overall rise in global temperatures due to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is one aspect of climate change, according to the United States Geological Survey.",
      "Heavy ice accumulations are more likely to happen when there is a considerable amount of warm air next to cold Arctic air, Dr. Daniel L. Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, told CBS News. The accumulations require a substantial amount of the atmosphere to have warmer-than-freezing temperatures to ensure that precipitation melts instead of falling as snow.",
      "Mr. Trump has a history of repeating false claims about global warming, including in 2019 during a widespread snowstorm.",
      "\"Global warming continues and has in fact been progressing at an increased rate in recent years,\" Swain said.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently ranked 2025 as the third-warmest year since 1850. \"Notably, the 10 warmest years in the 176-year record have all occurred since 2015,\" NOAA said in its annual global climate report.",
      "Historical data from NOAA shows that the eastern U.S. has seen a winter warming trend over the past century.",
      "Meanwhile, most of the western U.S. has been experiencing record-warm winter temperatures, according to a database created by the University of California, Merced.",
      "There is evidence that warm air can weaken the polar vortex, a mass of strong winds that normally keeps frigid Arctic air locked in around the North Pole, and send outbreaks of cold air southward.",
      "Incoming cold air from the polar vortex is expected to play a part in the winter storm continuing through the weekend. Some states have already been experiencing extreme cold temperatures and wind chills, and the plummeting temperatures will stretch as far south as Texas.",
      "Swain also pointed out that Mr. Trump's description of this weekend's winter storm forecast was not exactly correct.",
      "\"'Record cold wave' is an objectively inaccurate way to describe what is currently unfolding,\" Swain said in an email. \"It is possible, however, that some locations could see record-breaking ice accumulations from this storm.\"",

    "story": [
      "The 5-year-old immigrant boy taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement alongside his father in the Minneapolis area earlier this week has an active and pending case in immigration court and cannot be legally deported yet, according to government records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "The ICE operation that led Liam Adrian Conejo Ramos and his father to be taken into government custody, captured on videos and photos that have gone viral, has garnered national attention and raised questions about who exactly the Trump administration is targeting in its mass deportation campaign.",
      "Justice Department records reviewed by CBS News indicate Liam and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Ramos, have immigration court cases listed as \"pending.\" The records by the Justice Department's Executive Office for Immigration Review do not list any deportation orders in either case, indicating that an immigration judge still must consider Liam and his father's claims before any deportation attempt. The information says the family's immigration court case was docketed on Dec. 17, 2024.",
      "CBS News was able to review the government information after obtaining the \"alien\" numbers issued to Liam and his father. Those \"A numbers\" are issued by the U.S. government to immigrants, illegal and legal alike, to internally track their deportation cases or immigration applications.",
      "Liam and his father are now being held at the Dilley detention center in Texas, ICE's long-term holding site for families with underage children, according to officials and the agency's detainee tracking system.",
      "Representatives for Liam and his father say the family is from Ecuador and that they entered the U.S. in 2024 to request asylum. The family's lawyer said they were able to get an appointment to enter the U.S. at an official crossing site along the southern border, with the government's permission, through a Biden administration system that relied on a phone app called CBP One. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said Friday the agency has \"no record\" of the family using CBP One.",
      "The Trump administration shut down the CBP One process immediately after taking office, and converted it into a self-deportation app now known as CBP Home. It also revoked the legal protections the Biden administration offered those who entered under the program, targeting some of them for arrest and deportation, including during immigration court appointments in cities across the U.S.",
      "The family's lawyer has said Liam's father does not appear to have a criminal record. DHS has called Liam's father an \"illegal alien\" and accused him of attempting to flee ICE officers, abandoning his son in the process. McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said Liam's father \"committed a federal crime by evading arrest.\"",
      "And while immigrants with pending claims cannot be legally deported, immigration officials do have the authority to detain them, if they're in the U.S. illegally or without a valid legal status, pending the adjudication of those cases.",
      "Prokosh Law LLC, the law firm representing Liam and his father, did not provide further information when asked about the family's immigration case.",
      "\"As their attorney of record, our primary concern at this time is Liam and Adrian's safety, well-being, and the work that is involved in getting them released from detention,\" the law firm told CBS News. \"While we do the relevant work to secure their release, we are unable to provide further information to the press.\"",
      "Dueling narratives about the arrest",
      "During a press conference in Minneapolis on Friday, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, said his officers targeted Liam's father \u2014 not the child \u2014 during an arrest operation on Jan. 20. Charles said Liam was with his father inside a vehicle when ICE officers approached them.",
      "Charles said Liam's father tried to escape on foot, \"abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.\" He said an officer stayed with Liam, while others arrested his father. ICE officers \"cared for\" Liam and took him to a drive-through restaurant, Charles added.",
      "ICE officers tried to get Liam's family to take the child but the \"people inside refused to take him in and open the door,\" according to Charles. He noted his officers were \"heartbroken\" by the incident.",
      "Sergio Amezcua, a pastor who said he's spoken to Liam's mother, noted she \"was terrified\" during the incident.",
      "\"ICE agents were trying to use the baby for her to come out of her house,\" Amezcua said on CNN. \"But the neighbors step[ped] up. Neighbors advised her not to do it.\"",
      "On Friday, Charles said families held by ICE get \"top-notch care\" at facilities like the Dilley center in Texas, calling their treatment \"better than social services.\"",
      "\"They have medical care. The food is good. They have learning services. They have church services available. They have recreation,\" Charles said.",
      "But advocates for immigrants have raised concerns about conditions at the Dilley facility. Neha Desai, an attorney at the California-based National Center for Youth Law, which represents migrant children in U.S. custody, said minors held at Dilley have experienced \"a dramatic decline in their physical and mental health.\"",
      "\"The current conditions at Dilley are fundamentally unsafe for anyone, let alone young children,\" Desai said. \"Since the re-opening of family detention, hundreds of families \u2014 including babies and toddlers \u2014 have been subjected to substandard medical care, degrading and harsh treatment and extremely prolonged times in custody.\"",

While the proposal aims to save consumers money, industry trade groups such as the Electronic Payments Coalition warn that a cap could lead lenders to reduce credit limits or even cancel cards for borrowers with credit scores below 740.",
      "\"Credit scores are really far-reaching in our financial lives. It's a part of the puzzle a lender uses to determine whether or not to lend to you, whether it's a credit card, personal loan, mortgage or beyond,\" \u00a0Courtney Alev, a consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma, a personal finance firm that offers free credit scores, told CBS News.",
      "She added, \"Anyone applying for credit should take every step they can to improve their score to get the lowest interest rates from lenders.\"",
      "What's a good credit score?",
      "Here's the range of credit scores and the share of consumers in each tranche, according to credit bureau Experian:",
      "Poor (300-579): 14.2%Fair (580-669): 14.9%Good (670-739): 20.4%Very good (740-799): 27.5%Exceptional (800-850): 23%",
      "Poor (300-579): 14.2%",
      "Fair (580-669): 14.9%",
      "Good (670-739): 20.4%",
      "Very good (740-799): 27.5%",
      "Exceptional (800-850): 23%",
      "Only 2% of Americans have achieved the top FICO score of 850, Experian says. But you don't need to have a perfect score to get better rates from lenders, financial experts note.",
      "A credit score in the high 600s or above 700 is considered good, according to Matt Schulz, a personal finance expert at online lending marketplace LendingTree.",
      "\"The higher you can get above 700, the better you are,\" he said.",
      "Cynthia Chen, CEO of Kikoff, a financial technology company that helps people build credit, said that any score above 760 can unlock access to the best credit products.",
      "How can I boost my score to 800?",
      "According to Experian, your FICO score is determined by five key factors, each carrying a different weight:",
      "Payment history: 35%Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%Length of credit history: 15%Credit mix: 10%Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Payment history: 35%",
      "Amounts owed, also known as \"credit utilization\": 30%",
      "Length of credit history: 15%",
      "Credit mix: 10%",
      "Recent credit applications: 10%",
      "Because payment history is the most impactful of these factors, accounting for 35% of your total credit score, experts emphasize that consistently paying accounts on time is the single most important step you can take.",
      "Indeed, a single late payment to your credit card issuer could knock off 50 or more points from your credit score, according to Schulz.",
      "To avoid making any late payments, Schulz and other experts recommend automating bill payment, although they stress that it's still important to monitor bills for mistakes and to ensure that the payments are actually made.",
      "\"That takes some pressure off of you,\" Schulz said.",
      "Keep your balance low",
      "If you can't pay your bill in full when it comes due, try to keep the balance, or your credit utilization rate, as low as possible.",
      "Your utilization rate measures how much of your available credit you've used. For example, if you made a $1,500 purchase with a $2,000 credit limit, your credit utilization rate would be quite high, at 75%. High credit utilization can take points off your score because lenders could see it as a signal of financial risk.",
      "\"Just because you can borrow up to a certain amount doesn't mean you should. When it comes to credit cards, you should only be borrowing what you can pay off in full at the end of the month,\" financial consultant Steve Azoury, owner of Michigan-based Azoury Financial, told CBS News.",
      "According to\u00a0Experian, people with exceptional credit scores, in the 800 to 850 range, have an average credit utilization rate of just over 7%.",
      "Alev of Credit Karma encourages consumers to aim to keep their rates below 10%. People with utilization rates above 30% can see \"meaningful negative implications\" on their credit scores, she said.",
      "While keeping your credit utilization low won't guarantee a top credit score, it is one of the most heavily weighted components.",
      "Limit applications for credit",
      "Avoid applying for too much credit, too often. Whenever you apply for new credit, a lender pulls your credit file or runs a so-called hard inquiry on your credit report, which affects your score.",
      "Each hard inquiry can knock off roughly five points from your credit score, meaning that multiple inquiries in a short period of time can have a large impact, according to Experian.",
      "Build a credit history",
      "The length of consumers' credit histories factors into their FICO scores, too. More than half of the people with 800-plus credit scores are older than 60, according to Experian, in part because they have established long track records of paying their bills on time.",
      "One way for a relatively new account holder to quickly build a credit history and demonstrate consistent payment behavior is to set recurring subscriptions, such as streaming plans or gym memberships, to autopay.",
      "\"If you pay it every single month, that builds payment history. You don't need to put a lot of charges on a card, but you need to show that behavior of consistent, on-time payments,\" Alev told CBS News.",
      "Kikoff's Chen said that consumers with only a few months of credit history should not expect to achieve a score of 800 or above right away, as all borrowers start with relatively low scores that take time to build.",
      "\"Scoring models want you to demonstrate your creditworthiness over the long term,\" she said. \"They need history to get to that level of comfort.\"",
      "Mix up your credit types",
      "Managing a variety of credit types, such as credit cards, auto loans and mortgages, can help boost your credit score.",
      "\"Credit mix is important because a lender wants to know how you do with different types of credit, and not just a personal loan or a credit card,\" Chen of Kikoff said. \"If you have a mortgage or an auto loan, the credit scoring model gives you points for that.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge says the Trump administration must keep the money flowing for now for programs aimed at helping low-income families with children in five states.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge ruled Friday that President Trump's administration must keep federal funds flowing to child care subsidies and other social service programs in five Democratic states \u2014 at least for now.",
      "The ruling Friday from U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick extends by two weeks a temporary one issued earlier this month that blocked the federal government from holding back the money from California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York. That expires Friday.",
      "The judge said he'd decide later whether the money is to remain in place while a challenge to cutting it off works its way through the courts.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said earlier this month that it was pausing the funding because it had \"reason to believe\" the states were granting benefits to people in the country illegally, though it did not provide evidence or explain why it was targeting those states and not others.",
      "The states say the move was instead intended to damage Mr. Trump's political adversaries.",
      "A judge previously gave the states a reprieve to the administration's plan to halt funding for the states unless they provide information on the beneficiaries of some programs, including names and Social Security numbers. The temporary restraining order was set to expire Friday.",
      "Around the same time as the actions aimed at the five states, the administration put up hurdles to Minnesota for even more federal dollars. It also began requesting all states to explain how they're using money in the child care program.",
      "The programs are the Child Care and Development Fund, which subsidizes child care for 1.3 million children from low-income families nationwide; the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides cash assistance and job training; and the Social Services Block Grant, a smaller fund that provides money for a variety of programs. The states say that they receive a total of more more than $10 billion a year from those programs \u2014 and that the programs are essential for low-income and vulnerable families.",
      "HHS sent letters to the states on Jan. 5 and 6 telling them they would be placed on \"restricted drawdown\" of program money until the states provided more information.",
      "For TANF and the Social Service Block Grant, the request required the states to submit the data, including personal information of recipients beginning in 2022, with a deadline of Jan. 20.",
      "In court papers last week, the states said what they describe as a funding freeze does not follow the law.",
      "They said Congress created laws about how the administration can identify noncompliance or fraud by recipients of the money \u2014 and that the federal government hasn't used that process.",
      "They also said it's improper to freeze funding broadly because of potential fraud and that producing the data the government called for is an \"impossible demand on an impossible timeline.\"",
      "In a court filing this week, the administration objected to the states describing the action as a \"funding freeze,\" even though the headline on the HHS announcement was: \"HHS Freezes Child Care and Family Assistance Grants in Five States for Fraud Concerns.\"",
      "Federal government lawyers said the states could get the money going forward if they provide the requested information and the federal government finds them to be in compliance with anti-fraud measures.",
      "The administration also notes that it has continued to provide funding to the states, not pointing out that a court ordered it to do so.",

    "summary": "Accumulating ice may pose even bigger problems than snow in this weekend's winter storm.",
    "story": [
      "More than half the country's population is in the path of a major winter storm, with some regions forecast to see more than a foot of snow \u2014 but accumulating ice may cause even bigger problems.",
      "Ice will be a serious hazard for some parts of the country, with the National Weather Service warning of potentially \"catastrophic accumulation.\" In areas that see freezing rain, sleet and snow, frigid temperatures in the days after the storm will keep things frozen.",
      "Hot Springs, Arkansas Mayor Pat McCabe told CBS News that he expects ice to be \"a real problem\" for residents and utility services in the area.",
      "\"Ice is really problematic. We'll deal with a little bit of snow. We've had major snow events,\" McCabe said. \"Then it warms up and then it gets cold again, and so the melting snow turns to ice and we still end up with ice even if we had snow.\"",
      "Ice can weigh down power lines, causing widespread outages, and the frigid conditions and high demand can strain the power grid. That's a big concern as far south as Texas. In the Lone Star State, a paralyzing ice storm in 2021 led to the deaths of more than 200 people.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has issued a disaster declaration for 134 counties. He said Thursday that the state's power grid \"has never been stronger, never been more prepared, and is fully capable of handling this winter storm.\"",
      "If an outage occurs, propane heaters or generators should not be used inside the home because of their dangerous fumes. Texas officials said some of the deaths in the 2021 ice storm were due to carbon monoxide poisoning as people sought warmth from cars and outdoor grills.",
      "Ice accumulations can also cause slick roads and slippery surfaces, leading to collisions or falls. In Nashville\u00a0and other cities, crews are pouring a chemical mixture called brine on streets to warm the asphalt so less ice forms.",
      "Officials are recommending people stay off the roads as much as possible, and drivers should be particularly cautious on bridges and overpasses, which may freeze sooner than other surfaces.",
      "Ice can also weigh down tree branches, causing them to break and injure people or damage homes. The weight of ice on roofs can also cause damage.",
      "Home inspector Lane Rockensock told CBS News he recommends clearing snow off the roof of a home to reduce weight, and making sure gutters are clear so melting ice drains away from the house.",
      "He said that in parts of the country that do not typically see snowstorms, homes and buildings can be at higher risk.",
      "\"Especially in the South, we don't build houses for 10 inches worth of snow,\" Rockensock said. He recommended homeowners keep faucets dripping to prevent burst pipes, and keep outdoor pipes covered. People should also monitor for water damage in basements, he said.",

    "summary": "A year ago, a law that effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. went into effect, though President Trump has not enforced it.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A year after a federal law that effectively mandated a nationwide ban on TikTok went into effect, the platform announced the formation of a new U.S.-based entity to comply with the statute.",
      "TikTok\u00a0confirmed Thursday\u00a0that a joint venture made up mostly of U.S.-based investors had officially been formed to take over the app's operations for American users.",
      "A group of three firms \u2014 U.S.-based Oracle and Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX \u2014 will serve as the venture's managing investors and own a combined 45% of the company, TikTok said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0late Thursday.",
      "Another 35% will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office and the quantitative trading firm Susquehanna International Group. ByteDance will continue to own 19.9% of the company, just below the 20% cap allowed under the law.",
      "\"The majority American owned Joint Venture will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "China and the U.S. both signed off on the deal to sell the app's American operations, according to a White House official.",
      "The bipartisan law, passed in 2024, required that TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "The law, which was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court, made it unlawful for app stores to offer updates or new downloads after Jan. 19, 2025. But President Trump has issued executive orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to penalize the tech companies who host TikTok on their platforms, keeping the app widely available in the U.S. despite the ban.",
      "It's unclear how the Chinese government plans to move forward. Its statements about a forced sale have been vague, though it has said that any agreement would have to comply with Chinese laws and regulations. CBS News has reached out to the Chinese Embassy for comment.",
      "Under the new structure, the app's U.S. operators will \"retrain, test, and update\" the content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok using data from American users, TikTok said. Oracle will also \"review and validate source code on an ongoing basis,\" according to TikTok.",
      "TikTok also said the U.S. version of the app will be interoperable with the version used by the rest of the world, confirming the White House's previous comments that Americans will still have access to global content under the new deal.",
      "The board of directors overseeing the new venture will include representatives from several of the investors, as well as current TikTok CEO Shou Chew. The U.S.-based venture's CEO is Adam Presser, who has worked at TikTok since 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "The arrangement is likely to raise concerns about whether it reaches the threshold of separation from ByteDance that lawmakers intended when they wrote the law. The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress ultimately left it up to the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\"",
      "GOP Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, told CBS News on Thursday that the panel will have a public hearing \"in the coming months\" focused on two questions about the TikTok deal.",
      "\"One is: Does it make sure that the CCP does not have influence over the algorithm? And the other is: Can we assure Americans that their data is secure? Those are the two questions that need to be answered as we go forward,\" the lawmaker said.",
      "Moolenaar added, \"most of us are not knowledgeable about the internal workings of that deal.\"",
      "For years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and U.S. officials, including the first Trump administration, sounded the alarm about the risks they argued TikTok posed to national security. The Chinese government could use the immensely popular short-form video app to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data and carry out influence operations, they said.",
      "During the court battle over the law in 2024, the Justice Department rejected the notion that Oracle could have sufficient oversight of user data and the algorithm to alleviate the national security concerns. By that point, TikTok had proposed a plan to mitigate national security concerns \u2014 known as Project Texas \u2014 that included storing U.S. user data on Oracle's cloud infrastructure and third-party auditing of the algorithm. But the plan was dismissed by the U.S. government and lawmakers as inadequate.",
      "The Justice Department cited the billions of lines of source code that comprise TikTok's algorithm, as well as the three years Oracle had estimated it would take to review the code.",
      "\"Ensuring compliance would require resources far beyond what the U.S. government and Oracle possess,\" a July 2024 court filing from the Justice Department said.",
      "Meanwhile, TikTok's lawyers said a sale was impossible because the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "A source familiar with the deal told CBS News that Vice President JD Vance led the administration's efforts to prevent TikTok from going dark in the U.S. Vance, according to the source, encouraged Google and Apple to restore TikTok to their app stores. The app was not available in app stores for about a month after the law took effect.",
      "Vance also spoke regularly with ByteDance, both the vice president and Mr. Trump joined some of the negotiations by phone, the source said.",
      "The source added that China was threatened with serious consequences if a deal did not materialize by the end of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials in Madrid in September.",
      "\"With this new entity under the control of U.S. investors, Americans can continue to enjoy TikTok safely and securely with their data protected in the United States,\" a spokesperson for Vance told CBS News.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna of California, who recently became the top Democrat on the China committee, said the deal is \"causing uncertainty among many creators.\" Khanna previously tried to repeal the law, citing concerns about its effects on free speech and the livelihoods of creators.",
      "\"I will be engaging with Americans and small business owners who depend on the app to find the best way forward and to prevent changes that could disrupt the rapidly growing creator economy while prioritizing data security,\" Khanna said in a statement.",

      "However, the trucks have faced a rash of mechanical and other problems. Last year, Tesla recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks over an issue with the trim panel, which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said could detach from the vehicle and pose a risk to other drivers.",
      "The vehicle has also faced recalls for issues with its rearview camera, windshield wipers and\u00a0accelerator pedals.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0European military veterans, families of the fallen, and politicians have voiced outrage after President Trump claimed the U.S. had \"never needed\" its NATO allies, and that allied troops had stayed \"a little off the front lines\" during the 20-year war in Afghanistan.",
      "\"The only time NATO has ever enacted Article 5 was after the 9-11 terrorist attacks on the United States, and the world rallied to the support of the U.S.,\" Alistair Carns, the U.K. government's Minister of the Armed Forces and a veteran who served five tours in Afghanistan alongside American troops, said in a video posted Friday on social media. \"We shed blood, sweat and tears together, and not everybody came home. These are bonds, I think, forged in fire, protecting U.S. or shared interests, but actually protecting democracy overall.\"",
      "More than 2,200 American troops were killed in Afghanistan, according to the Pentagon. The Reuters news agency says 457 British military personnel, 150 Canadians and 90 French troops died alongside them. Denmark lost 44 troops in Afghanistan \u2014 in per capita terms, about the same death rate as that of the United States.",
      "\"There are two great sayings worth remembering,\" Carns said in his video responding to Mr. Trump's remarks. \"Number one: 'There's only one worse thing than working with allies. That is working without them.' And when you do, always remember: 'Never above, never below, always side-by-side.\"",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Friday that Mr. Trump, \"was wrong to diminish the role of NATO troops\" in Afghanistan.",
      "Later Friday, Starmer called the remarks \"insulting and frankly appalling.\"",
      "\"We expect an apology for this statement,\" Roman Polko, a retired Polish general and former special forces commander who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, told the Reuters news agency.",
      "Mr. Trump has \"crossed a red line,\" he said. \"We paid with blood for this alliance. We truly sacrificed our own lives.\"",
      "Lucy Aldridge, the mother of the youngest British soldier killed in Afghanistan, told the BBC she was \"deeply disgusted\" by Mr. Trump's comments. Her son William Aldridge was only 18 years old when he was killed in a 2009 bomb blast, while trying to save fellow troops.",
      "\"Families of those who were lost to that conflict live the trauma every day. I'm not just deeply offended, I'm actually deeply disgusted,\" Aldridge said. \"This isn't just misspeaking, he has deeply offended, I can imagine, every NATO member who sent troops to fight in Afghanistan and certainly the families of those who never came home.\"",
      "The former head of the British Army, Lord Richard Dannatt, called Mr. Trump's comments, \"outrageous.\"",
      "\"Well frankly, one was dumbfounded, because they're [Mr. Trump's comments] so factually incorrect. Absolutely disrespectful to our nation, to our armed forces and to the families of the 457 British service men and women who lost their lives in Afghanistan,\" Dannatt told the BBC.",
      "\"The comments that he made \u2026 are just totally disrespectful, wrong and outrageous. It does make you wonder whether he is actually fit for the job that he apparently is doing,\" Dannatt added.",
      "\"We Europeans must do more, and if there's anything positive that Donald Trump has done in his assorted ramblings over the last year, it's actually to make that point,\" the former U.K. army chief said. \"European governments must really listen up, stand up now and find the cash that's needed to increase our military capability, not because we want to fight a war, but we need to deter further aggression.\"",
      "CBS News asked the White House on Friday about Mr. Trump's remarks on the role America's NATO allies played in the war in Afghanistan, and the criticism directed at him.",
      "Deputy press secretary Anna Kelly replied with the following statement: \"President Trump is right \u2014 America's contributions to NATO dwarf that of other countries, and his success in delivering a five percent spending pledge from NATO allies is helping Europe take greater responsibility for its own defense. The United States is the only NATO partner who can protect Greenland, and the President is advancing NATO interests in doing so.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Coast Guard and a tanker crew rescued a rower whose boat capsized while he was competing in a 3,000-mile race across the Atlantic, the agency said in a news release. He reported that he had been in distress for about 24 hours.",
      "Benoit Bourguet, 47, was in a single-man rowing vessel named the City of Liverpool, the Coast Guard said. Bourguet, a Belgium citizen, was competing in the World's Toughest Row Race, which spans 3,000 miles from Spain to Antigua. His boat was reportedly capsized by \"two rogue waves,\" forcing him to deploy a life raft. He was about 1,275 miles east of Puerto Rico.",
      "Watchstanders at the Coast Guard Sector San Juan Command Center in Puerto Rico received two emergency distress alerts overnight Wednesday. The first, recorded around 2 a.m., came from the City of Liverpool. The second came from a personal beacon device in the same location. The Coast Guard determined that the vessel had been part of the race and reached out to race organizers, who said they had sent Bourguet several messages but not received a response. Another team in the race also could not contact Bourguet.",
      "A tanker called the Horten was traveling about 110 miles from the distress signal. The Coast Guard issued an Automated Mutual-Assistance Vessel Rescue callout to the tanker. These callouts are used by search and rescue agencies around the world to assist people who are in distress at sea, according to the Coast Guard.",
      "The tanker, traveling from Germany to Guyana, diverted off-course. It took the ship over 12 hours to reach the distress signal's position, the Coast Guard said. During that time, Coast Guard officers remained in contact with the crew.",
      "Finally, the Horten arrived in the vicinity of the distress signal and spotted Bourguet's life raft. They were able to use a life ring to safely bring him aboard the tanker. Photos from the rescue show Bourguet's orange life raft with his boat tied to it.",
      "Bourguet was \"dehydrated but otherwise in good health,\" the Coast Guard said.",
      "The Horten's crew and race coordinators would arrange from Bourguet to be transferred from the tanker \"at a later time,\" according to the Coast Guard. No other vessels in the World's Toughest Row Race have been reported to be in distress, the agency said.",
      "The Coast Guard said the incident served as a reminder of the importance of having a functional personal distress beacon that is properly registered with nautical authorities. Zodiac Maritime, the managing company of the Horten, said it was \"immensely proud of our crew, whose professionalism, exemplary display of good seamanship in challenging circumstances and close coordination with the United States Coast Guard, helped save a life.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump's youngest son, Barron Trump, called U.K. police last year after seeing a woman being \"beat up\" on a video call, a court heard this week.",
      "\"I'm calling from the US, uh I just got a call from a girl, you know, she's getting beat up,\" Barron Trump, 19, told British emergency services in a phone call made on Jan. 18, 2025, according to a transcript sent to CBS News by the U.K. Crown Prosecution Service.",
      "When the emergency operator asked for more details, including the victim's name and age, Trump said: \"I mean these details don't matter, she's getting beat up.\"",
      "When pushed for more information about how he knew the woman, the president's son said: \"I don't think these details matter she's getting beat up but okay fine, also I met her on social media, I don't think that matters.\"",
      "Trump told the emergency operator that the woman was being assaulted inside her home in the U.K.",
      "\"She's getting really badly beat up and the call was about 8 minutes ago, I don't know what could have happened by now \u2026 So, sorry for being rude,\" Trump said.",
      "During an ongoing trial at the Snaresbrook Crown Court in northeast London, jurors heard on Thursday that suspect Matvei Rumiantsev, 22, had been drinking with the alleged victim on the evening of Jan. 17, 2025, according to Britain's Press Association news agency. Her name has been withheld.",
      "Rumiantsev told the court an altercation had been taking place when a video call from Barron Trump flashed up on the woman's phone, and he answered.",
      "\"At that point I was standing up, I stepped away from her maybe for a couple meters ... I answered the call and I immediately put the camera towards her. I don't know why I did that. Maybe I thought she would realize that her behavior was unreasonable, that she wouldn't behave like this in front of someone else,\" Rumiantsev testified.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Rumiantsev strangled the woman later that evening. He was arrested the following morning and is facing two counts of rape, among other charges. He denies all the charges against him.",
      "The court heard that Rumiantsev first became aware of the woman's friendship with Barron Trump at the end of 2024.",
      "\"I started to explain that I felt upset as well about her talking to Barron Trump,\" Rumiantsev said. \"I was in no way controlling, but I was trying to make her know that if she feels unwell seeing messages I had with girls 10 years ago, she could maybe understand how I felt when she was sat there this moment texting someone else.\"",
      "The nature of the relationship between Trump and the victim remains unclear, but according to CBS News' partner network BBC, he said in a written statement to the court in May last year that he had been \"told by the victim who I am very close with that this individual [the suspect] was giving her difficulty for a long time.\"",

    "summary": "While the first trilateral talks between Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. are a milestone, the issue of territorial concessions remains the key sticking point",
    "story": [
      "As the first trilateral talks between Ukrainian, Russian and U.S. officials were set to get underway Friday in Abu Dhabi, Moscow made it clear that Russia is not prepared to back down from Vladimir Putin's demand that Ukrainian forces pull out of the country's eastern Donbas region as a precondition for a peace agreement.",
      "\"Russia's position is well known: Ukraine and its armed forces must leave the Donbas. They must be withdrawn,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists Friday, referring to Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, much of which Russia has occupied during the nearly four-year war. \"This is a very important condition.\"",
      "Speaking Thursday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the fate of Russian-occupied territory in his country was the last issue standing in the way of a ceasefire deal.",
      "After President Trump's senior envoy Steve Witkoff said earlier that the negotiations were \"down to one issue,\" but declined to elaborate, Zelenskyy told reporters: \"It's all about the eastern part of our country. It's all about the land \u2026 This is the issue which we [have] not solved yet.\"",
      "It is the same crucial disagreement that quashed hopes for a peace deal late last year.",
      "Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after unilaterally annexing another part of Ukraine, the Crimean Peninsula, in 2014. After staging elections dismissed by most of the world as a sham in occupied parts of the Donbas region, Putin declared in September 2022 that four regions of eastern Ukraine had also been annexed by Russia. None of the annexations have been recognized by the U.S. or the United Nations, and most countries consider them illegal landgrabs.",
      "The nearly four-year, full-scale conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, and Russian forces continue making small but incremental advances in the Donbas as Ukraine battles to defend its territory with U.S. and European support.",
      "\"The issue of Donbas is key,\" Zelenskyy told reporters early Friday. \"It will be discussed, and the modalities as seen by the three sides will be addressed in Abu Dhabi today and tomorrow.\"",
      "The mere fact that Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are sitting down together with U.S. envoys for the first time on Friday has been taken as a sign of some progress, but there has yet to be any indication of movement on the territorial issue.",
      "Putin has threatened repeatedly to seize full control of the Donbas region if peace talks fail.",
      "Ukraine, backed by its European partners and the NATO chief, has warned that ceding territory to Russia would embolden Moscow to potentially pursue future attacks on its own territory and potentially neighboring nations.",
      "Zelenskyy's administration has refused to sign any peace deal that formally cedes occupied land to Russia, and it is also seeking a guarantee that the U.S. would intervene if Russia tries to launch another invasion in the future.",
      "The only way, Zelenskyy said Thursday, to deter Russia from such future aggression is a Western security guarantee that includes an American \"backstop.\"",
      "\"The U.K. and France are ready to actually commit their forces on the ground\" to monitor a ceasefire agreement, he said in Davos, at an event during the World Economic Forum, \"but the backstop of President Trump is needed. And again, no security guarantees work without the U.S.\"",
      "Zelenskyy said Friday that he'd had a \"really positive meeting with President Trump and his team\" in Davos, and that \"the main, core agreement on security guarantees is ready. Now I am waiting for President Trump to name the date and place. That is up to him. We are ready to sign documents that are extremely important for us.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday that Canada is no longer invited to join his\u00a0international Board of Peace, following days of tension between the president and the United States' northern neighbor.",
      "The president announced the move in a message to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Truth Social, saying the Board of Peace \"is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House and Global Affairs Canada for clarification.",
      "The decision came after Mr. Trump formally launched the Board of Peace at an event early Thursday in Davos, Switzerland. The board's official mandate is to help oversee the Gaza Strip under an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal brokered by the Trump administration last year, though Mr. Trump has hinted at broader ambitions, and exactly how it will operate remains unclear.",
      "Representatives from more than a dozen countries \u2014 not including Canada \u2014 appeared at a signing ceremony for the board's charter.",
      "Carney told reporters last weekend that he agreed \"in principle\" to join the Board of Peace, but he noted that key details on how the board would work and how it would fund Gaza's reconstruction remained unsettled. He also called \"unimpeded aid flows\" to Gaza a \"precondition for moving forward.\"",
      "His government also ruled out paying to get a seat on the board. A U.S. official previously told CBS News that countries can contribute $1 billion to become permanent members of the Board of Peace rather than having a three-year membership, though payment was not required as a condition of joining. Canadian Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne told reporters earlier this week that \"Canada is not going to pay if we were to join the Board of Peace.\"",
      "It's not clear why Mr. Trump rescinded Canada's invitation. But the U.S. leader has exchanged harsh words with Carney in recent days, adding to a monthslong dispute between the two neighboring countries over trade and Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "In a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Carney warned that the world is \"in the midst of a rupture.\" He pointed to the growing use of \"tariffs as leverage,\" the decline of international institutions and the risk that \"[i]f great powers abandon even the pretense of rules and values for the unhindered pursuit of their power and interests, the gains from transactionalism will become harder to replicate.\"",
      "Carney didn't name-check Mr. Trump, but the speech was widely interpreted in part as a response to Mr. Trump's approach to foreign policy, which has drawn scrutiny in recent days due to his push for the U.S. to take over Greenland.",
      "A day later, in his own speech in Davos, Mr. Trump lashed out at Carney, accusing him of showing ingratitude toward the U.S. despite getting \"a lot of freebies from us.\"",
      "\"I watched your prime minister yesterday. He wasn't so grateful. But they should be grateful to us,\" the president said at one point. \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"",
      "Carney fired back on Thursday, saying: \"Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian.\"",

      "School district officials in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, say their sense of security is shaken and their hearts shattered after four students from the district were recently taken by officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "The Columbia Heights Public School District says two children were taken on Tuesday, including a 17-year-old boy on his way to school. He was removed from his car and taken away.",
      "Then in the afternoon, 5-year-old Liam Ramos was taken with his father while in their driveway after just arriving home from his preschool classroom. School officials say the child was used as bait to knock on the door and ask to be let in, letting officers see if anyone else was home.",
      "\"Why detain a 5-year-old? You can't tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal,\" said Superintendent Zena Stenvik.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security later said that the child was not targeted by ICE, but was \"abandoned\" by his father. It said his father fled federal agents as they approached his vehicle, leaving the child. DHS said the father, whom they described as an illegal alien from Ecuador, was later taken into custody as other ICE officers stayed with the child.",
      "School officials say there was an adult there who offered to take the child, but ICE did not allow that.",
      "Federal officials said on Thursday that the boy and his father are together at an immigration processing center in Dilley, Texas.",
      "An attorney for the Ramos family, Marc Prokosch, and the school district deny that Liam was abandoned by his father.",
      "Prokosch said Liam and his father entered the U.S. legally from Ecuador and Liam's father doesn't appear to have a criminal record.",
      "Two weeks ago, a 10-year-old student in fourth grade was taken by ICE agents on her way to elementary school with her mother. During the arrest, the child called her father on the phone to tell her that ICE agents were bringing her to school. The father then came to the school to find out that both his daughter and wife had been taken.",
      "School officials say both children and their parents are being held in a detention center in Texas. They say Liam Ramos' family is following U.S. legal parameters and has an active asylum case with no order of deportation.",
      "The school officials also said they don't know what happened. They want the public to get involved as this is happening to students all across the state of Minnesota.",
      "\"We are asking to please reach out to your congressional representative to ask for an immediate and peaceful resolution to this occupation,\" Stenvik said. \"Please help us and other schools to again be a safe place where all belong and all succeed.\"",
      "The district also has an immigration lawyer to help figure out how to get the students back to Minnesota.",
      "Meanwhile, district officials say ICE continues to hang out around their schools \u2014 keeping kids, parents and staff on edge.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. has finalized its withdrawal from the World Health Organization, one year after President Trump announced \u2014 on the first day of his second term \u2014 that America was ending its 78-year-old commitment, federal officials said Thursday.",
      "But it's hardly a clean break.",
      "The U.S. owes more than $130 million to the global health agency, according to WHO. And Trump administration officials acknowledge that they haven't finished working out some issues, such as lost access to data from other countries that could give America an early warning of a new pandemic.",
      "The withdrawal will hurt the global response to new outbreaks and will hobble the ability of U.S. scientists and pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines and medicines against new threats, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University.",
      "\"In my opinion, it's the most ruinous presidential decision in my lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The WHO is the United Nations' specialized health agency and is mandated to coordinate the response to global health threats, such as outbreaks of mpox, Ebola and polio. It also provides technical assistance to poorer countries; helps distribute scarce vaccines, supplies and treatments; and sets guidelines for hundreds of health conditions, including mental health and cancer.",
      "Nearly every country in the world is a member.",
      "U.S. officials helped lead the WHO's creation, and America has long been among the organization's biggest donors, providing hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staffers with specialized public health expertise.",
      "On average, the U.S. pays $111 million a year in member dues to the WHO and roughly $570 million more in annual voluntary contributions, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "The loss of that funding and support is a matter of life and death, according to Dr. Judd Walson, an infectious disease physician, epidemiologist and professor at Johns Hopkins University who works to improve child survival, growth and development in low- and middle-income settings.",
      "\"There's an estimated over 750,000 excess deaths that will occur this year because of these changes, most of those in children,\" Walson told CBS News.",
      "Without U.S. participation and funding, he said, WHO has had to \"downsize considerably.\"",
      "\"There's less resources for data monitoring for potential threats such as pandemics, emerging disease threats. There's less resources for helping to support supply chains. All of those direct impacts of the financial consequences of our withdrawal are real, and there are many other impacts as well, that we will see as countries no longer have access to support their health systems,\" he said.",
      "In an executive order issued right after taking office, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was withdrawing from WHO due to the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises. He also cited the agency's \"failure to adopt urgently needed reforms\" and its \"inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\"",
      "WHO, like other public health organizations, made costly mistakes during the pandemic, including at one point advising people against wearing masks. It also asserted that COVID-19 wasn't airborne, a stance it didn't officially reverse until 2024.",
      "Another Trump administration complaint: None of WHO's chief executives \u2014 there have been nine since the organization was created in 1948 \u2014 have been Americans. Administration officials view that as unfair given how much the WHO relies on U.S. financial contributions and on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention personnel.",
      "Experts say the U.S. exit could cripple numerous global health initiatives, including the effort to eradicate polio, maternal and child health programs, and research to identify new viral threats.",
      "Dr. Ronald Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called the U.S. withdrawal \"shortsighted and misguided\" and \"scientifically reckless.\"",
      "\"It fails to acknowledge the fundamental natural history of infectious diseases. Global cooperation is not a luxury; it is a biological necessity,\" Nahass said.",
      "\"This not only makes Americans less safe, it makes the citizens of other nations less safe,\" Tom Bollyky, director of global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told KFF Health News when the plans were announced.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot wall itself off from transnational health threats,\" he added.",
      "The U.S. has ceased official participation in WHO-sponsored committees, leadership bodies, governance structures and technical working groups. That would seem to include the WHO group that assesses what flu strains are circulating and makes critical decisions about updating flu shots.",
      "It also signals the U.S. is no longer participating in global flu information-sharing that guides vaccine decisions.",
      "Such disease intelligence has helped Americans be \"at the front of the line\" when new outbreaks occur and new vaccines and medicines are quickly needed to counteract them and save lives, Gostin said.",
      "Trump administration officials say they already have public health relationships with many countries and are working to ensure direct sharing of that kind of information, rather than having WHO serve as a middleman. But U.S. officials did not give specifics about how many such arrangements are in place.",
      "Gostin, an expert on international public health treaties and collaborations, said it's unlikely the U.S. will reach agreements with more than a couple dozen countries.",
      "Many emerging viruses are first spotted in China, but \"is China going to sign a contract with the United States?\" Gostin said. \"Are countries in Africa going to do it? Are the countries Trump has slapped with a huge tariff going to send us their data? The claim is almost laughable.\"",
      "Gostin also believes President Trump overstepped his authority in pulling out of WHO. The U.S. joined the organization through an act of Congress and it is supposed to take an act of Congress to withdraw, he argued.",
      "The U.S. is legally required to give notice one year in advance of withdrawal \u2014 which it did \u2014 but also to pay any outstanding financial obligations.",
      "The U.S. has not paid any of its dues for 2024 and 2025, leaving a balance of more than $133 million, according to WHO.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House defeated the latest war powers resolution on Thursday in response to President Trump's recent military operation in Venezuela.",
      "Democrats continue to hammer the issue and have repeatedly tried to block further military action in the South American country, but the efforts have lacked enough GOP support.",
      "Two Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting the measure, which narrowly failed in a 215 to 215 vote.",
      "Republicans had to hold the 2-minute vote open for more than 20 minutes until Republican Rep. Wesley Hunt of Texas arrived to cast the tie-breaking vote, which defeated the measure. The delay in closing the vote caused an outcry from Democrats.",
      "\"Close the vote!\" Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan of New York yelled as it was on the brink of passage without Hunt's vote. \"This is serious s***!\"",
      "The vote comes a week after the White House peeled off GOP support for a similar measure in the Senate that also narrowly failed to advance. Two Senate Republicans who flipped their votes to help sink the resolution said Secretary of State Marco Rubio gave them assurances that the president would seek congressional authorization if the administration plans to put U.S. troops in Venezuela.",
      "The House resolution, introduced by Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, \"directs the President to remove United States Armed Forces from Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization for use of military force.\"",
      "Two prior attempts to limit Mr. Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-smuggling boats in the region fell short in December, before this month's U.S. operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "The first measure from last month \u2014 with the broader focus of removing U.S. armed forces from \"hostilities with any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere\" \u2014 had the support of two Republicans, while two Democrats voted against it. The second resolution focused on \"hostilities within or against Venezuela.\" Three Republicans voted in favor and one Democrat opposed it.",
      "McGovern's latest resolution had a similar outcome. Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska both backed it. The two also supported the previous unsuccessful efforts.",
      "Bacon pointed to a fake image shared by Mr. Trump earlier this week, showing the president, vice president and secretary of state planting an American flag on Greenland. The image included a sign that claimed Greenland as a U.S. territory as of 2026.",
      "\"When you ask me why I voted the way I did on the War Powers Resolution later this week\u2026 here's one reason,\" Bacon wrote.",
      "When the Senate's efforts to rein in future military action in Venezuela had short-lived momentum, Massie said he was hopeful that more Republicans in the House would change their stance. Days earlier, the U.S. had captured Maduro in an operation that came as a surprise to Congress. Mr. Trump then asserted the U.S. was running the country, worrying some Republicans who had previously defended the president's authority to carry out strikes on dozens of boats allegedly smuggling illicit drugs.",
      "Any GOP criticism of the strikes has mostly quieted as attention has shifted to Mr. Trump's crusade to acquire Greenland.",

    "summary": "The billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, in his first appearance at Davos, said Tesla could start selling its Optimus robots next year.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk, a long-time critic of the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, appeared at the gathering for the first time on Thursday, where he predicted that robots will eventually outnumber humans.",
      "Musk has previously dismissed the event, which this week is hosting multiple heads of state, business figures and others, including President Trump, President Emmanuel Macron of France and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "In 2023, Musk criticized Davos as \"increasingly becoming an unelected world government that the people never asked for and don't want.\" Musk, who last year led the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, is the world's richest person, with a fortune valued at $677 billion,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Asked about the goals of his companies, which include electric car maker Tesla and space exploration business SpaceX, Musk said that Tesla's mission now includes \"sustainable abundance\" through the development of robotics. Tesla is currently developing a humanoid robot, dubbed Optimus, as well as automated robotaxis.",
      "\"With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,\" Musk told BlackRock CEO and WEF co-chair Larry Fink in a one-on-one interview. \"People often talk about solving global poverty \u2014 how do we give everyone a very high standard of living? The only way to do this is AI and robotics.\"",
      "Musk added that he envisions a day when robotics are \"ubiquitous,\" which he said would unleash \"an explosion in the global economy.\"",
      "\"My prediction is there will be more robots than people,\" he said, adding that humanoid robots could help provide elder care in a world where there aren't enough young people to take care of older citizens.",
      "Optimus may hit the market in 2027",
      "Asked by Fink how quickly robots might be more widely available, Musk said that Tesla's Optimus robots are currently performing \"simple tasks in the factory.\"",
      "\"By the end of this year, I think they will be doing more complex tasks, and probably by the end of next year, I think we'd be selling humanoid robots to the public,\" Musk added. \"That's when we are confident it'll have very high reliability \u2014 you can basically ask it to do anything you like.\"",

      "\"I'm actually more hopeful today than I have been for over a year,\" Mikkel Runge Olesen, a foreign policy senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told CBS News on Thursday from Copenhagen. \"There is a cautious sense of optimism, maybe even a little bit of relief in Denmark and in Greenland right now. But it is cautious, because we've seen it go wrong before.\"",
      "Olesen said it seemed that, after Mr. Trump's meeting with Rutte, things were \"moving away from that deadlock where Trump wanted something that it was completely impossible for Denmark and Greenland to give willingly, right, to something where it might become a more classical negotiation about base rights, about authority, about ground rules for a likely increased American presence agreement.\"",
      "In a statement released early Thursday, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen appeared to support Rutte and the outcome of his meeting with Mr. Trump, stressing that she had spoken with the NATO leader both before and after his meeting with the U.S. president.",
      "\"NATO is fully aware of the position of the Kingdom of Denmark. We can negotiate on everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty,\" Frederiksen said. \"I have been informed that this has not been the case either.\"",
      "\"The Kingdom of Denmark wishes to continue to engage in a constructive dialogue with allies on how we can strengthen security in the Arctic, including the U.S.'s Golden Dome, provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity,\" Frederiksen said, referring to Mr. Trump's plan for a new national missile defense system.",
      "Aaja Chenmitz, a Greenlandic lawmaker in Denmark's parliament, told the BBC on Thursday, however, that, \"NATO in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us.\"",
      "In an interview with Fox News that broadcast on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the deal with America's NATO allies would see \"a piece of\" the Golden Dome system located in Greenland.",
      "\"And it's a very important part, because it's, everything comes over Greenland, if the bad guys start shooting, it comes over Greenland,\" he said. \"So, we knock it down \u2026 it's pretty infallible.\"",
      "Finland's Prime Minister, Petteri Orpo, told CBS News that he also thought Rutte had done, \"a really good job in sort of de-escalating things. Many of us were working together with American senators and the U.S. administration to do that. But of course, it's not over. We still have a process going on, Danes, Greenlanders, and Americans negotiating on the status of Greenland.\"",
      "There's \"no need to escalate the situation any further. Now it's just good to bring down the temperature,\" Orpo said.",
      "Britain's Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper offered a little more detail on what might have been agreed between Mr. Trump and his NATO partners, telling the BBC on Thursday that the U.K. had proposed working \"through NATO on a new Arctic Sentry, which is similar to what we already have through NATO \u2014 a Baltic Sentry and an Eastern Sentry,\" referring to existing regional security partnerships among NATO allies.",
      "\"Those are really combined operations programs that draw together NATO countries to work on a shared threat,\" Cooper said. \"So what we have proposed is to do an Arctic sentry through NATO as well. What my understanding is from the discussions we've had with the NATO general secretary, who has set out some of the points that he was talking about yesterday, is that this is now going to be a focus of work through NATO with different Arctic countries coming together and supported by other NATO countries on how we do that shared security.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump has framed Arctic security concerns as a key driver of his push to acquire Greenland \u2014 specifically claiming Russia and China would take over the island if the U.S. didn't \u2014 he has also repeatedly cited the Danish territory's yet-to-be exploited mineral resources as a priority.",
      "Asked if the tentative deal reached on Wednesday included any mention of those resources, Cooper said she was \"not aware of any discussions on that at all.\"",
      "Olesen, the Danish analyst, said he expected the current, long-standing defense agreement between the United States, Denmark and Greenland to be the starting point for negotiations.",
      "\"This could indeed end in something that will be an update of the defense agreement, perhaps a little bit more than that will be needed. Perhaps we will see some negotiations about rare earth metals. Perhaps we will see some sort of negotiation about limiting Chinese and Russian influence agreements, something like that. But that in negotiation, for the first time in a long while, a negotiated settlement does seem to be within reach,\" Olesen said.",

      "The Northwest Passage, which comes close to Greenland, is not currently viable for the entire year.",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use northern sea passages that enable shippers to save time and millions of dollars in fuel by taking shorter routes between Europe and Asia that were long only passable in warmer months.",
      "There are a couple primary routes through the Arctic becoming more viable. The Northern Sea Route, which follows Russia's long northern border, doesn't bring ships too close to Greenland, and Russia and China agreed to jointly develop that path and have been making greater use of it in recent years.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the Northern Sea Route in the winter in February 2021.",

      "Olesen, the Danish foreign policy researcher, said these minerals are still very expensive to extract, so it hasn't so far made economic sense for private companies to go after them.",
      "\"The position of the Greenland government has been for a long time that Greenland is open for business, and with few exceptions, the main reason for why not much has happened has been that there hasn't been a business case for American companies,\" Olesen said, adding, \"nothing has prevented U.S. companies from going in for a long time.\"",

      "The president hinted Thursday at wider ambitions for the board, beyond the war-torn Palestinian territory, and said repeatedly that the board would work with the United Nations, though he offered little detail.",
      "\"I think we can spread out to other things as we succeed with Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Once the board is formed we can do pretty much whatever we want to do ... and we're going to do it in conjunction with the United Nations.\"",

      "Here's what to know.",

      "The Board of Peace was first announced in September as a key component of the Trump administration's 20-point plan for long-term peace in Gaza and the broader Middle East. It was described in that plan as \"a new international transitional body\" that would \"set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program \u2026 and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza.\"",
      "\"This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment,\" it said.",
      "The White House said in a statement last week that the Board of Peace would play an essential role in fulfilling all 20 points of the peace plan, \"providing strategic oversight, mobilizing international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions from conflict to peace and development.\"",

      "The Board of Peace is chaired by President Trump, who can hold that position until he resigns from it, according to a U.S. official.",

      "Israel and Canada were among the nations that previously announced they were accepting Mr. Trump's invitation to join, although they did not appear on the White House list. Mr. Trump later said Canada is no longer invited to join following recent tensions with the U.S. neighbor.",
      "Major European allies did not immediately sign onto the board, with many voicing concern over Mr. Trump's invitations to Putin and Lukashenko.",
      "Britain declined to sign onto the peace board for now, U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said.",
      "\"We won't be one of the signatories today,\" Cooper told the BBC Thursday. \"Because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues, and we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace, when we have still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"",
      "Norway and Sweden said Wednesday they were holding off, at least for now, due to concerns about the terms for joining.",
      "A source familiar with the matter told CBS News earlier this week that France intended to decline due to concerns that the Board of Peace charter goes beyond the framework of Gaza and raises major issues, particularly regarding respect for the principles and structure of the United Nations.",
      "In response, Mr. Trump said Monday night he would impose 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne if they did not join the Board of Peace. The White House has not responded to several inquiries as to whether or not the president was joking.",
      "A French official said they have taken note of Mr. Trump's statements and called the use of tariff threats to influence France's foreign policy unacceptable and ineffective.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the board a work in progress, indicating an expectation by the Trump administration that membership would rise. \"Many others who are going to join, you know, others either are not in town today or they have to go through some procedure internally in their own countries, in their own country, because of constitutional limitations, but others will join,\" Rubio said in Davos on Thursday.",
      "Is the Board of Peace intended to replace the United Nations?",
      "President Trump said\u00a0Thursday that the board would be committed to ensuring Gaza's demilitarization, and hinted at wider ambitions for the group going forward.",
      "He said the board would work \"coupled with the United Nations\" to create a \"safer future for the world, unfolding before your eyes,\" adding that the board would help to \"end decades of suffering.\"",
      "The president also said the board can do \"pretty much whatever we want to do\" once it is formed, and that \"we're going to do it in conjunction with the United Nations.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump said the Board of Peace \"might\" replace the world's primary global body.",
      "\"I mean, the U.N. just hasn't been very helpful. I'm a big fan of the U.N. potential. But it has never lived up to its potential,\" he said in a more than 90-minute press conference at the White House on Tuesday, Jan. 20.",
      "But he added, \"I believe you've got to let the U.N. continue because the potential is so great.\"",
      "In November, the United Nations passed a Security Council resolution that approved a \"Board of Peace,\" but with a focus limited only to Gaza.",
      "The resolution welcomed the establishment of a Board of Peace \"as a transitional administration with international legal personality\" that would set the framework and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "The U.N. resolution more broadly endorsed the Trump administration's 20-point Gaza peace plan, and authorized countries working with the Board of Peace to establish a stabilization force inside the Palestinian territory.",
      "Is a financial contribution required to join?",
      "A U.S. official confirmed a Bloomberg report that countries can contribute $1 billion to the Board of Peace to become permanent members instead of having a three-year membership. The official also said it isn't a requirement to contribute to become a member.",
      "The official told CBS News that any contributions will be used to rebuild Gaza and said \"virtually every dollar\" raised will be spent on the board's mandate. There will be no \"exorbitant salaries\" or \"administrative bloat,\" the official said.",

      "\"While there's no strict age cutoff, generally above the age of mid 40s and above, we tend to be a little more cautious \u2014 particularly in people who are less active [without] regular exercise,\" Dr. Navjot Kaur Sobti, M.D., an interventional cardiologist at Northwell\u2019s Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York, previously told Fox News Digital.",

      "So far, no known ransomware group has publicly taken credit for the attack. That might sound like good news, but it does not necessarily change the risk for affected individuals. In many ransomware cases, silence can mean one of two things. Either the attackers have not yet posted stolen data publicly, or the victim company may have resolved the incident privately.",
      "Gulshan's filing states that it restored its systems using known-safe backups. That detail often suggests a company chose to rebuild rather than negotiate with attackers. Even so, once data has been copied out of a network, there is no way to pull it back. Whether or not the stolen information ever appears online, the exposure alone puts affected people at long-term risk.",
      "This incident also highlights a recurring pattern. Retail and service businesses handle huge volumes of personal data but often rely on legacy systems and frontline employees who are prime phishing targets. Gas stations may not feel like obvious hacking targets, but their payment systems, loyalty programs and HR databases make them valuable all the same.",

      "Check your reports from all major credit bureaus for unfamiliar accounts or inquiries. You're entitled to free reports, and catching issues early makes them much easier to fix.",
      "If criminals expose your Social Security number, place a credit freeze as soon as possible. A credit freeze blocks lenders from opening new accounts in your name, even when thieves have your personal details. The credit bureaus offer freezes for free, and you can temporarily lift one when you apply for credit yourself. This step stops identity theft before it starts, instead of alerting you after the damage is done. If you prefer not to freeze your credit, place a fraud alert instead. A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before approving credit, which adds another layer of protection.",

      "When Social Security numbers are stolen, tax fraud often follows. Criminals can file fake tax returns in your name to steal refunds before you ever submit your paperwork. An IRS Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) helps prevent this by ensuring only you can file a tax return using your SSN. It's a simple but powerful safeguard that can block a common form of identity theft tied to data breaches.",
      "Don't just watch for new fraud, proactively secure the accounts you already have. Enable alerts on bank and credit card accounts for large transactions, new payees, or changes to contact information. If your SSN or driver's license number was exposed, consider calling your bank to ask about additional protections or account notes. Acting early can prevent small issues from becoming major financial problems.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Your personal data doesn't just live with banks and hospitals. Retailers, gas stations, and convenience store operators also hold information that can cause real harm if it falls into the wrong hands. When attackers get in through something as simple as a phishing email and stay undetected for days, the damage can spread fast. You can't prevent these breaches yourself, but you can limit how much power stolen data gives criminals by locking down your accounts and staying alert.",

    "summary": "California startup Pliyt unveils autonomous vehicle with private pods, revolutionizing ride-sharing by eliminating forced passenger interaction and awkward conversations.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson takes a look at the Mercedes Vision V luxury van and its 65-inch screen, 42 speakers and first-class comfort.",
      "Crowded cabins and forced small talk have long defined ride-sharing. A California startup wants to flip that idea on its head.",
      "Pliyt believes the future of ride-sharing means sharing the ride as little as possible. Instead of one shared cabin, its autonomous vehicle concept divides the interior into four fully independent pods. Each one acts like a private room on wheels.",
      "The goal is simple. Get you from point A to point B without invading your personal space.",

      "How Pliyt's autonomous pods work",
      "One-way glass and independent controls keep each rider anonymous, even when the vehicle is shared. (Pliyt)",
      "Pliyt's vehicle is designed from the inside out. Each passenger rides inside a self-contained capsule that prioritizes privacy, comfort and control. The company says the idea resonated strongly when the prototype debuted at CES earlier this month. Here is what sets the concept apart:",

      "Independent lighting, sound and privacy controls",
      "Personalized entertainment for gaming, streaming or screencasting",
      "A retractable workstation with a large display and a side table",
      "You decide how social or private your ride feels. Traveling with a companion? The divider between pods can be lowered so you can share the space by choice.",
      "\"We believe rider choice and personal space will be foundational to the future of shared autonomous mobility,\" the company told CyberGuy. \"As vehicles become autonomous, differentiation will shift from driving to experience. Giving riders control over privacy, comfort, and interaction, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all shared cabin, will be critical for trust and adoption, especially in dense urban environments. Shared mobility doesn't have to mean shared personal space, and we see that as a key evolution of the category.\"",
      "Is Pliyt fully autonomous?",
      "Yes. Pliyt vehicles are designed to operate without human drivers. However, the company does not plan to build its own autonomous driving system. Instead, Pliyt intends to partner with established autonomy providers once development progresses.",
      "\"Our current plan is to launch an initial service in San Francisco around 2028, beginning with controlled, geo-fenced deployments and expanding gradually as autonomy, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks mature,\" a spokesperson for Pliyt told CyberGuy. \"Our focus today is on building the right vehicle architecture, partnerships, and user experience to support that rollout responsibly.\"",
      "Pliyt\u2019s concept vehicle replaces a shared cabin with four fully enclosed pods designed for personal space and comfort. (Pliyt)",
      "Privacy-first design sets Pliyt apart",
      "Privacy sits at the center of Pliyt's design philosophy. Every pod is built for in-ride anonymity even during shared trips. Fellow passengers cannot see you, and you cannot see them unless you choose to. This approach stands out in a world where many mobility platforms depend on data collection and shared environments. Pliyt positions privacy as foundational rather than optional. The company says no personal identities are visible during rides. The experience aims to feel calm, intentional and free from observation.",
      "CAN AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REALLY MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFER?",
      "Comfort without the awkwardness",
      "Pliyt also leans heavily into comfort. Seats feature what the company calls zero-gravity positioning. You will not float like an astronaut, but the posture is designed to reduce pressure and fatigue. Large windows offer panoramic city views while still maintaining privacy. Personal lighting and climate controls help tailor the ride to your preferences. If relaxing is not your goal, productivity comes built in. The retractable workstation allows you to work, review documents or create content while moving through the city.",

      "How Pliyt compares to other autonomous vehicles",
      "Autonomous pods are not entirely new. Companies like Zoox and Waymo already operate self-driving vehicles with unique interiors. Waymo's Zeekr RT, for example, focuses on spacious seating and rider comfort. Pliyt's difference lies in isolation by design. Instead of rethinking a shared cabin, it breaks the vehicle into four private spaces. The result feels closer to a personal lounge than a ride-share.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If this concept becomes reality, ride-sharing could feel very different. No forced conversations. No shared armrests. No feeling watched. For commuters, it could mean working quietly on the way to the office. For travelers, it could mean relaxing without distractions. For introverts, it could mean finally enjoying shared mobility on their own terms. It also raises bigger questions about how future cities balance efficiency with dignity and personal space.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "The interior divider can be lowered, allowing passengers to share space with a companion while keeping control over privacy. (Pliyt)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Pliyt is not promising faster rides or cheaper fares. It is promising something more subtle. A calmer, more respectful way to move through cities. Whether the concept scales will depend on partnerships, regulation and public adoption. Still, the idea challenges long-standing assumptions about what ride-sharing has to feel like. If autonomous vehicles are coming either way, designs like this suggest they do not have to feel crowded or impersonal.",

      "Researchers are tracking a long-running web skimming campaign that targets businesses connected to major payment networks. Web skimming is a technique where criminals secretly add malicious code to checkout pages so they can steal payment details as shoppers type them in.",
      "These attacks work quietly inside the browser and often leave no obvious signs. Most victims only discover the problem after unauthorized charges appear on their statements.",

      "WHATSAPP WEB MALWARE SPREADS BANKING TROJAN AUTOMATICALLY",
      "Web skimming attacks hide inside checkout pages and steal card details as shoppers type them in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What Magecart is and why it matters",
      "Magecart is the name researchers use for groups that specialize in web-skimming attacks. These attacks focus on online stores where shoppers enter payment details during checkout. Instead of hacking banks or card networks directly, attackers slip malicious code into a store's checkout page. That code is written in JavaScript, which is a common type of website code used to make pages interactive. Legitimate sites use it for things like forms, buttons and payment processing.",
      "In Magecart attacks, criminals abuse that same code to secretly copy card numbers, expiration dates, security codes and billing details as shoppers type them in. The checkout still works, and the purchase goes through, so there is no obvious warning sign. Magecart originally described attacks against Magento-based online stores. Today, the term applies to web-skimming campaigns across many e-commerce platforms and payment systems.",
      "Which payment providers are being targeted?",
      "Researchers say this campaign targets merchants tied to several major payment networks, including:",
      "American ExpressDiners ClubDiscover, a subsidiary of Capital OneJCB Co., Ltd.MastercardUnionPay",

      "Criminals use hidden code to copy payment data while the purchase still goes through normally. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How attackers slip skimmers into checkout pages",
      "Attackers usually enter through weak points that are easy to overlook. Common entry paths include vulnerable third-party scripts, outdated plugins and unpatched content management systems. Once inside, they inject JavaScript directly into the checkout flow. The skimmer monitors form fields tied to card data and personal details, then quietly sends that information to attacker-controlled servers.",
      "Why web skimming attacks are hard to detect",
      "To avoid detection, the malicious JavaScript is heavily obfuscated. Some versions can remove themselves when they detect an admin session, which makes inspections appear clean. Researchers also found the campaign uses bulletproof hosting. These hosting providers ignore abuse reports and takedown requests, giving attackers a stable environment to operate. Because web skimmers run inside the browser, they can bypass many server-side fraud controls used by merchants and payment providers.",
      "Who Magecart web skimming attacks affect most",
      "Magecart campaigns impact three groups at the same time:",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card dataMerchants whose checkout pages are compromisedPayment providers that detect fraud after the damage is done",
      "Shoppers who unknowingly give up card data",
      "Merchants whose checkout pages are compromised",

      "Simple protections like virtual cards and transaction alerts can limit damage and expose fraud faster. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe as a shopper",
      "While shoppers cannot fix compromised checkout pages, a few smart habits can reduce exposure, limit how stolen data is used, and help catch fraud faster.",
      "Virtual and single-use cards are digital card numbers that link to your real credit or debit account without exposing the actual number. They work like a normal card at checkout, but add an extra layer of protection. Most people already have access to them through services they use every day, including:",
      "Major banks and credit card issuers that offer virtual card numbers inside their apps",
      "Mobile wallet apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay generate temporary card numbers for online purchases, keeping your real card number hidden.",
      "Some payment apps and browser tools that create one-time or merchant-locked card numbers",
      "A single-use card typically works for one purchase or expires shortly after use. A virtual card can stay active for one store and be paused or deleted later. If a web skimming attack captures one of these numbers, attackers usually cannot reuse it elsewhere or run up repeat charges, which limits financial damage and makes fraud easier to stop.",
      "Transaction alerts notify you the moment your card is used, even for small purchases. If web skimming leads to fraud, these alerts can expose unauthorized charges quickly and give you a chance to freeze the card before losses grow. For example, a $2 test charge on your card can signal fraud before larger purchases appear.",
      "Use strong, unique passwords for banking and card portals to reduce the risk of account takeover. A password manager helps generate and store them securely.",

At the same time, Apple says Apple Intelligence will still run on the device and through its Private Cloud Compute system. In other words, Apple controls how user data flows, even if the underlying models come from Google.",
      "The joint statement from Apple and Google",
      "Here is the full joint statement from the two companies:",
      "\"Apple and Google have entered into a multi-year collaboration under which the next generation of Apple Foundation Models will be based on Google's Gemini models and cloud technology. These models will help power future Apple Intelligence features, including a more personalized Siri coming this year.",
      "\"After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users. Apple Intelligence will continue to run on Apple devices and Private Cloud Compute, while maintaining Apple's industry-leading privacy standards.\"",
      "That last line is critical. Apple is clearly trying to reassure users that privacy remains central, even with Google's technology involved.",

      "A long-delayed Siri overhaul finally moves forward",
      "A more personalized Siri is one of the biggest promises tied to this deal. Apple had already previewed major Siri improvements but ran into development problems. Reports described internal frustration, bugs and delays that pushed the revamped assistant further out than planned. This partnership helps explain why. By leaning on Gemini, Apple can accelerate Siri's evolution instead of trying to solve every AI challenge internally. The result should be a smarter assistant that better understands context, handles complex requests and integrates more deeply across Apple apps.",
      "Behind-the-scenes pressure at Apple",
      "This deal did not happen in a vacuum. Apple has faced criticism for moving too slowly on AI while rivals pushed ahead. Apple had reportedly been in talks to license a custom version of Gemini for Siri and was expected to pay roughly $1 billion per year, though the official announcement did not confirm any financial terms.",
      "Apple has also reshuffled its AI leadership. The company recently hired Amar Subramanya as vice president of artificial intelligence. He replaced John Giannandrea, who stepped down from the role after leading Apple's AI strategy since 2018.",
      "Antitrust questions loom",
      "There is also a regulatory angle. Apple and Google already face scrutiny for their long-standing search agreement. That partnership came under renewed attention after U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google holds a monopoly in online search, while still allowing payments to Apple to keep Google as the default search engine on iPhones. This new AI collaboration could attract fresh attention from antitrust regulators who worry about powerful tech companies becoming even more intertwined.",

      "What this means for you",
      "For those of you using Apple devices, the impact is straightforward. You should see smarter Apple Intelligence features arrive faster, starting with a more capable Siri. Tasks like summarizing messages, handling complex reminders and understanding context across apps should improve. At the same time, Apple insists your data stays protected. Apple Intelligence will still rely on device processing and Private Cloud Compute, rather than funneling personal data directly into Google's systems.

      "Apple's partnership with Google marks a turning point in its AI story. Instead of going it alone, Apple is betting that combining its privacy-focused platform with Google's AI muscle is the fastest path forward.

      "A new mobile app from China is going viral for a reason that feels both unsettling and familiar. It exists to answer one basic question for people who live alone: Are you still alive? The app is called \"Are You Dead?\" and it has surged to the top of China's paid app charts. It also climbed into the top ten paid apps in the United States. Its popularity reflects more than curiosity. It highlights how many people now live by themselves and worry about what happens if something goes wrong.",

      "How the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app works",
      "The app's design is intentionally simple. After paying about $1.15, users add an emergency contact and agree to check in every two days.",
      "Here is how it works in practice:",
      "Users tap a large green button with a cartoon ghost to confirm they are OKIf they miss two check-ins, the app sends an email alert on the third dayThe alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",

      "If they miss two check-ins, the app sends an email alert on the third day",
      "The alert tells the emergency contact that something may be wrong",
      "That is it. No tracking. No health data. No constant monitoring. The goal is reassurance, not surveillance. On its English-language page, the app goes by the name Demumu. The developers describe it as a \"lightweight safety tool\" meant to make solitary life feel less risky. For now, the app is available only on Apple's App Store for iPhone and iPad.",
      "Why the \u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 app went viral in China",
      "The app debuted quietly in May. Then it took off. It is now the top-paid app on China's Apple App Store and ranks sixth among paid apps in the U.S. The surge reflects a major social shift. More people in China live alone than ever before. One-child policies, rapid urbanization and work that pulls people far from their families all play a role. By 2030, China is projected to have around 200 million one-person households. At that scale, a simple safety check turns from a niche idea into a mass-market tool.",
      "Why users say the app provides peace of mind",
      "For many users, the app is not a joke. It is a safety net. One 38-year-old user told reporters he lives far from his family and worries about dying alone in a rented apartment. He set his mother as his emergency contact so someone would know if something happened to him. Others echoed a similar sentiment online. People living alone, introverts, unemployed workers and those dealing with depression said the app offers peace of mind without requiring constant interaction. Some users even reportedly framed it as a practical courtesy to loved ones rather than a morbid tool.",

      "The name of the app sparks debate",
      "Not everyone is comfortable with the app's blunt branding. Some users say the name is too dark and turns people away. Several suggested a simple fix: rename it \"Are You Alive?\" One commenter argued that death in this context is not only literal but social. A softer name might signal care rather than fear. Some users said they would gladly pay for the app if it sounded less grim. The developers appear to be listening.",
      "What the developers of the app plan next",
      "The app is built by a small Gen Z team at Moonscape Technologies. In public statements, the company said it plans to refine the product based on feedback.",

      "Reconsidering the app's name",
      "Those changes matter in a country where about one in five people is now over age 60.",
      "Loneliness is not just a problem in China",
      "The app's success abroad suggests the issue is global. In the U.S., living alone is becoming the norm rather than the exception. According to recent census data, 27.6% of U.S. households had just one person in 2020. That figure was under 8% in 1940. Loneliness trends among younger men are especially striking. A Gallup poll found that about one in four Gen Z and millennial men in the U.S. report feeling lonely. That rate is higher than in peer countries like France, Canada, Ireland and Spain. Against that backdrop, an app that asks people to check in feels less extreme and more revealing.",

      "\"Are You Dead?\" succeeds because it addresses a fear many people rarely say out loud. As more people live alone, the worry is not only about loneliness but also about invisibility.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation has issued a warning about a growing cyber threat that turns everyday QR codes into spying tools.",
      "According to the bureau, a North Korean government-sponsored hacking group is using a tactic known as quishing to target people in the United States.",
      "The goal is simple. Trick you into scanning a QR code that sends you to a malicious website. From there, attackers can steal login credentials, install malware or quietly collect device data.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "WHATSAPP WEB MALWARE SPREADS BANKING TROJAN AUTOMATICALLY",
      "The FBI is warning Americans about a growing cyber threat that uses QR codes to steal data and spy on victims, tying the attacks to a North Korean hacking group. (Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images)",
      "What quishing is and why it works",
      "Quishing is short for QR code phishing. Instead of clicking a suspicious link in an email, the victim scans a QR code that hides the real destination. QR codes themselves are harmless. The danger lies in the link embedded inside them. Once scanned, the link can redirect users to fake login pages, malware downloads or tracking sites. Because QR codes feel familiar and fast, many people scan them without thinking twice. That split second of trust is exactly what attackers rely on.",
      "Who is behind the attacks",
      "The FBI says the activity is tied to a hacking group known as Kimsuky. The group has operated for years as a cyber espionage arm for North Korea. What is new is the delivery method. According to the FBI, the QR code-based attacks began in May 2025. In one example, attackers posed as a foreign policy advisor and emailed a think tank leader with a QR code that linked to a fake questionnaire. Scanning the code sent the victim to a malicious site designed to harvest information.",
      "What happens after you scan the QR code",
      "Once a victim lands on one of these sites, several things can happen. Some pages prompt users to download files that contain malware. Others mimic mobile login portals for popular services such as Okta, Microsoft 365 or VPN services. Even if no form is filled out, the site can still collect device details. That includes IP address, operating system, browser type and approximate location. Over time, that data helps attackers build intelligence profiles on their targets.",
      "Why QR code phishing attacks are highly targeted",
      "The FBI describes these campaigns as spear phishing rather than mass spam. That means the emails are crafted for specific individuals. The language context and sender details are tailored to look relevant and credible. When an email feels personal, people are more likely to trust it. That is why these attacks are especially dangerous for professionals, researchers, executives and anyone working in policy or technology.",
      "Why QR code phishing threats are growing",
      "QR codes are everywhere now. Restaurants, parking meters, event tickets and ads all rely on them. As their use grows, so does the opportunity for abuse. Attackers know people are conditioned to scan without hesitation. That makes caution more important than ever.",
      "Ways to stay safe from QR code phishing",
      "The FBI says one of the best defenses against quishing is slowing down. QR codes remove the visual clues people rely on, so a few extra checks can make a big difference.",
      "Treat QR codes like links in emails. If you did not expect it, do not scan it. QR codes sent by email, text or messaging apps are a common entry point for quishing attacks. Criminals rely on curiosity and urgency to push you into scanning without thinking.",
      "Always confirm who sent the QR code. If a message claims to come from a coworker, vendor or organization, reach out through a separate channel before scanning. A quick call or direct message can stop a phishing attempt cold.",

      "Federal investigators say hackers are using \"quishing,\" or QR code phishing, to lure victims to malicious websites that steal credentials and device data. (Jens Schlueter/Getty Images)",
      "QR code phishing often leads to fake mobile login pages. Attackers mimic sign-in screens for email, VPNs and cloud services to steal usernames and passwords. If a QR code takes you to a login page, close it and visit the site manually instead.",
      "Once a QR code opens a page, check the address bar. Look for misspellings, extra words or unfamiliar domain endings. A strange URL is often the only warning sign that the site is malicious.",
      "Strong antivirus software adds an extra layer of protection against quishing. Security tools can block known phishing sites, stop malicious downloads and warn you before harmful pages load. This is especially important on mobile devices, where QR codes are most often scanned.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some quishing sites collect device and location data even if you do nothing. A data removal service helps reduce how much personal information is publicly available online. That makes it harder for attackers to target you with convincing spear phishing emails that include QR codes.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "The breach is believed to have exposed two distinct sets of records. One is personal and program-related data tied to more than 672,000 Medicaid and Medicare Savings Program recipients, including addresses, case numbers, demographic details and medical assistance plan names, and another 32,000 Division of Rehabilitation Services customers whose names, addresses, case details and referral information were also exposed over multiple years.",

      "What happened in the Illinois DHS data breach",
      "As spotted by Bleeping Computer, the Illinois Department of Human Services disclosed that unauthorized access to one of its systems led to the exposure of records tied to approximately 700,000 Illinois residents. The affected data was connected to individuals who interacted with DHS programs, which can include benefits, assistance services and support programs across the state.",
      "According to the agency, the breach involved personally identifiable information. While officials have not publicly released every technical detail, DHS confirmed that sensitive records were accessed, prompting notifications to impacted individuals. As is typical in cases like this, the investigation is ongoing, and the full scope of how the intrusion occurred is still being reviewed.",
      "For residents, the key issue is not just that data was accessed, but the type of data DHS holds. Government agencies like DHS often store names, addresses, dates of birth, case numbers and, in some instances, Social Security numbers or benefits-related information. Once that data escapes, it can be misused in ways that last for years.",
      "Why breaches like this are especially risky",
      "When a private company is breached, you can often change a password or close an account. Government data is different. You can't change your Social Security number easily. You can't erase past interactions with public assistance programs. That makes breaches involving state agencies particularly dangerous.",
      "Exposed records can be used for identity theft, fraudulent benefit claims, phishing scams and long-term impersonation. Criminals often combine government data with information from other breaches to build detailed profiles that make scams far more convincing. Even if there's no immediate misuse, stolen data frequently resurfaces months or years later.",
      "As with many large breaches, DHS has stated that it is taking steps to secure its systems and prevent similar incidents in the future. That's an expected response. But for affected residents, the burden of protection now shifts largely to you.",

These services can alert you to suspicious activity involving your Social Security number or credit file before the damage spreads. Beyond basic monitoring, full identity theft services can help with recovery, paperwork and financial reimbursement if fraud occurs. This can be especially useful after large-scale government breaches.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "For the first time, Americans with depression will soon be able to use a prescription brain-stimulation device at home.",
      "The approval comes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and marks a major shift in how mental health conditions may be treated. The newly approved device is called FL-100, and it comes from Flow Neuroscience.",
      "It is designed for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. Clinicians can prescribe it as a stand-alone treatment or alongside antidepressants and therapy. This decision matters because depression affects more than 20 million adults in the U.S. Roughly one-third do not get enough relief from medication or stop taking it due to side effects.",

      "SIMPLE DAILY HABIT MAY HELP EASE DEPRESSION MORE THAN MEDICATION, RESEARCHERS SAY",
      "Flow Neuroscience has gotten approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its FL-100 prescription brain-stimulation device. (Flow Neuroscience)",
      "How the Flow FL-100 works",
      "The FL-100 uses transcranial direct current stimulation, often shortened to tDCS. This technology delivers a gentle electrical current to the prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain tied to mood regulation and stress response. In many people with depression, activity in this area is reduced. By stimulating it, the device aims to restore healthier brain signaling over time. The system looks like a lightweight headset and pairs with a mobile app. Patients use it at home for about 30 minutes per day while clinicians monitor progress remotely.",
      "The clinical results behind the approval",
      "The FDA based its decision on a randomized controlled trial that evaluated home use under remote supervision. Participants who received active stimulation showed meaningful improvement on clinician-rated and self-reported depression scales. After 10 weeks of treatment, patients experienced an average symptom improvement of 58% compared to a control group. Many users reported noticeable changes within the first three weeks. The study was published in the journal Nature Medicine, adding credibility to the findings. Side effects were generally mild and short-term. Reported issues included skin irritation, redness, headaches, and brief stinging sensations at the electrode sites.",

      "A growing shift toward tech-based mental health care",
      "Flow's device has already been used by more than 55,000 people across Europe, the U.K., Switzerland and Hong Kong. In the U.K., it is prescribed within parts of the public health system. Company leaders say the U.S. approval opens the door for broader access to non-drug treatment options. The momentum is not isolated. In 2025, researchers at UCLA Health developed another experimental brain-stimulation approach, signaling rapid growth in this field. Together, these advances suggest that at-home neuromodulation may soon become a standard part of depression care rather than a fringe option.",
      "When will the device be available",
      "Flow expects the FL-100 to be available to U.S. patients in the second quarter of 2026. A prescription will be required, and the companion app will be available on iOS and Android. The company also plans to explore additional uses for its platform, including sleep disorders, addiction, and traumatic brain injury.",

      "Flow Neuroscience\u2019s FL-100 headset delivers mild electrical stimulation to the brain and can be prescribed for home use under medical supervision. (Flow Neuroscience)",
      "What to know before trying Flow",
      "Flow is FDA approved for adults 18 and older with moderate to severe major depressive disorder, and it requires a prescription from a licensed healthcare provider. Doctors can recommend it on its own or alongside medication or therapy. The headset is non-invasive and designed for home use, but it is not meant for emergency situations or people considered treatment resistant. It also does not replace crisis care or immediate mental health support. Most users wear the headset for about 30 minutes per session. Mild tingling, warmth, skin irritation or headaches can happen, especially early on. These effects are usually short-lived and monitored by a clinician through the companion app.",
      "Flow pairs with a mobile app that guides treatment and supports remote clinical oversight. Your provider sets the treatment plan, and the device follows prescribed settings to ensure safe use. Pricing and insurance coverage may vary once the device becomes available in the U.S. Some patients may access Flow through clinics, research programs, or as it becomes more widely adopted in routine depression care. The bottom line is simple. Flow adds another evidence-based option, not a cure and not a one-size-fits-all solution. For people who have struggled to find relief, having another clinically proven choice can matter a lot.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you care about struggles with depression, this approval expands the range of real treatment options. It offers a non-drug path that can be used at home under medical guidance. For patients who have not responded well to medication or who experience unwanted side effects, this could provide another way forward. It also reflects a broader trend toward personalized, tech-enabled mental healthcare.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This FDA approval feels like a real turning point. For years, brain stimulation for depression stayed locked inside clinics. Now it can happen at home with a doctor still guiding the process. That matters for people who have tried medications, dealt with side effects or felt stuck with limited options. This device will not be the right answer for everyone, but it gives patients and doctors one more proven tool to work with. And for many people living with depression, having another option could make all the difference.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses Elon Musk's possible priorities as he exits his role with the White House and explains the urgent warning for iPhone users to update devices following a 'massive security gap.'",
      "The Apple iPhone is the most popular smartphone in the United States and one of the most widely used devices in the world. An estimated 1.6 billion people rely on iPhones every day. That massive user base also makes the platform a prime target.",
      "Over the past few weeks, Apple has been sending out warnings about a serious security flaw. New data suggests the risk could affect roughly half of all iPhone users.",

      "Apple is warning iPhone users about a serious Safari security flaw that could leave hundreds of millions of devices vulnerable if updates are delayed. (Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "What Apple discovered in Safari and WebKit",
      "Late last month, Apple confirmed two critical vulnerabilities in WebKit. WebKit powers Safari and every browser that runs on iOS. According to Apple, the flaws were used in an extremely sophisticated attack that targeted specific individuals. The problem allowed malicious websites to trick iPhones and iPads into running harmful code. Once that happens, attackers could gain control of the device, steal passwords or access payment information. In simple terms, visiting the wrong website could have been enough.",
      "Why millions of iPhones are still exposed",
      "Apple moved quickly to release a fix. The patch is included in the latest software update. The problem is that many people have not installed it yet. Estimates suggest that about 50 percent of eligible users have not upgraded from iOS 18 to iOS 26. That would leave around 800 million devices vulnerable worldwide. Data from StatCounter paints an even worse picture. It estimates that only 20 percent of users have updated so far. Once security details become public, the risk grows fast. Attackers know exactly what to exploit.",
      "iPhone and iPad models at the highest risk",
      "Apple says the following devices are affected if they are not updated:",
      "iPhone 11 and lateriPad Pro 12.9-inch 3rd generation and lateriPad Pro 11-inch 1st generation and lateriPad Air 3rd generation and lateriPad 8th generation and lateriPad mini 5th generation and later",

      "New data suggests nearly half of all iPhone users worldwide may still be exposed to a critical WebKit exploit Apple says was actively used in attacks. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Why upgrading is the only real protection",
      "There is no setting to flip and no safe browsing habit that fixes this issue. The vulnerability lives deep inside the browser engine. Security experts say there is no workaround or user behavior that meaningfully reduces the risk. Installing the latest software is the only effective defense. Apple is no longer offering a security-only update for users who want to stay on iOS 18. Unless your device cannot run iOS 26, the fix is only available through iOS 26.2 and iPadOS 26.2.",
      "Steps to update your iPhone or iPad now",
      "Updating is quick and usually painless. If automatic updates are enabled, the fix may already be installed.",

      "Make sure your device is connected to Wi-Fi and has enough battery life or is plugged in.",
      "Pro tip: Use strong antivirus software",
      "Keeping your iPhone updated is critical, but it should not be your only line of defense. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by scanning malicious links, blocking risky websites and alerting you to suspicious activity before damage is done.",
      "This matters even more when attacks rely on compromised websites or hidden browser exploits. Security software can help catch threats that slip through and give you extra visibility into what is happening on your device.",
      "Think of it as backup protection. Software updates close known holes, while strong antivirus tools help guard against the next one.",

      "Apple rarely uses language like \"extremely sophisticated\" unless the threat is serious. This flaw shows how even trusted browsers can become attack paths when updates are delayed. Waiting weeks or months to update now carries real consequences. If you use your iPhone for banking, shopping or work, this update should be treated as urgent.",

      "Because Brightspeed focuses on underserved areas, many customers rely on it as their primary internet provider. That makes any potential breach especially concerning.",
      "A closer look at Crimson Collective",
      "Crimson Collective is not new to high-profile targets. In October, the group breached a GitLab instance tied to Red Hat, stealing hundreds of gigabytes of internal development data.",
      "That incident later rippled outward. In December, Nissan confirmed that personal data for about 21,000 Japanese customers was exposed through the same breach.",
      "More recently, researchers say Crimson Collective has targeted cloud environments, including Amazon Web Services, by abusing exposed credentials and creating rogue access accounts to escalate privileges.",
      "In other words, the group has a track record that makes its claims hard to ignore.",
      "What this could mean for customers",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/new-personal-evtol-promises-personal-flight-under-40k",
    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 08:17:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The Rictor X4 electric aircraft promises personal flight for $39,900, making eVTOL technology accessible with 50 mph speeds and truck-bed portability.",
    "story": [
      "A aviation company is turning heads with an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle.",
      "Personal electric aircraft have teased us for years. They look futuristic, promise freedom from traffic, and usually come with prices that put them out of reach or timelines that feel uncertain. Recently unveiled at CES 2026, the Rictor X4 entered that conversation with some bold claims.",
      "It is a single-passenger electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft designed to make short-range personal flight more accessible and far more affordable. If those promises hold up, it could change how we think about flying for everyday trips.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "CES 2026 put health tech front and center, with companies showcasing smarter ways to support prevention, mobility and long-term wellness. (CES)",
      "TECH STARTUP, MAJOR AIRLINE PARTNER TO LAUNCH ELECTRIC AIR TAXI SERVICE",
      "What the Rictor X4 actually is",
      "The Rictor X4 uses a multirotor design with eight propellers spread across four carbon fiber arms. Those arms fold inward when the aircraft is not in use, allowing it to fit in the bed of a pickup truck. The aircraft focuses on low-altitude flight and short hops rather than long journeys.",
      "Key specs include:",
      "Top speed of about 50 mphMaximum flight time of 20 minutesPayload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "Top speed of about 50 mph",
      "Maximum flight time of 20 minutes",
      "Payload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "It can lift off and land vertically like a helicopter, then transition into forward flight once airborne. Rictor describes its mission as light aerial mobility, which essentially means short-distance commuting and professional applications.",
      "Inside the X4's propulsion and power system",
      "According to Rictor, the X4's propulsion system is built around stability and redundancy rather than raw speed. Each axis uses a coaxial dual-motor configuration designed to provide consistent thrust during low-altitude flight.",
      "Key propulsion details include:",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axisPeak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axisMaximum continuous power output of 10 kW120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axis",
      "Peak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axis",
      "Maximum continuous power output of 10 kW",
      "120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Together, these systems aim to deliver controlled, predictable flight with built-in safety margins, especially during takeoff, landing and hover.",
      "The Rictor X4 is a single-passenger electric aircraft designed for short-range, low-altitude flight with a folding multirotor layout. (Rictor)",
      "Safety systems and flight control in the Rictor X4",
      "Rictor puts safety at the center of the X4's design. The aircraft uses a semi-solid state battery system with dual battery redundancy, which helps enable a controlled landing if one battery module fails. In addition, an emergency parachute system provides backup protection during critical situations. At the same time, a centralized flight control system actively manages propulsion, attitude and overall system health. This system continuously monitors key flight data to help maintain stability in changing conditions.",
      "Beyond software, the hardware plays an important role. The X4 features 63-inch carbon fiber folding propellers in a 4-axis, 8-propeller configuration. Together, they support a payload of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot. According to Rictor, the aircraft is designed to operate at noise levels below 65 decibels, although independent testing has not yet been published. Finally, Rictor's proprietary Dynamic Balance Algorithm adjusts the output of all eight motors in real time. As a result, the X4 can maintain a stable hover even in side winds rated up to Level 6.",
      "The FAA rule that could make personal flight easier",
      "One of Rictor's most attention-grabbing claims involves regulation. The company says the X4 is designed to comply with FAA Part 103, which governs ultralight vehicles in the U.S. If operated within Part 103 limits, the X4 could be flown legally without airworthiness certification or a pilot's license. Rictor says this is enabled by autonomous pre-programmed flight paths and very low altitude operation, reportedly as low as three meters above ground. It is worth noting that Part 103 still carries operational restrictions, including where and how flight can occur. Final compliance depends on real-world use and FAA interpretation.",
      "Designed to fold, transport, and recharge",
      "Portability is a major focus. Rictor says the X4 folds down to about 42 cubic feet, which makes it compact enough to transport in the bed of a pickup truck. The company also highlights in-vehicle charging support while parked or on the move, positioning the X4 as something that can be transported and recharged alongside ground vehicles rather than stored at an airfield.",
      "AIR TAXI SERVICE PLANS EVTOL RIDES FROM ALL THREE NYC AIRPORTS",
      "The price that resets expectations",
      "The Rictor X4 carries a launch price of $39,900 with a $5,000 deposit. That alone separates it from most personal eVTOLs currently discussed in the market. The aircraft is produced by Kuickwheel Technology, Rictor's parent company. According to the company, first customer deliveries are scheduled for Q2 2026. As with any aircraft launch, timelines remain aspirational until production units reach customers.",
      "Why this matters now",
      "Personal eVTOLs have lived in a narrow space between concept and reality. High costs, regulatory hurdles and safety concerns have slowed adoption. If Rictor delivers an aircraft that performs as described while operating within ultralight rules, it could expand personal flight beyond niche enthusiasts and into practical short-range use. Now it comes down to whether the company can deliver on what it's promising.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Rictor X4 brings together aggressive pricing, compact design and regulatory positioning in a way we have not seen before. Folding propellers, redundant safety systems and Part 103 alignment make it one of the most ambitious personal eVTOL launches to date. The unanswered questions center on real-world performance, regulatory interpretation and production readiness. Until aircraft are flying outside controlled demonstrations, healthy skepticism remains warranted. Still, this is one of the most compelling personal flight announcements to come out of CES in recent years.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 He has been in exile for 47 years, a crown prince without a country. But Reza Pahlavi says his moment has arrived and insists his fellow Iranians will soon topple the clerical regime that ousted his father.",
      "\"They are demanding a credible new path forward,\u201d Pahlavi said at a news conference in Washington last week. \u201cThey have called for me to lead.\"",
      "Although sometimes dismissed as politically irrelevant over the years, Pahlavi has gained new prominence in recent weeks as Iranian protesters chanted his name and reposted his social media appeals.

But in Trump\u2019s second term, Pahlavi has struggled to get an inside track with the president\u2019s advisers, though he says he is in communication with the administration. The president\u2019s top envoy, Steve Witkoff, has held talks with Pahlavi.",
      "Although Trump has threatened to intervene if Iran executes protesters, the Iranian government presents a more complicated challenge for any possible regime change operation than Venezuela, where the administration earlier this month captured the president there, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Unlike Venezuela, Iran has a more fractured opposition, and so far there are no signs of major defections inside the regime\u2019s security forces, according to Western officials.",
      "On Thursday, Trump left open the possibility that he might order military action against the regime, saying a U.S. \u201carmada\u201d was headed to the region. \u201cWe have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won\u2019t have to use it. We\u2019ll see,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.",
      "A White House spokesperson pointed to Trump's comments about Pahlavi when asked for comment.",
      "In public opinion surveys in Iran over the past three years, Pahlavi receives stronger support than any other opposition figure by a wide margin, with about 30% of Iranians strongly backing him, according to polling overseen by Ammar Maleki of the University of Tilburg in the Netherlands. But about 30% oppose him and another third are undecided.",
      "\u201cHe does have support. He can mobilize people,\u201d said Andrew Ghalili, policy director at the National Union for Democracy in Iran, a nonprofit that has worked closely with Pahlavi.",
      "Pahlavi\u2019s higher profile is partly due to the Iranian regime\u2019s systematic repression of critics and dissidents, almost all of whom are behind bars, said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank.",
      "\"His stock has certainly gone up recently,\" Vaez said. \"The Iranian regime has eliminated any competition,\" he added, \"because every Iranian dissident who could potentially mobilize masses inside the country is sitting in a prison.\"",
      "Pahlavi\u2019s famous late father helps fuel his appeal among some Iranians, as there is a degree of nostalgia for a time when the country was not an international pariah and clerics did not restrict social freedoms. But the shah\u2019s reign divides Iranians, who recall the royal court\u2019s lavish lifestyle and repression by a vast secret police force.",
      "Elliott Abrams, who was Trump\u2019s special envoy to Iran and also to Venezuela in Trump\u2019s first term, said Pahlavi\u2019s popularity reflects the deep-seated outrage Iranians harbor against the government in Tehran.",
      "\u201cPahlavi\u2019s new prominence is a natural product of hatred of the regime by the Iranian people. To chant his name or say 'Long live the Shah' represents the most complete rejection possible of the Islamic Republic,\u201d Abrams said.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean people want a monarchy, even a constitutional monarchy, but he clearly has a support base and might have a role.\u201d",
      "One European diplomat with experience in the region said that Pahlavi may not be a future political leader of Iran but \"he represents an idea that captures people\u2019s imagination at a crucial moment.\"",
      "Dressed in a smart blue suit and striped tie, Pahlavi\u2019s appearance before television cameras last week resembled an event for a head of state or a political candidate. He cited a plan he had crafted with experts on how Iran could avoid chaos, revive the economy and move smoothly to a stable democracy.",
      "\u201cMy team of experts have developed a plan for the first 100 days after the regime\u2019s collapse and the long-term reconstruction and stabilization of our country,\u201d he said.",
      "The exiled crown prince has proposed to organize opposition to the regime around a short list of universal principles: Iran\u2019s territorial integrity, separation of religion and state, individual liberties and equality of all citizens and the Iranian people\u2019s right to decide a democratic form of government.",
      "Pahlavi, who bears a striking resemblance to his father, says it would be up to Iranians to choose their future government and leaders, and that for the moment he would merely serve as a leader of a democratic transition.",
      "As for the legacy of his father\u2019s rule, Pahlavi prefers not to dwell on the subject, saying, \u201cI\u2019m here to make history, not to write it.\u201d",
      "But some of Pahlavi\u2019s supporters are staunch advocates of restoring an absolute monarchy and have clashed online in harsh tones with those who disagree with their view. That has caused tension among opposition activists, experts say, and could pose a challenge in persuading wavering officials to break away from the regime.",
      "\u201cIt inhibits his ability to peel people away from the regime if they feel like \u2026 the next rulers of Iran could come after them,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in an online briefing on Wednesday.",
      "Some opposition activists are wary of forging ties with Pahlavi due to what they say is the fanaticism of some of his followers. But other activists say there is no room for internal feuding at a moment when the regime appears so weak and adrift, and that Pahlavi has to be part of any opposition coalition.",
      "Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, head of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation, a think tank that studies Iranian politics, said there\u2019s no doubt Pahlavi \u201cis the most recognized leader within the opposition.\u201d",
      "But he said Pahlavi, who has not set foot in Iran since his family was pushed into exile in 1979, lacked a genuine political organization inside Iran \u201cthat is able to provide leadership for the protests, not just on social media, but actually at the street level.\u201d",
      "Such an organization would ensure that the protests are disciplined and sustainable over time, Batmanghelidj said.",
      "The way that Pahlavi and other opposition activists have approached the protests \u201craises questions about their readiness to really lead a political movement.\u201d",
      "He drew a comparison to Maria Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader who despite years of experience mobilizing resistance to authoritarian rule could not secure President Trump\u2019s support.",
      "\u201cIf Machado, with her deep organizing experience, couldn\u2019t win the trust of the Trump administration, how can Pahlavi?\u201d"

      "Newly filed internal documents show how Google viewed its work with schools as a way of turning children into lifelong customers \u2014 while the company simultaneously acknowledged research suggesting that YouTube, one of Google\u2019s main platforms, can be unsafe and distracting.",
      "In a 2018 presentation, one slide noted that the public sees YouTube as problematic for students because there is \u201cNo way to block unsafe content, comments, ads,\u201d a challenge without a workable solution. A presentation last updated in 2024 said some survey respondents blamed YouTube for keeping them awake at night, among other negative effects on their well-being.",
      "At the same time, other presentations described how Google\u2019s growing presence in schools \u2014 through Chromebooks as well as its learning platforms and YouTube \u2014 helped the company build a \u201cPipeline of future users.\u201d",
      "One internal November 2020 presentation slide said acclimating children to Google\u2019s ecosystem in school would hopefully lead them to use its products as adults: \u201cYou get that loyalty early, and potentially for life.\u201d Another undated slide deck suggested imagining a world where \u201cParents ask their children \u2018Why aren\u2019t you watching more YouTube?\u2019\u201d and \u201cSchool Administrators shift budgets from Textbooks to YouTube subscriptions.\u201d",
      "Education experts and parent advocates who are concerned about schools overusing devices for instruction said the documents shed new light, in candid detail, on the business motivations behind one of the biggest technology companies marketing its products to teachers and school administrators.",
      "\u201cIt just proves the kind of fear that we\u2019ve all had,\u201d said Jared Cooney Horvath, a cognitive neuroscientist and education consultant who recently wrote a book criticizing technology in schools. \u201cThese companies speak about learning, but to them, learning is just the cover they\u2019re using for these practices of \u2018How do we get customers now\u2019 and \u2018How do we keep them for life.\u2019\u201d",
      "Do you have a story to share about technology in education? Contact reporter Tyler Kingkade",
      "The internal Google records, which were heavily redacted, were filed by plaintiffs Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California as part of a major lawsuit in which families, school districts and state attorneys general are suing several technology giants \u2014 Meta, ByteDance, Snap and Google \u2014 claiming that the corporations purposely marketed addictive and damaging social media to children. Snap settled its portion of the suit this week, on undisclosed terms, as the other companies move closer to trial over questions of whether they were obligated to warn schools of their platforms\u2019 negative effects or to implement more restrictions for young users.",
      "The companies have broadly argued that the plaintiffs are inaccurately describing their products, blaming them for harm they did not cause and incorrectly seeking to hold them accountable for content created by users, which they are protected against under a law commonly referred to as Section 230.",
      "Hundreds of school districts joined the litigation, but a judge chose six last year to proceed to trial first. A Kentucky district will be the first school system to go to trial in June.",
      "Google didn\u2019t answer questions from NBC News about the purpose and audience of the internal documents that were included in court filings, but Jack Malon, a Google spokesperson, said in an email that the \u201cdocuments mischaracterize our work.\u201d Malon added that while the company does not directly market YouTube to schools, \"we have responded to meet the strong demand from educators for high-quality, curriculum-aligned content. Administrators maintain full control over platform usage and schools must obtain parental consent before granting access to students under 18.\"",

      "Sarah Gardner, CEO of Heat Initiative, a parent activist group critical of social media platforms, found the newly released Google files alarming. She wants to see schools and political leaders put more guardrails on technology in classrooms to ensure that the products benefit students.",
      "\u201cThese documents confirm that suspicion that there are ulterior motives to companies pushing technology into classrooms,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cAnd so we need to be asking why we\u2019re letting them do that.\u201d",
      "When schools began installing bulky desktop personal computers in the 1990s, they mostly bought Apple products, taking advantage of discounts the company offered.",
      "While Microsoft Windows gained ground in the 2000s, schools shifted toward Google after it debuted the Chromebook in 2011, and the company has dominated the education computer hardware market for the past decade. Schools now account for 80% of all purchases of Chromebooks, according to market research firms. Google said in 2017 that more than half of all American public school children use Google applications and products for classwork and stated in 2021 that over 170 million students and teachers worldwide use them.",
      "Schools also use YouTube, with varying restrictions. Some give students and teachers free rein, while others block it entirely. Teachers can embed YouTube videos in course content through Google\u2019s specialized education platform. Google requires students to have parental permission to access YouTube on school devices.",
      "\u201cInsofar as we are looking at how teachers are engaging with YouTube content, we are trying to make it easier for them to do it,\u201d Kathryn Kurtz, global head of youth and learning at YouTube, said in a March 2025 deposition that was partially unredacted this week. \u201cAnd one of the things that we heard is that teachers wanted to be able to show YouTube video even if their school had made the determination that they wanted to block access to YouTube.\u201d",
      "Google has argued in recent court filings that YouTube can\u2019t be that much of a problem for the school districts suing because they still use it to communicate with families and they allow students and teachers to use it on campus.",
      "The internal Google documents were made public several days after a U.S. Senate hearing on concerns about the overuse of technology in public schools.",
      "Horvath, the neuroscientist, and three other witnesses argued that school-issued laptops and tablets can distract children and that schools too frequently use unproven digital tools when research shows analog ways of learning are more effective. Ahead of the hearing, the two largest teachers unions, the American Library Association and 14 education trade groups wrote a letter defending education technology and urging federal lawmakers not to restrict students\u2019 access or screen time.",
      "Stacy Hawthorne, board chair of the Consortium for School Networking, an association for school technology officials that signed the letter, is concerned that some are conflating social media, which can cause problems for children, with technology more broadly, which can help students learn.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big chasm between \u2018Social media is bad for kids\u2019 and \u2018We need to pull computers out of schools,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Kurtz, from YouTube, said in her deposition that the company had not measured the effectiveness of YouTube to improve students\u2019 learning and did not have data to show its content boosted students\u2019 grades, graduation rates or test scores.",
      "One internal Google presentation, which is undated, conceded that using YouTube for learning is hard because the platform is distracting and disorganized. It showed an example in which YouTube recommended \u201cWill Ferrell Hilarious Acceptance Speech\u201d from user \u201ccocksandballs123\u201d to someone who had searched for content about \u201clinear equations.\u201d",
      "Justin Reich, an associate professor of digital media at MIT and the director of the university\u2019s Teaching Systems Lab, said YouTube is caught between tailoring its product to schools and appealing to a vast global audience.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no capitalist way to win by making your product less engaging,\u201d he said."

      "Season 4 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d is heating up as the trust between the Traitors becomes fractured and a devious twist is introduced that will send another innocent Faithful home.",
      "Episode 6 of the season, arriving on Peacock Jan. 22, opened with the cliffhanger from the previous episode being resolved. Fans learned if one of the players chose to take a shield in the most recent mission, which would allow the Traitors to commit another murder. But that was just a taste of all the drama that unfolded during the hour.",
      "By the end of the episode, the Faithfuls had planned a coup, and one Traitor decided to turn on another, leading to tension between the trio. Read on for a recap of Episode 6, including the introduction of the next murder in plain sight, below.",
      "Episode 6 \u2018Planning A Coup\u2019",
      "The episode picks up where the cliffhanger left off, with the players learning if a murder happened during the night. One by one, each player safely arrives at breakfast, confirming that no one took a shield during the previous mission. Viewers then see a flashback of the moment last night when host Alan Cumming informs the Traitors that they will not be able to commit a murder. In the turret, the Traitors \u2014 Lisa Rinna of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,\u201d Candiace Dillard Bassett of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d and Rob Rausch of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6 \u2014 decide that they will banish comedian Ron Funches the next night and murder \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d star Colton Underwood since he suspected Rinna was a Traitor.",
      "After breakfast, Underwood continues to share his theory about Rinna being a Traitor, hoping to draw more suspicion toward her. But the rest of the players still believe that Funches is a Traitor. Meanwhile, Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir has another idea. He proposes that eight Faithfuls get together and form a group, ensuring they will have a majority at the next Round Table.",
      "In the car on the way to the mission, Underwood throws out Rinna\u2019s name again. He previously explained in his confessional that he wanted to say Rinna\u2019s name to as many players as possible to see who defends her. But Rausch, who was in the car with Underwood, realizes that a trap is being set and tells the group it is possible Rinna is a Traitor.",
      "When the group arrives at the mission, Cumming explains that there is $18,000 available to add to the prize pot. The mission is being held at the creepy cabin in the woods seen in previous seasons. The players have to enter the cabin and listen to a set of clues. Then, in pairs, they must run to a nearby gravesite and stand in front of the tombstone with the name of the person who matches the clues. One burial site has two shields, but if a duo takes them then they won\u2019t add gold to the prize pot.",
      "All the duos except Dillard Bassett and Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski are correct with their guesses, banking $15,000 for the prize pot. At the end of the mission, Cumming informs the remaining three players that no one collected a shield.",
      "Back at the castle, Weir pitches his plan again to get eight players together and vote out Underwood. In the kitchen, Rausch tells a group that he doesn\u2019t believe Funches is a Traitor, confusing Dillard Bassett and Rinna because of the plan they discussed earlier in the episode.",
      "When Weir approaches Rausch and tries to include him in his group of eight, the Traitor senses that a coup is forming. (Hence, the title of the episode). Rausch panics because Underwood is a close ally but he also doesn\u2019t want to vote out Funches.",
      "In another room, Underwood pulls Rinna aside and attempts to execute a plan that he even acknowledges in his confessional \u201cmight be really, really dumb.\u201d \u201cInstead of trying to banish a Traitor, I\u2019m going to try to hold one hostage,\u201d he tells the cameras. He then informs Rinna that he will vote for Funches on one condition: \u201cI will protect you at the Round Table if you protect me in the turret.\u201d",
      "Rinna repeats that she is a Faithful and shuts down his plan for an alliance.",
      "\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d pro Mark Ballas speaks up first at the Round Table and points out that Funches has been on the chopping block four days in a row. Funches pushes back, mentioning that other players have been wrong about their suspicions but he is the only person still being blamed for \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams being banished in Episode 2.",
      "\u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish calls out Underwood next for wrongfully targeting \u201cBig Brother\u201d star Tiffany Mitchell. Weir agrees with her and adds that Underwood makes him \u201cfeel like a puppet.\u201d",
      "But, the conversation circles back to Funches. He says that if the other players think they will find clarity from voting him out, then so be it. He goes around the table and compliments everyone, which makes some of them doubt he is a Traitor.",
      "Underwood uses this opportunity to publicly call out Rinna. He lists his evidence, highlighting Rinna voting for Williams despite her being a fellow housewife. Rinna defends herself but some of the players seem convinced. In a confessional interview, Rausch says that this is a pivotal moment in the game and \u201ceverything is on the line.\u201d",
      "When it is Rausch\u2019s turn to vote, Funches leads with five votes and Rinna and Underwood are tied with four. Rausch says he trusts Underwood and believes Funches is a Faithful. So, he votes for Rinna, marking the first time this season a Traitor has betrayed one of their own. \u201cAs a Faithful, it is my job to get Traitors out of the game,\u201d he says.",
      "However, his plan backfires. Ballas casts the deciding vote for Funches which sends him home.",
      "\u201cThis was very hard for me,\u201d Funches says while standing on the Circle of Truth. \u201cI don\u2019t trust many people and I felt not trusted. And I understand that this road is completely fake so that probably makes it hard to see someone that\u2019s real. I always spoke my truth no matter what and that\u2019s why, again, inside and outside of this game, I am truly Faithful.\u201d",
      "Cumming says he feels \u201cdisappointment and dejection\u201d in the room after Funches\u2019 banishment. \u201cSo, I have something to rouse you from your melancholy,\u201d he announces. \u201cAs we have reached the halfway point of my wicked game tonight, I will be holding a great banquet in my castle hall. And I want you to drink, feast and celebrate life, the greatest gift of all. See you there.\u201d",
      "In their confessionals, Rinna says Rausch betrayed her and Dillard Bassett says he needs to explain his vote.",
      "Cumming speaks directly to the audience and admits he \u201chasn\u2019t been entirely honest with\u201d the players. The episode then flashes back, again, to the last meeting in the turret. Cumming informs the Traitors that they must commit their next murder \u201cin front of everyone.\u201d He presents them with a \u201ccursed amulet\u201d and says one of them must wear it to the banquet. The first Faithful who touches the jewel will be \u201ccursed to death.\u201d Cumming says, \u201cThis will be the toughest, most high stakes murder this castle has ever seen.\u201d Rinna decides she will be the one to wear the amulet and complete the task.",
      "Back to the fallout between the trio after the Round Table, the Traitors quietly meet in the kitchen. Rinna tells Rausch she doesn\u2019t trust him anymore. He explains that it would have looked suspicious to the other players if he voted for Underwood or Funches when it is publicly known how close he is to them.",
      "The episode ends with Rinna, Rausch and Dillard Bassett contemplating who will be their next victim. Episode 7, which will feature the extravagant banquet and the next murder, will be released Thursday, Jan. 27."

      "Growing up in Minnesota with three older brothers, he never thought it would be possible as a professional hockey player to come out in the 2000s.

      "Williams, who portrays NHL hockey player Shane in the series, also thanked Kortuem for his bravery \u201cand sounding like a really cool guy.\u201d",

      "Pop superstar Taylor Swift called \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d actor Justin Baldoni an expletive in a text message with Blake Lively, according to messages unsealed Tuesday as part of an ongoing legal battle.",
      "The messages were unsealed as part of Lively\u2019s lawsuit against Baldoni, her co-star in the 2024 film \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Wayfarer Studios and others, litigation that has been going on for over a year.",
      "According to the court document, which Lively\u2019s lawyers filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Swift wrote, \u201cI think this bitch knows something is coming because he\u2019s gotten out his tiny violin.\u201d",
      "In the motion, Lively\u2019s lawyers confirmed the quoted language but disputed the defense\u2019s assertion that it was said while Swift and Lively were discussing \u2014 on Dec. 4 and 5, 2024 \u2014 a forthcoming New York Times article that reported that Baldoni and the CEO of Wayfarer had launched a \u201cretaliatory \u2018smear campaign\u2019\u201d against Lively.",
      "Representatives for Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday night.",
      "Swift licensed a song for \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d but was not otherwise involved in the film, Swift\u2019s spokesperson said last year, when there was an attempt to subpoena her as a possible witness in the trial.",
      "Sigrid McCawley, a member of Lively\u2019s legal team, said Tuesday that the new filing includes \u201cdamning\u201d statements about Baldoni from other people.",
      "\u201cThe newly unsealed, damning documents show the consistent reaction numerous women, cast, crew, executives, partners, co-host and even his own PR team had working with Justin Baldoni,\u201d McCawley said.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, said in a statement released by Wayfarer\u2019s public relations team that they are confident Baldoni\u2019s name will be cleared.",
      "\u201cAs stated all along, and reflected in our clients motions, as well as in messages from Sony discussing Ms. Lively\u2019s behaviors, the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law,\u201d Freedman said.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s filing by Lively\u2019s lawyers deals with the re-filing of public versions of exhibits that were part of an earlier motion by Lively\u2019s attorneys opposing a summary judgment in the case.",
      "An attorney for Baldoni previously called the allegations in the lawsuit \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Lively first filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department on Dec. 20, 2024, that accused Baldoni of sexual harassment during filming of \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d as well as retaliation against Lively after she raised issues about his on-set behavior.",
      "She filed a federal civil lawsuit against Baldoni, who is also a co-founder and co-owner of Wayfarer Studios and who directed \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d on Dec. 31, 2024. In February, she filed an amended complaint against Baldoni, the company, the company\u2019s CEO and others.",
      "Baldoni filed a countersuit against Lively seeking $400 million, but a federal judge dismissed it in June and formally ended it in November after an amended complaint was not filed by a court-set deadline.",
      "Lively\u2019s amended complaint, which does not name a dollar amount, seeks compensatory and punitive damages. It alleges that there was a \u201cmulti-tiered plan\u201d by Baldoni and his team to destroy her reputation.",
      "In \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Lively plays Lily Bloom, a woman who moves to Boston with a dream of opening a flower shop and marries neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid, played by Baldoni. The film explores Bloom\u2019s decision to break a cycle of domestic abuse and divorce him.",

      "Mandy Patinkin and Kathryn Grody tell listeners of their podcast, \"don't listen to us,\" but Jonathan Bailey, incoming star of a \"Sunday in the Park with George\" revival, may want to hear this.",
      "In 1984, Mandy Patinkin originated the role of George Seurat in Stephen Sondheim's \"Sunday in the Park with George\" on Broadway, opposite Bernadette Peters. The musical was inspired by the painting of Seurat's real life masterpiece, \"A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.\"",
      "Earlier this month, it was announced that Bailey and Ariana Grande will become the latest actors to step into the roles of George and Dot in a London revival of the musical, opening in the summer of 2027.",
      "While stopping by TODAY Jan. 21 with wife Grody, Patinkin offers some simple advice for Bailey as he steps into the part: \"Just enjoy every single second of it.\"",
      "\"You are embarking on one of the privileges of your life,\" Patinkin says. \"What James (Lapine, playwright) and Stephen (Sondheim) wrote is one of the greatest gifts of my life. The word that is the north star of my existence ... \u2018Connect, George. Connect.'\"",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018connect,\u2019 the music, the lyrics, the story \u2014 I just beg you to, even on your worst day, enjoy every second of it. This is as good as it gets,\u201d Patinkin adds.",
      "It\u2019s a philosophy he\u2019s been able to put into practice with the launch of his podcast with Grody, \u201cDon\u2019t Listen to Us.\u201d Described as an \u201cElder Seinfeld,\u201d Patinkin and Grody\u2019s podcast involves candid conversations with themselves and the listeners who come to them seeking advice, all moderated by their son Gideon.",
      "The trick?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a normal conversation. We do no preparation,\u201d Grody says.",
      "\u201cZero. We don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Patinkin adds.",
      "Despite initial skepticism at the prospect of a podcast, Patinkin says they soon found themselves \u201cunbelievably moved\u201d by certain questions. They\u2019ve since settled into having fun and feeling relaxed with the show, with Patinkin comparing it to a \u201cfascinating roulette wheel ... we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to end.\u201d",
      "For Grody, a self-proclaimed lover of people, the podcast also allows her to make new friends.",
      "\u201cI think when you\u2019re older, you need to make new ones so there\u2019s somebody left,\u201d she says.",
      "Her husband, however, is not as \u201cpeople-oriented,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI like dogs,\u201d he adds.",
      "But for about one hour \u2014 \u201cnot more,\u201d Patinkin specifies \u2014 the podcast forces him to, as \u201cSunday in the Park with George\u201d teaches, connect.",
      "\u201cThe two of us participating in this ends up forcing him into meeting all sorts of new people and enlarging his circle and then we can share that experience,\u201d Grody says.",
      "An experience Patinkin says he can\u2019t wait to have is seeing the \u201cSunday in the Park with George\u201d revival. The show, which will run at the Barbican Theatre, does not yet have an opening date, but tickets go on sale in May.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thrilled for them, and I\u2019m thrilled for us,\u201d Patinkin says. \u201cThat piece, when I did it, you\u2019re in it, you\u2019re living it, you don\u2019t see it.

      "When Elizabeth Smart was abducted from her bedroom as a 14-year-old in 2002, her 9-year-old sister was in the room and heard the kidnapper\u2019s voice when he threatened her if she alerted their parents.",
      "Months later, Mary Katherine Smart\u2019s ability to place a name with the voice became a major break in the case as police searched tirelessly to find her older sister. Mary Katherine remembered the voice of a man who briefly worked on her family\u2019s Salt Lake City home and police identified as Brian David Mitchell.",

      "Mary Katherine\u2019s crucial role in Smart\u2019s ultimate rescue is examined in the new Netflix documentary \u201cKidnapped: Elizabeth Smart.\u201d",
      "In an exclusive interview on TODAY on Jan. 21, Elizabeth Smart reflected on the important role Mary Katherine played in her story.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s my hero,\u201d Smart said. \u201cShe saved me.\u201d",
      "The documentary recounts how authorities initially investigated members of Smart\u2019s family, including her father, as well as a former contractor who worked on the house, as they searched for the abductor. Both were dead ends, but Mary Katherine\u2019s remembrance of the man whose voice she heard proved to be invaluable information.",
      "Mary Katherine appears in the documentary, where she describes her inability to sleep after the abduction and feeling like she was \u201calone on an island\u201d because police did not want her speaking to anyone about the crime.",
      "\u201cHad she not remembered who had kidnapped me, who\u2019s to say that I would be here today?\u201d Elizabeth Smart said on TODAY. \u201cThe police all had their suspects, and my captor I don\u2019t even think was on their radar at all. So she is my hero.\u201d",
      "Smart was abducted at knifepoint in 2002 from her bedroom in her family\u2019s home by Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee. The couple took Smart to a tent in the mountains outside Salt Lake City, where Smart said Mitchell raped and tortured her nearly every day of the nine months she was held captive.",
      "She was rescued on March 12, 2003, when two couples called the police believing they had just seen Elizabeth Smart after recognizing Mitchell and Barzee from an episode of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted.\u201d",
      "Mitchell is currently serving a life sentence after being convicted of kidnapping and raping Smart. Barzee, who was sentenced to 15 years for her role in the kidnapping, was released from a Utah prison in 2018. She was then arrested in May 2025 for visiting two Salt Lake City parks, which violated her status as a sex offender.",
      "Smart, 38, has since become an advocate for survivors of sexual violence and a child safety activist through her work with the Elizabeth Smart Foundation. She also has helped other kidnapping victims recover and shined a spotlight on other survivors of abduction.",
      "In 2023, she marked 20 years since being rescued with a message of gratitude. She opened up about what it\u2019s like when people approach her to thank her for sharing her story or admire her perseverance.",
      "\u201cInitially it was so shocking because that was not me,\u201d she said on TODAY. \u201cI was happy to blend in. I wasn\u2019t anybody, and so that was very overwhelming when I first got home. And then I would also say it was surprising just like how long and how many people still remembered my story.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd now it\u2019s been 20-plus years, and so it\u2019s not uncommon to have people come up and approach me, but I guess even sitting here 20-plus years later is surprising,\u201d she continued. \u201cI would never have imagined this for my life. I never would\u2019ve thought my life would go in this direction.\u201d",
      "She also is a married mother of three children with husband Matthew Gilmour. Smart spoke about whether she has talked to her daughters Chloe, 10, and Olivia, 8, and son James, 6, about her story.",
      "\u201cOne of the best pieces of advice I was given as far as parenting goes: When your kids start asking questions, that\u2019s the right time to start talking about it,\u201d Smart said. \u201cAnd honestly, that started way before I was prepared, way before I ever thought it would come up.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think my oldest was, like 3 years old when she started asking me questions, like where was I going, what was I doing, why was I doing it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd that was shocking. I was not ready. Honestly I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m still ready. But I would say that opened the door to start having those conversations, and then just as they have grown, I\u2019ve been able to let that conversation grow as well.\u201d"

      "An intensive manhunt ensued, while the search for her abductor put members of her family under stressful scrutiny. Meanwhile, Smart was in captivity in the mountains outside Salt Lake City under the control of a violent kidnapper.",
      "The saga of Smart's abduction, her terrifying ordeal and her rescue are the subject of the new Netflix documentary, \"Kidnapped: Elizabeth Smart,\" which began streaming on Jan. 21.",
      "Here is what to know about her story.",
      "What Happened to Elizabeth Smart?",
      "Smart was a 14-year-old girl living in Salt Lake City with her parents, four brothers and younger sister when she was abducted by a man at knifepoint from her bedroom on June 5, 2002. Her family describes her in the documentary as a normal teenager who enjoyed playing the harp and hanging out with her friends and siblings.",
      "Her younger sister, Mary Katherine, who was 9 years old at the time, was in the room during the abduction. Mary Katherine says in the documentary, and elsewhere like in the investigative book \"In Plain Sight: The Startling Truth Behind the Elizabeth Smart Investigation,\" the man told her he would kill her if she alerted their parents.",
      "She recognized his voice, but couldn't pinpoint who it exactly was, and her parents were unaware of the intruder. Mary Katherine ultimately alerted them to Elizabeth being taken at 3:58 a.m., and they discovered a screen had been cut in the kitchen and a window was open.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t keep her from harm\u2019s way,\" their father, Ed Smart, says in the documentary. \"That just repeats over in your mind, over and over and over again.\"",
      "A bloodhound brought by police tracked Elizabeth's scent up a hill in the backyard, but lost the scent when the dog reached the street.",
      "Who Was Investigated for Elizabeth Smart's Abduction?",
      "As police began searching for leads, they looked into Ed Smart and his two brothers, David and Tom Smart, who are Elizabeth's uncles.",
      "Ed Smart recalled his reaction after his now-ex-wife, Lois Smart, told him that law enforcement did not believe he had nothing to do with their daughter's disappearance.",
      "\"I was overwhelmed to the point that I was shaking and couldn\u2019t stop shaking,\" he says in the documentary.",
      "Ed Smart added that the scrutiny on him and his brothers also had the negative effect of fewer people wanting to help the effort to find Elizabeth.",
      "After the police found nothing suspicious among the family, the spotlight turned to Richard Ricci, a contractor who had been in a dispute with Ed Smart after doing work on the family's home. Ricci had a criminal past and was brought in for questioning.",
      "He vehemently denied having anything to do with Smart's abduction in interrogation footage seen in the film.",
      "On July 24, 2002, police said someone tried to break into the home of Smart's cousin, using a similar method to the break-in at the Smarts' home. Ricci was in jail at the time, and Mary Katherine Smart says in the documentary that she knew Ricci was not the man in the room that night.",
      "Ricci died from an aneurysm in his prison cell while Elizabeth was still missing.",
      "How Did Police Identify Elizabeth Smart's Abductor?",
      "Weeks after Smart's abduction, Mary Katherine Smart said she remembered a name associated with the man's voice she heard that night: Immanuel.",
      "The girls had met the man while he was preaching on the street in Salt Lake City months earlier, and he had done work on the Smarts' home. According to the book \"In Plain Sight: The Startling Truth Behind the Elizabeth Smart Investigation\" by Lee Benson and Tom Smart, Lois Smart saw Mitchell begging for money on the street and handed him money and her husband's phone number, in case he was willing to work. He worked for five hours at the Smarts' home.",
      "The family ultimately released the sketch to the crime show \"America's Most Wanted,\" which led a man to call Ed Smart's brother, Tom Smart, and say the man in the sketch might be his brother-in-law, Brian David Mitchell.",
      "What Happened to Elizabeth Smart After She Was Abducted?",
      "In the documentary, Smart describes her horrific treatment at the hands of Mitchell after being taken into the mountains into a tent by him and his wife, Wanda Barzee.",
      "\"I remember feeling like my doom was approaching,\" Smart said in the documentary. \"He said, 'I hereby seal you to me as my wife before God and his angels as my witnesses.'\"",
      "Smart screamed and was told if she screamed again, he would kill her. She said Mitchell then raped her in the tent, which continued throughout her captivity.",
      "\"I had gone from never even holding a boy\u2019s hand to being raped every day, multiple times a day,\" she said in the film.",
      "She remembered not even knowing the difference between consensual sex and rape at the time.",
      "\"I felt a lot of shame, and I felt like I was filthy. I felt like if my family knew what happened to me, would they still want me back?\" she said. \"Maybe it would be better if nobody ever found me.\"",
      "Smart said in the film that Mitchell also walked her around like a dog and forced her to drink alcohol until she vomited.",
      "\"More than anything, he loved power,\" she said. \"He loved feeling like he was in control.\"",
      "She also reflects on questions on why she didn't try to escape or alert others when Mitchell and Barzee took her to Salt Lake City for excursions.",
      "\"The thought of crying out did cross my mind, but I was 14, (and) I had been extremely abused for months,\" she said. \"When I disobeyed, I was raped. I did have food withheld from me. So when I made my bid for freedom, I wanted it to be a sure thing.\"",
      "How Was Elizabeth Smart Rescued?",
      "Smart had a few close calls before she was ultimately found. She said in the documentary that at one point she, Mitchell and Barzee were looking at maps in a Salt Lake City library when a homicide detective approached them and wanted to ask some question.",
      "Smart was in a long, white robe with a face covering, and Mitchell refused to let the detective pull it down, saying it was against their religion. The detective accepted the explanation and walked away.",
      "A nightclub patron described seeing the trio at a Salt Lake City establishment, where Barzee and Smart were dressed in the same white robes with face coverings.",
      "Smart also recalled another moment in which she could faintly hear her name being called in the woods, when searchers were presumably yelling out for her. She said Mitchell threatened to kill her if she tried to answer them.",
      "After being taken to a location outside San Diego, Smart said she convinced Mitchell to return them to Salt Lake City, so they took a bus to Sandy, Utah.",
      "On March 12, 2003, a person called local police saying they believed they had just seen Elizabeth Smart walking on the street after recognizing Barzee and Mitchell from the \"America's Most Wanted\" episode.",
      "Police cars pulled up alongside Smart, Barzee and Mitchell. After separating Smart from her captors, they asked if she was Elizabeth Smart.",
      "\"My captors were just right there,\" she said. \"I was terrified. I needed the safest answer I could possibly give.\"",
      "When the officers asked if she was Elizabeth Smart, she responded, \"If thou sayeth,\" confirming it was her.",
      "She was now 15 years old and had been missing for nearly 300 days.",
      "What Happened to Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee?",
      "Smart's rescue was not the end of her ordeal, as the court case involving Mitchell and Barzee dragged out until 2010.",

    "summary": "Reza Pahlavi, son of the Shah who ruled Iran until 1979, says he is ready to lead the country to democracy. But some Iranians, and President Trump, harbor doubts.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 He has been in exile for 47 years, a crown prince without a country. But Reza Pahlavi says his moment has arrived and insists his fellow Iranians will soon topple the clerical regime that ousted his father.",
      "\"They are demanding a credible new path forward,\u201d Pahlavi said at a news conference in Washington last week. \u201cThey have called for me to lead.\"",
      "Although sometimes dismissed as politically irrelevant over the years, Pahlavi has gained new prominence in recent weeks as Iranian protesters chanted his name and reposted his social media appeals. But it remains unclear if Pahlavi has the political organizing skills and enough support inside Iran \u2014 or in the White House \u2014 to help topple the regime and steer the country to a democratic future.",
      "Large-scale street protests that swept the country starting in late December have subsided after Iranian security forces opened fire on unarmed demonstrators, killing thousands, according to human rights groups.",
      "President Donald Trump has referred to Pahlavi as a \u201cnice guy\u201d but questioned whether the son of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi could be a future leader. \u201cHe seems very nice, but I don\u2019t know how he\u2019d play within his own country,\u201d Trump told Reuters earlier this month.",
      "In appearances on Fox News and elsewhere, Pahlavi has praised Trump for promising to come to the aid of protesters and said he believes the president is \u201ca man of his word.\u201d",
      "In Trump\u2019s first term, senior officials overseeing Iran policy stayed in close contact with Pahlavi and other opposition activists. But in Trump\u2019s second term, Pahlavi has struggled to get an inside track with the president\u2019s advisers, though he says he is in communication with the administration. The president\u2019s top envoy, Steve Witkoff, has held talks with Pahlavi.",
      "Although Trump has threatened to intervene if Iran executes protesters, the Iranian government presents a more complicated challenge for any possible regime change operation than Venezuela, where the administration earlier this month captured the president there, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Unlike Venezuela, Iran has a more fractured opposition, and so far there are no signs of major defections inside the regime\u2019s security forces, according to Western officials.",
      "On Thursday, Trump left open the possibility that he might order military action against the regime, saying a U.S. \u201carmada\u201d was headed to the region. \u201cWe have a massive fleet heading in that direction, and maybe we won\u2019t have to use it. We\u2019ll see,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.",
      "A White House spokesperson pointed to Trump's comments about Pahlavi when asked for comment.",
      "In public opinion surveys in Iran over the past three years, Pahlavi receives stronger support than any other opposition figure by a wide margin, with about 30% of Iranians strongly backing him, according to polling overseen by Ammar Maleki of the University of Tilburg in the Netherlands. But about 30% oppose him and another third are undecided.",
      "\u201cHe does have support. He can mobilize people,\u201d said Andrew Ghalili, policy director at the National Union for Democracy in Iran, a nonprofit that has worked closely with Pahlavi.",
      "Pahlavi\u2019s higher profile is partly due to the Iranian regime\u2019s systematic repression of critics and dissidents, almost all of whom are behind bars, said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank.",
      "\"His stock has certainly gone up recently,\" Vaez said. \"The Iranian regime has eliminated any competition,\" he added, \"because every Iranian dissident who could potentially mobilize masses inside the country is sitting in a prison.\"",
      "Pahlavi\u2019s famous late father helps fuel his appeal among some Iranians, as there is a degree of nostalgia for a time when the country was not an international pariah and clerics did not restrict social freedoms. But the shah\u2019s reign divides Iranians, who recall the royal court\u2019s lavish lifestyle and repression by a vast secret police force.",
      "Elliott Abrams, who was Trump\u2019s special envoy to Iran and also to Venezuela in Trump\u2019s first term, said Pahlavi\u2019s popularity reflects the deep-seated outrage Iranians harbor against the government in Tehran.",
      "\u201cPahlavi\u2019s new prominence is a natural product of hatred of the regime by the Iranian people. To chant his name or say 'Long live the Shah' represents the most complete rejection possible of the Islamic Republic,\u201d Abrams said.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean people want a monarchy, even a constitutional monarchy, but he clearly has a support base and might have a role.\u201d",
      "One European diplomat with experience in the region said that Pahlavi may not be a future political leader of Iran but \"he represents an idea that captures people\u2019s imagination at a crucial moment.\"",
      "Dressed in a smart blue suit and striped tie, Pahlavi\u2019s appearance before television cameras last week resembled an event for a head of state or a political candidate. He cited a plan he had crafted with experts on how Iran could avoid chaos, revive the economy and move smoothly to a stable democracy.",
      "\u201cMy team of experts have developed a plan for the first 100 days after the regime\u2019s collapse and the long-term reconstruction and stabilization of our country,\u201d he said.",
      "The exiled crown prince has proposed to organize opposition to the regime around a short list of universal principles: Iran\u2019s territorial integrity, separation of religion and state, individual liberties and equality of all citizens and the Iranian people\u2019s right to decide a democratic form of government.",
      "Pahlavi, who bears a striking resemblance to his father, says it would be up to Iranians to choose their future government and leaders, and that for the moment he would merely serve as a leader of a democratic transition.",
      "As for the legacy of his father\u2019s rule, Pahlavi prefers not to dwell on the subject, saying, \u201cI\u2019m here to make history, not to write it.\u201d",
      "But some of Pahlavi\u2019s supporters are staunch advocates of restoring an absolute monarchy and have clashed online in harsh tones with those who disagree with their view. That has caused tension among opposition activists, experts say, and could pose a challenge in persuading wavering officials to break away from the regime.",
      "\u201cIt inhibits his ability to peel people away from the regime if they feel like \u2026 the next rulers of Iran could come after them,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said in an online briefing on Wednesday.",
      "Some opposition activists are wary of forging ties with Pahlavi due to what they say is the fanaticism of some of his followers. But other activists say there is no room for internal feuding at a moment when the regime appears so weak and adrift, and that Pahlavi has to be part of any opposition coalition.",
      "Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, head of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation, a think tank that studies Iranian politics, said there\u2019s no doubt Pahlavi \u201cis the most recognized leader within the opposition.\u201d",
      "But he said Pahlavi, who has not set foot in Iran since his family was pushed into exile in 1979, lacked a genuine political organization inside Iran \u201cthat is able to provide leadership for the protests, not just on social media, but actually at the street level.\u201d",
      "Such an organization would ensure that the protests are disciplined and sustainable over time, Batmanghelidj said.",
      "The way that Pahlavi and other opposition activists have approached the protests \u201craises questions about their readiness to really lead a political movement.\u201d",
      "He drew a comparison to Maria Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader who despite years of experience mobilizing resistance to authoritarian rule could not secure President Trump\u2019s support.",
      "\u201cIf Machado, with her deep organizing experience, couldn\u2019t win the trust of the Trump administration, how can Pahlavi?\u201d"

      "Many Kurds have been left shell-shocked by the fighting with Syrian forces, the rapid shift in the balance of power and the loss of territory, with some saying they felt bereft after the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces\u2019 (SDF) had made sweeping contributions in the fight against ISIS.",
      "\u201cEveryone has abandoned us,\u201d Saleh al-Ali, a resident of Kobani, a Kurdish-majority city in the Ayn al-Arab district in northern Syria, told NBC News this week.",
      "Al-Ali, who said he works at a poultry farm in the Hasakah countryside, said he had traveled with his wife, their three young daughters and his ailing mother to the area about a week ago when clashes broke out between Syrian government forces and the SDF. The family tried to return to Kobani, but the roads were cut off, forcing them to flee for safety toward Qamishli.",
      "\u201cWe used to feel safe with the American military presence in northeast Syria,\u201d said al-Ali, 41. \u201cWe believed they were our guarantee and would never abandon us \u2014 especially after we sacrificed tens of thousands of our young people fighting alongside them against ISIS and helping rebuild what ISIS had destroyed.\u201d",
      "Syria\u2019s new leadership has struggled to consolidate authority in the war-ravaged country since the toppling of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime in December 2024, led by al-Sharaa\u2019s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group. While al-Sharaa has vowed to build a more unified and representative Syria, his rule has struggled with deep divisions and deadly sectarian clashes across the country.",
      "In a recent push, Syrian forces gained control over the Deir al-Zour and Raqqa provinces, plus parts of Hasakah province, with the SDF further announcing its withdrawal from al-Hol camp, where thousands of people with alleged links to ISIS are held, as Syrian government forces advanced into Hasakah."

      "Major Western allies chose to skip the ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with some voicing concerns that the body, which Trump plans to chair personally, could replace the United Nations.",
      "Trump, who has derided the U.N. for \"empty words\" that \u201cdon\u2019t solve war,\u201d said Thursday that the two bodies will work alongside each other, after having suggested earlier in the week that the board \"might\" replace it.",
      "With many allies absent, Trump was flanked at the event by leaders and representatives from Argentina, Turkey, Hungary, Bulgaria, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Qatar, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Morocco, Paraguay and Pakistan.",

      "What is the Board of Peace?",

      "In November, the U.N. Security Council approved a Board of Peace as part of a broader plan that included establishing a security force in Gaza.",

      "Trump said his board would work alongside the U.N., which he said has \"got tremendous potential.\" The two bodies together \"can be something very, very unique for the world,\u201d he said.",

      "\"Others will join,\" he said. \"Many want to be a part of this effort, because it is going to be a successful effort.\"",

      "Who isn't joining?",
      "The U.K., France, Norway, Sweden and Slovenia are among the countries to indicate they would not immediately be joining the body.",

Other media outlets quoted from the same letter received by other leaders.",
      "A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron told NBC News that at this stage, he \u201cdoes not intend to give a favorable response\u201d to the invitation, citing major questions over respect for the U.N. and whether the board might specifically act as a rival to the Security Council, the U.N.\u2019s most powerful body, created in the wake of World War II.",
      "In a separate statement, Macron\u2019s office said the board\u2019s charter \u201cgoes beyond the sole framework of Gaza and raises serious questions, in particular with respect to the principles and structure of the United Nations, which cannot be called into question.\u201d",
      "Trump responded by threatening late Monday to hit French wines and Champagnes with 200% tariff, apparently in an effort to pressure Macron to change his stance and join his board.",
      "The Kremlin also demurred about Putin\u2019s invitation. \u201cWe are currently studying all the details of this proposal, including hoping to contact the American side to clarify all the nuances,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists Monday.",

Orb\u00e1n said he \u201caccepted this honorable invitation,\u201d and Lukashenko formalized his country\u2019s ascension to the board Tuesday, Belarus\u2019 Foreign Affairs Ministry said on X.",
      "The list of those invited to participate runs to nearly two dozen, including countries as diverse as Kazakhstan, Vietnam, Canada and Australia, and it helps shine a light on the structure and remit of Trump\u2019s plan for Gaza\u2019s postwar governance, bringing the next phase of the U.S.-negotiated ceasefire into sharper focus.",
      "But in Israel, the plan has already been criticized by ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said Monday that it was time to explain to Trump that \u201chis plan is bad for the State of Israel and to cancel it,\u201d according to The Associated Press.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took a more diplomatic line, telling lawmakers that there were differences with the U.S. about the composition of the advisory committee accompanying the next phase in Gaza but that it would not harm his relationship with Trump, according to the AP.",

      "Israeli politicians have been highly critical of Trump\u2019s inclusion of diplomats from Qatar and Turkey on a separate advisory committee that will play a strong role in Gaza\u2019s administration. Both, which have also been invited to the Board of Peace, have strained relationships with Israel after its two-year war in Gaza. Netanyahu said Monday that no soldiers from those countries would be allowed into the Palestinian enclave.",
      "Another neighbor, the United Arab Emirates, said it had accepted the invitation Tuesday.",
      "In a statement Saturday, Netanyahu\u2019s office said that the Gaza executive committee was \u201cnot coordinated with Israel and is contrary to its policy\u201d and that he had instructed Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to contact Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "In the months since the U.N. Security Council approved Trump\u2019s ceasefire plan for Gaza, the White House\u2019s original concept appears to have broadened, and the board\u2019s new charter does not mention the enclave.",
      "Asked about the omission, a White House spokesperson said that board members would work \u201cto secure enduring peace in Gaza and around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is an issue of on-the-ground diplomacy and leverage, not creating some global cosmic superstructure,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington-based think tank. Trump\u2019s plan, he said, is \u201ctethered to a galaxy far, far away, not to the realities here on planet Earth.\u201d",
      "The charter also says Trump will serve as the inaugural chairman of the executive board who will vote on proposals put before it. \u201cSuch decisions shall go into effect immediately, subject to veto by the Chairman at any time thereafter,\u201d it says.",
      "The price tag, along with the board\u2019s guaranteed American dominance, might make membership a tough sell, Miller said.",
      "\u201cIf you sign up for the \u2018Board of Peace,\u2019 you will be aligning yourself with Trump\u2019s vision,\u201d said Miller, who worked closely on Middle East peace negotiations during his decades as an American diplomat. \u201cAdding a billion-dollar entry fee as if this is getting a seasonal membership at Mar-a-Lago has created the sense that this is not serious.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Defense Department said in an influential strategy document published Friday that the U.S. military's top focus is no longer on China but instead the homeland and Western Hemisphere.",
      "The priorities laid out in the 2026 National Defense Strategy, a quadrennial report last published in 2022, diverge significantly from those of the Biden administration, with efforts geared more inward such as securing the border and countering narcotics.",
      "The document says the country is not pursuing an isolationist agenda, but lays out why the U.S. wants allies to do more while the military focuses more on the homeland.",
      "The main focus on the homeland includes a section about the U.S. no longer ceding key terrain in the Western Hemisphere and how the Pentagon will provide President Donald Trump with \u201ccredible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain from the Arctic to South America, especially Greenland, the Gulf of America, and the Panama Canal.\"",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The No. 2 priority for the Pentagon is now China, which was characterized in the 2022 report as the most significant strategic competitor to the U.S., due in part to Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its aggressive behavior to U.S. allies.",
      "The new report says the U.S. does not seek to \u201cstrangle or humiliate\u201d China, but rather should deter the country \u201cthrough strength, not confrontation.\u201d It says the Pentagon will \u201cprovide the military strength for President Trump\u2019s visionary and realistic diplomacy, thereby setting conditions for a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific that allows all of us \u2014 the United States, China, and others in the region \u2014 to enjoy a decent peace.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon's third priority is to increase allies\u2019 burden sharing, including Canada and Mexico in the Western Hemisphere and Europeans on their continent. The fourth priority is rebuilding the defense industrial base.",
      "As the Russia-Ukraine war nears the four-year mark, Moscow gets a relatively brief mention in the report. Russia is described as a \u201cpersistent but manageable threat to NATO\u2019s eastern members for the foreseeable future,\u201d and that the Pentagon will ensure that American forces are prepared to defend against Russian threats \u201cto the U.S. Homeland.\u201d",
      "The report comes as Trump struggles to bring an end to a war he repeatedly said he could end on the first day of his second term, or even before he took office. It also comes on the heels of the arrest of Venezuela's now-deposed president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, by U.S. forces and Trump\u2019s push to acquire Greenland, though he\u2019s said he won\u2019t use force to achieve that goal.",
      "Unlike previous National Defense Strategy reports under Republican and Democratic presidents, the 2026 version is overtly political, with a focus on both President Joe Biden and earlier administrations.",
      "\u201cFor too long, the U.S. Government neglected \u2014 even rejected \u2014 putting Americans and their concrete interests first. Previous administrations squandered our military advantages and the lives, goodwill, and resources of our people in grandiose nation-building projects and self-congratulatory pledges to uphold cloud-castle abstractions like the rules-based international order,\" the report says.",
      "\"President Trump has decisively changed that, courageously putting Americans first to truly make America great once again,\" it says. \"We will be the sword and shield to deter war, with the goal of peace \u2014 but ready to fight and win the nation\u2019s necessary wars if called upon.\u201d"

      "On Thursday, Iranian officials offered the first official death toll.",

      "The move follows an executive order Trump issued on the first day of his second term last January saying the U.S. would withdraw from the WHO within a year. In recent days the Trump administration has also withdrawn the U.S. from dozens of other international organizations, including global climate talks, and established a Board of Peace chaired by Trump that critics say could undermine the United Nations.",
      "\u201cThis action responds to the WHO\u2019s failures during the Covid-19 pandemic and seeks to rectify the harm from those failures inflicted on the American people,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a statement.",
      "A spokesperson for the WHO said members of its executive board would discuss how to handle the U.S. withdrawal at their meeting next month. Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last week that the withdrawal would make both the U.S. and the rest of the world less safe.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really the right decision. I want to say it bluntly,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Rubio and Kennedy said the U.S. would continue to lead the world in public health, and that it would work with countries and \u201ctrusted health institutions\u201d using a more transparent model that \u201cdelivers real outcomes rather than the bloated and inefficient bureaucracy of the WHO.\u201d",
      "In a call with reporters earlier Thursday, HHS officials provided no details about whether those institutions have the laboratory credentials necessary for surveillance of emerging diseases.",

We no longer have access. We don\u2019t have that library card.\u201d",
      "Dr. Judd Walson, chair of the department of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to compare infectious disease notes between countries without a unifying group like WHO.",

      "Such surveillance is particularly useful when it comes to flu strains that pop up, like the H3N2 subclade K strain that has dominated the spread of flu so far this year.",
      "The exit from WHO has been in the works since the first Trump administration. As the coronavirus pandemic took hold in April 2020, Trump accused the WHO of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the crisis \u2014 specifically the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China.",
      "Rubio and Kennedy echoed those accusations in their statement Thursday, saying the WHO \u201cobstructed the timely and accurate sharing of critical information that could have saved American lives.\u201d",
      "They also said the WHO had refused to return the U.S. flag hanging outside its headquarters in Geneva, \u201carguing it has not approved our withdrawal and, in fact, claims that we owe it compensation.\u201d",

Earlier Wednesday, Trump gave a speech at the World Economic Forum in which he said that the U.S. needs to absorb Greenland for global security reasons and that European countries need to meet the demand.",

      "Trump\u2019s appearance at the conference comes amid the biggest crisis within the NATO alliance in decades. Longtime Western allies have cautioned that the rules-based international order is fraying as America threatens the sovereignty of smaller nations. The day before at Davos, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose country Trump has also targeted, said that the geopolitical landscape is undergoing not a \u201ctransition,\u201d but a \u201crupture.\u201d",

A lease agreement won\u2019t suffice, said Trump, a former real estate magnate.",
      "Trump told the audience that \u201cpsychologically, who the hell wants to defend a license agreement or a lease, which is a large piece of ice in the middle of the ocean, where if there is a war, much of the action will take place on that piece of ice. Think of it. Those missiles will be flying right over the center of that piece of ice.\u201d",

U.S. forces stepped in and kept the territory out of Hitler's hands. Now, America wants Greenland back. Denmark's defiance ignores the sacrifices American soldiers made, he suggested.",
      "\"Without us, right now, you'd all be speaking German and a little Japanese, perhaps. After the war, we gave Greenland back to Denmark. How stupid were we to do that? But we did it, but we gave it back. But how ungrateful are they now?\" Trump said.",
      "The audience listened largely in silence, according to a press pool report. There was some light laughter in the room, along with \u201cuncomfortable looks\u201d on the part of some of the attendees.",

      "He took a swipe at his predecessor, calling him \u201cSleepy Joe Biden,\u201d and said that people would be prosecuted over the 2020 election that made Biden president. Trump contends the election was \u201crigged,\u201d though there is no evidence of wrongdoing on a scale that would have reversed the outcome.",

      "\u201cThe problem with NATO is, we\u2019ll be there for them 100%, but I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d be there for us,\u201d he said.",
      "(After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack, NATO invoked Article V for the first time in its history \u2014 a clause stating that the attack on one member was an attack on all.)",
      "During a photo spray before his meeting with Trump, the NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte, sought to dispel Trump's concern that the alliance would abandon the U.S. in wartime.",
      "\u201cYou can be assured, absolutely, if ever U.S. will be under attack, your allies will be with you. Absolutely, there\u2019s absolute guarantee,\u201d Rutte told Trump. \u201cI really want to tell you this because this is important. It pains me if you think it is not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope that that\u2019s true,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In his speech earlier in the day, Trump also had harsh words for Canada. He said that Canada  \u201cgets a lot of freebies from us,\u201d but is not \u201cgrateful.\u201d",
      "\u201cI watched your prime minister yesterday,\u201d Trump said, in reference to Carney. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t so grateful.\u201d",
      "Before Trump spoke, NBC News interviewed one of his favorite foils: California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, who is attending the conference. Trump name-checked Newsom during his speech, calling him a \"good guy\" who \"I used to get along so great with.\"",
      "Newsom, a potential presidential candidate in 2028, said of Trump\u2019s tenure: \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary wrecking ball presidency and administration. And people understand it here. There\u2019s a deep understanding in the United States, the impacts are going to be outsized, the next five, 10, 15 years.\u201d"

      "There was a chill in the air in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, thousands of miles away from the World Economic Forum taking place in the Swiss city of Davos.

      "LONDON \u2014 An emotional Prince Harry appeared on the verge of tears as he gave evidence Wednesday in his final legal showdown with Britain's tabloid media.",
      "\u201cThey have made my wife\u2019s life an absolute misery,\u201d he said in London's High Court during questioning by his lawyer David Sherborne, referring to Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex. His life had been \u201ccommercialized\u201d since he was a teenager, he said.",
      "\u201cThe defense claim that I don\u2019t have any right to privacy is disgusting,\u201d added Harry, whose voice cracked at various points as he gave evidence.",
      "Harry, who is estranged from the royal family, testified in court for the second time as he leads a group of seven high-profile claimants, including Elton John and actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, in a privacy lawsuit against one of Britain's biggest news organizations, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL).",
      "They have accused ANL, the publisher of the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday newspapers, of using unlawful methods to snoop on them for sensational headlines, including tapping and hacking phones and obtaining private medical and financial records through deception, chiefly from 1993 to 2011.",
      "ANL has strenuously denied the allegations and called them \u201cpreposterous smears\u201d before the hearing began Monday.",
      "After a minor technical glitch delayed proceedings Wednesday, Harry, who was dressed in a dark suit, took questions from ANL\u2019s lawyer Antony White, who asked him whether information in the articles could have come from friends or social circles.",
      "\u201cThe kind of information that ends up in articles is not the kind of stuff that I would be talking about openly,\u201d Harry replied. He said later that sources \u201cwere used as a cover to make up quotes\u201d and \u201cdisguise the true origin of information.\u201d",
      "Buckingham Palace, in his experience, rarely corrected stories, Harry said. \u201cIt was more just ignore it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you complain, they double down on you, in my experience,\u201d he said, explaining why he had not objected to the articles at the time. He added that he had followed the family protocol of \u201cnever complain, never explain.\u201d",
      "Under the English civil court system, witnesses present written testimony, and after the assert that it\u2019s the truth, they are immediately put under cross-examination. Harry said in his 23-page witness statement that he was distressed and disturbed by the newspapers\u2019 intrusion into his early life and that it made him \u201cparanoid beyond belief.\u201d",
      "Harry broke with tradition in 2023 when he became the first senior royal in 130 years to give evidence in court during a lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People tabloids.",
      "King Edward VII had been the last to do so when he testified as a witness in part of a divorce case in 1870 and 20 years later in a slander trial over a card game, both while he was Prince of Wales and before he became king.",
      "Speculation has been rife about whether the end of Harry\u2019s case could lead to a reconciliation with his father, King Charles III, after years of mounting royal tensions.",
      "Prince William, Harry's older brother and the heir to the throne, and Princess Kate are in Scotland this week. Their spokesperson declined to comment on whether the trio would meet up, as did a spokesperson for Harry. Charles was in London; it was unclear whether he would meet up with his youngest son.",
      "Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, has blamed the tabloid press for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, and has been critical about their treatment of Meghan.",
      "He won a payout from MGN, and last January he was awarded substantial damages and an apology from News Group Newspapers, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper arm, which settled ahead of a trial.",
      "ANL has denied the allegations.",
      "In a submission to the court Monday, White said ANL's editors and journalists were \u201clining up\u201d to reject the claimants' \u201callegations of habitual and widespread phone hacking, phone tapping and blagging within the organization.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlagging,\u201d a violation of the U.K. Data Protection Act, is obtaining or disclosing someone\u2019s personal data without that person\u2019s consent.",
      "White\u2019s submission added that the claimants had \u201cfailed to establish that the most serious categories of alleged unlawful information gathering \u2014 phone hacking and phone tapping \u2014 took place at Associated at all, and their allegation of burglary to order was struck out by the Court. The allegation that these practices were \u2018habitual and widespread\u2019 at Associated\u2019s titles was simply untrue.\"",
      "The case is expected to last nine weeks."
